possibilities for an emerging field

Abstract

Brazilian social issues, in contributions brought together for the
first time in a thematic issue of a Portuguese-language magazine. In
this approach, statistics matter not as a scientific method or discipline,
but as cultural objects, artifacts that result from social practices of
classification, registration and comparison of different dimensions of
reality, developed by public and private institutions.
Figures, indicators, indices, percentages, rates and averages make
up the arsenal of proof and inference of technical and scientific elites,
going beyond the scope of application for which they were initially
created, to become categories of perception for multiple actors. Your

The interest for the social sciences lies in the fact that they transcend

purely mathematical language and acquire a public character. These are

numbers that “receive media attention, translate interests of different

social groups, provide arguments in the resolution of controversies, are

subject to diverse appropriations, lend themselves to erudite and lay,

theoretical and practical uses, being constantly readapted and resignified”
(Daniel, 2013, p. 12).

Sociologias, Porto Alegre, year 23, n. 56, Jan-Apr 2021, p. 20-40.

As they are public, these numbers give consistency to aspects of
reality considered socially problematic, but which are still diffuse and
controversial. They reveal opaque or invisible dimensions of reality
and the social bases of politics, the very essence of political sociology.
The investment in statistical forms makes it possible to stabilize what
is already present in the collective sensibility, but has not yet been
agreed, giving dimension and scale to what until then could only be
perceived in words, that is, qualitatively. For this reason, the
quantification of social facts is an important – and, until recently,
neglected – part of the processes of reproduction and transformation
of modern societies.

Over the last forty years, studies on quantification have been
formed from reference works in different areas. In a somewhat
abbreviated form , we point out some of the main ones. In historical
epistemology, works on the role of probability calculation and the
notion of risk in the formation of the human sciences and in the
rationalization of social life stand out (Daston; Krüger; Heidelberger,
1987; Hacking, 1990; Porter, 1995). Studies in Science, Technology
and Society brought contributions on the role of numbers in public
controversies and in the imposition of the definition of situation by
“calculation centers”, such as the laboratory (Latour, 1988; 2000).

Studies on identity, race and ethnicity revealed the role of censuses
and their classifications in establishing new categories of people
(Anderson, 1988; Anderson, 1993; Kertzer; Ariel, 1999; Loveman, 2014).

This is just one case of the more general trend pointed out by Boltanski

(1982) and Desrosières (1993) that, to gain recognition, groups are

interested in statistically institutionalizing categories compatible with their
aspirations. More recently, we witnessed a similar process in the attempt by

some French social scientists to introduce the category “precarious

intellectuals”, encompassing different cultural professionals, whose moral

greatness would be affected by the precariousness of work and the advance

of an increasingly utilitarian way of life (Tasset, 2014 ). Both

In turn, the reflections of the Anglo-Foucauldians on the regimes of

government and population management addressed statistics as a
technology for the production of “free” and calculating subjects, by providing

actors with norms and standards for their own aspirations and conduct

(Foucault , 2008; 2009; Rose; Miller, 1992; Rose, 1999; Miller, 2001; Dean,

1999). Finally, under direct inspiration from Pierre Bourdieu (1979), the

French pragmatism debate on equivalence conventions and the plurality of
logics of action (Boltanski, 1982; Desrosières, Thévenot, 1988; Boltanski,

Thévenot, 1991) provided a model to address the simultaneously real and

conventional character of statistics and its correspondence with different

modalities of criticism (Desrosières, 1993; Boltanski, 2009).

Taken together, these works called into question the performativity of

numbers in public and private life; its use as a social coordination tool ; its
effects on the distribution of resources, knowledge and opportunities; its

reactivity on people, transforming the ways they think and act about

themselves, alone or in relation to others. After all, the conversion of
qualities into quantities creates new things and new names, making certain

identities more real than others.

Although it originated from a solidarity movement between engineers and

administrators in the late 1930s, its existence only became formalized when

it became a statistical nomenclature in mobility and stratification analyses.

One example is the construction of cadres, a term that designates salaried
executives and which is fundamental to the occupational structure in France.

The examples above point to the heuristic potential of studies on
quantification in renewing interest and approach to themes dear to
the sociologies of work and stratification.
Another important front opened by the sociology of quantification
concerns the illumination of the statistical work of public agencies,
such as INSEE, in France, the Census Bureau, in the United States,
or IBGE and SEADE, in Brazil. In them, the space for creating work
programs and research agendas is directly linked to bureaucratic
microprocesses and power networks that determine what can and
what should be part of the attention list of public statistical agencies,
in which the technical domain gains great relevance. The negotiation
of a research program involves, in this sense, not only the conviction
of its political pertinence, but its technical viability, which depends on
the conceptual soundness and the networks of use that make statistics
stable and resistant to criticism (Desrosières, 2008).

To understand the work programs of statistical agencies, it is
necessary to analyze the clash of professional “truths”, who prefer to
focus on primary research, whose rules, techniques and methods can
be fully controlled (Lima, 2010). Data generated from administrative
records are seen with great caution and, therefore, left in the
background – with the exception of some economic and financial data

More than that, the repertoire of technical-scientific knowledge
effectively available in these agencies proves to be decisive in the
incorporation of new themes into their research agendas, demanded
by economic actors and social movements. Such is the case, for
example, of the pressures for expanding the strictly economic concept
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which today involve the inclusion
of domestic work, biodiversity and other forms of wealth compatible
with social and sustainable development. This helps to explain why
institutions that produce statistics seem more reluctant to quantify
more fluid themes, whose legal and conceptual bases do not exist or
remain in dispute (Comte, 1995).

public, which help to compose and construct relevant indicators for the IBGE

agenda, such as national accounts. However, contemporary forms of

objectifying reality pose considerable methodological challenges to the

production of knowledge. For Lima, new technologies, combined with

processes of compartmentalization and hyper-specialization of knowledge,

generate complex scenarios – data in increasingly greater quantities;

fragmented information that is not always capable of validation and/or

confirmation, as in the example of the Internet and fake news; instant

communication, social networks, among others – which are not capable of

being apprehended just through the use of traditional techniques for measuring

reality. In this process, public statistics agencies often find themselves without

references on the agenda of topics covered in a national or regional statistics

system and, as a result, end up reinforcing positions of institutional or even

methodological insulation (Lima, 2010 ).

The sociology of quantification not only allows us to understand the

social determinants of this isolation, but also shows the different actors and

organisms involved in the circuit of production, circulation and translation of

numbers that there are limitations and choices implicit in all statistical

procedures, insisting that it is impossible to offer technical solutions to conflicts

of interest that cannot be accommodated. Furthermore , the sociology of

quantification offers producers of statistical information reflective knowledge
about the effects and constraints of their practices, which has the advantage

of expanding their sociopolitical legitimacy, without compromising their

technical-scientific credibility (Camargo, 2009).

When presiding over the IBGE, Simon Schwartzman dedicated himself to

thinking about the translations that take place in statistical controversies,

taking into account the specific professional culture of data producers, guided by rules

Interestingly, the first wave of Brazilian works that today would easily fit

into the sociology of quantification were written by authors with academic

activity and who, at the same time, integrated or directed the main data

production agencies in the country. His concerns about the division of

statistical labor reflected this insertion.

and mixed values of science and bureaucracy, in an approach that is
partly Latourian and partly Mertonian (Schwartzman, 1999). Inspired
by this author, Nelson Senra, an IBGE researcher, focused on
producers in institutional spaces, highlighting the importance of
understanding who provides statistics and how this process is carried
out. His work examined how statistics are strained by the process of
distinguishing between what he called the “supply time” and “demand
time” of information. There would be here two antagonistic discursive
fields, which dispute an object for its ability to be counted or, on the
contrary, for its intrinsic individualities, that is, conflicts over what to
count and quantify, which cannot be completely accommodated
(Senra, 2005). The doctoral thesis by Renato Sergio de Lima (2005),
who was head of SEADE's division of socioeconomic studies, showed

how the pressure for public control of police actions in redemocratization
did not result in coordination between producers and users of criminal
statistics, leading to to a simultaneous and paradoxical movement of
growth in the stocks of data generated, on the one hand, and the
reinforcement of the opacity of numbers in the design of public security policies, on the other.
More recently, the proliferation of contemporary forms of
quantification, marked by the advent of “algorithmic governmentality”
(Rouvroy, 2015) and the dissemination of benchmarking in the State
and public service (Bruno; Didier, 2013), increased the interest of
social scientists beyond official statistics, including in Brazil. Different
initiatives have sought to demonstrate that the sociology of quantification
can be used to address, from a new angle, some of the central
problems of Brazilian society. In dialogue with historical sociology, the
doctoral thesis by Alexandre de Paiva Rio Camargo (2016) examined
the slow construction of the authority of numbers in Brazil and the
conditions of its conversion into a reference for collective action. A
process that, for the author, extends between the Empire, when
administrative statistics predominated over population ones, reflecting
the rationality of the Territorial State, and the First Republic, when interdependence was outlined

Then, the thematic dossier “quantifying in Brazil”, the result of
approaches between Brazilian and French researchers interested in the
topic, was organized by Emmanuel Didier for the magazine Statistique et Société

On the one hand, the crossings that constitute the tension of statistics as

instruments of proof and government, including new forms of quantification that

establish the legibility and instrumentation of the government of territories and

populations, highlight a model of contemporary rationality based on risk, surveillance

and technology.

Policy choices are presented as results of standardized analytical techniques;

public services are commodified and monitored by the ability to satisfy a clientele

made up of citizens, in a relationship that is reduced to efficiency and utility,

emptied of the principle of universality and protection that until then characterized

the modern State-

(Didier, 2019). In various ways, the collective of researchers gathered tried to

show, following the seminal tracks of Alain Desrosières, but also of Theodore

Porter, how statistics are, at the same time, an instrument of proof and of

government (Desrosières, 2008). From this intrinsic tension to the “science of the

State”, it is possible, on the one hand, to understand how problematic it can be to

quantify favelas (Motta, 2019), how illegal markets are produced by numbers as a

problem to be fought in alliances between political and economic elites (Rabossi ,

2019), the generalization of predictive surveillance and its promotion by quantifying

intervention time (Cardoso, 2019), but also how the objectification of shootings and

police operations by civil society creates new debates in the public space,

previously hidden by the absence of numbers (Hirata; Couto; Grillo; Olliveira,

2019). The articulations, therefore, of the use of numbers as instruments of proof

and government, as well as different possibilities of thinking about the crossing

between State and society, allow exploring, through a renewed perspective, classic

themes of the social sciences and relevant public issues.

In the field of public security, for example, the difficulty does not lie
in the production of criminal data per se, which have existed in Brazil
since 1871, but in the way in which they are compiled and how they are
mobilized to justify regimes of truth that aim to maintain practices that
feed back from the violence. That is, when choosing either to add the
deaths resulting from police intervention in the total number of registered
homicides and/or, on the contrary, when choosing to exclude such deaths
from this sum, there is, after all, a huge dispute about the which means
law, order and public safety. The clash moves from production time to
use time, in the idea that there is consensus that the numbers should be
generated, but there is conflict over what they translate and who can
have access to the details that would allow broader analyzes of the problem (Lima, 2005).

It can be said that the introduction of performance indicators was a
considerable advance in relation to the so-called “bravery award” (better
known as the “wild west bonus”), which, between 1995 and 1998,

This clash is reflected on several levels, such as, for example, the
incentives for police activity carried out by the governments of the State
of Rio de Janeiro. Since 2009, the Public Security Institute (ISP/RJ)
organizes the data for the “System of Goals and Follow-up of Results”,
based on the “Strategic Indicators of Crime”. The managerial strategy,
conceived by private consultants, is to build performance indicators
capable of inducing the action of public security professionals in a certain
direction . On this point, the profusion of data from some of the large
national and international NGOs and think tanks present in Rio de Janeiro
also seek to create evaluation parameters for public policies, effectiveness
regimes for actions and programs, through performance indicators ,
evaluation and rankings, typical of benchmarking (Bruno; Didier, 2013).

nation. On the other hand, intense mobilizations in civil society are

carried out through numbers, indicators and forms of classification that
strain this standardized readability and punctuate the limits of civil rights
violations.

They are characterized by automation in relation to conventions, escaping

the disputes of a public sphere that becomes opaque, guiding countless

decisions by governments and companies that empty the channels of
democratic deliberation.

counted homicides resulting from police intervention as “productivity” to be

subsidized, thus increasing the lethality of police action during the period

(Cano, 1997). Despite progress, there seems to be a problem not only in

relation to the criteria on which performance indicators rest , but also in the

very use of indicators as government instruments. This is due to the known

problem of gaming (Bevan; Hood, 2006), the strategic game of actors on

such performance indicators and target systems, which seeks to control
and direct their actions. Again, the case of Rio de Janeiro, in this regard, is

exemplary: when police lethality emerged as a public issue, the number of

missing persons began to grow in the same proportion as the number of
“resistance acts” decreased.

In the case of algorithms and benchmarking, both are based on collecting,

Alongside the diffusion of benchmarking, its rankings and
performance evaluations, the metrics of neoliberal governmentality pose
other challenges to the public sphere and to democracy, which have
deserved attention from social scientists. Algorithmic quantification is
found in the application of mathematical models to population
management. In this case, the massive circulation of microdata allows
access to territories, groups, institutions, markets and countries in
fractions of seconds. Automated knowledge emerges from correlations
of non-previously selected, non-hierarchical and highly heterogeneous
serial information , reducing human intervention and dispensing with
hypotheses and conventions about the social world (Rouvroy, 2014). In stark contrast to official statistics, big data

It is no coincidence that social movements have never acted as

much with statistics as they do today, as shown by the strong politicization
of racial categories and the claim to quantify spaces that until recently
were non-commensurable, such as biodiversity, forms of unpaid work ,

the participation in cultural consumption, racial inequality and genderbased
violence. These are domains considered problematic, which are
progressively objectified and constructed by the numbers as public
problems, which makes it possible to transform collective sensibilities in
relation to them, and to give institutional forms to experiences and
aspirations until then fragmented and diffuse, thus contributing directly
to social change.

The contributions gathered here address the production conditions
and modes of use of official statistics and other contemporary forms of
quantifying reality, especially benchmarking and performance evaluation
by indicators and rankings, government devices that retroact on the
actors and affect the constitution of subjectivities. In this reading, it is
interesting to understand statistics as a technology for transferring risk
to individuals, through which non- economic behaviors - such as
criminality, police activity, judicial decisions, family life and social
pathologies - are read by the analytical key of economics, through the
quantification of human activities.
At the same time, another perspective is equally necessary, as
statistics are not and have not always been exclusive weapons of the
powerful, their potential to challenge consensus and re-politicize social
relations remains inexhaustible. Although there is a long tradition of
using statistics to guarantee claims for rights, as in the most explicit case of indexing

aggregation and decentralized analysis of data, in order to model,
anticipate and affect behaviors. This is a distinctive characteristic of
quantification in neoliberalism, which promotes interaction between
social agents and autonomous technologies to make them subjects of
their own observation and classification, monitors of their sociability
(Camargo, 2021).

of salary and cost of living in union demands, some ways of intervening
with numbers are quite recent, specifically aimed at attacking the methods
of domination characteristic of neoliberal governmentality. It is important
here to address the resistance of social movements when resorting to
numbers against institutionalized powers, inequalities and the managerial
management model. Numbers have political uses and are increasingly
problematized and/or disputed, requiring constant epistemological
vigilance over their methods and concepts so that they are not reduced
to mere rhetorical resources in the construction of narratives typical of the
post-modern era. truth and fake news.
In this sense, the dossier intends to debate the transformations of
the State and the modalities of social participation, from the point of view
of their anchorage in public numbers and the political productivity of
statistics, with the aim of uncovering new possibilities for criticizing the
present and governing the present. future. As a starting point, the article
“The social studies of quantification and its implications in sociology”, by
Alexandre de Paiva Rio Camargo and Claudia Daniel, seeks to reconstruct
the origins of the field and its transformations over recent years, drawing
attention to the relationships between the sociology of quantification, the
socio-history of statistics and, to a lesser extent, the anthropology of
numbers. The author's objective is to stimulate a work program through
which sociology should expand its attention to the operations and regimes
of quantification in contemporary societies. And, to demonstrate this
intention, they carry out a broad review of the literature and examine the

contributions accumulated in this literature that directly dialogue with the
central questions of sociology, such as the problem of the foundations of
social order and political authority; the processes of social differentiation
and configuration of subjectivities; critique and transformative social
agency. In the end, there is a call for a research program that, arising
from the sociological method, highlights the effects produced by
quantification devices between different social groups, and reveals the
ways in which power relations operate through the opacity of numbers.

In “The politics of a transformed data landscape: ethnoracial statistics
in Brazil in a regional comparative perspective”, Mara Loveman examines
Brazil's regional protagonism in overcoming the ethno-racial blindness
that characterized Latin American censuses before the turn of the century.
After outlining a historical panorama that reserves a prominent place for
the census in the construction of the scientific-demographic fiction of
whitening, the author addresses the growing politicization of the production of

Stativism is a neologism created by Isabelle Bruno and Emmanuel
Didier to name the growing field of number-based activism practices in
different parts of the world. If, in previous works, the authors sought to
understand, in the wake of thought and joint work with Alain Desrosières,
the specific type of quantification typical of neoliberal government
(Desrosières, 2014), more recently they sought to shed light on how the
different forms of action through numbers punctuate a resistance field. In
the article that makes up this dossier it is quite clear that this opposition
is nuanced in the oppositions and relations between State and society.
Starting their typology of stativism, the authors identify practices that
precede the neoliberal government or are located within it, therefore with
varying critical range, radical or reformist – taking this distinction from Luc
Boltanski. They also show that the circumvention of the rules governing

conduct imposed by the neoliberal government is done through a series
of strategies of resistance to performance indicators , targets and
rankings, typical of benchmarking, as in the case of police officers
subjected to the famous Compstat, part of the project New York's "Zero
Tolerance" They then describe the construction of new collective
categories, such as those associated with the precarious work of artists
and intellectuals in their demands for social and labor rights.
And, finally, alternative public figures are reviewed, as is the case cited
in the quantification of shootings and police operations in Rio de Janeiro,
which make it possible to debate issues that were not previously present.
As the authors say, not without humor, “other numbers are possible”, or
other numbers help to institute other possible ones.

Following this, the article by Samira Bueno, Renato Sérgio de Lima
and Arthur Trindade, “When the State kills: challenges to measure crimes
against life committed by police officers”, highlights in a very clear and
historically situated way the difference and discrepancies between
production of official statistical data and its use as a way of reading the instruments of the

numbers, starting in the 1980s, promoted by the coalition of activists,
social scientists and international organizations, which pressured national
statistical agencies to openly engage in the collection of ethnoracial data.
The Brazilian experience is analyzed in detail as it serves as a model for
other countries in the region, such as Colombia, Bolivia and Chile, where
the composition of forces forged by epistemological and political alignment
did not, however, have the same impact, due to reasons examined in the
article . . Once institutionalized, ethnic-racial classification transformed
politics throughout the region, giving rise to new spaces for the participation
of groups of color, new subjectivities, driven by media campaigns that
encouraged the recognition of African heritage and the consequent change
in self-identification. , and new political demands.
This situation produced new debates and tensions, such as the
discrepancy between official categories, whose scope is considered too
broad, and the objectives of policies to combat inequality, which result in
distortions among beneficiaries. In turn, these tensions stimulate the

outbreak of controversies and reactive subjectivities, which are configured
in opposition to official categorization and emerge with the nationalist
discourse of the new right, which insists on the resubordination of
ethnoracial identities to an atavistic Brazilian identity. In conclusion, the
author proposes a theoretical contribution, an alternative to the image of
the “looping effect” coined by Ian Hacking (1986), when referring to the
recursiveness of statistical classifications on the reality they describe. In
light of transformations in the political field, he suggests the metaphor of a
“spiral effect” to account for the unpredictable consequences of the creation
and ways of using ethnoracial data, which can be both positive and
negative for the objectives of those who produce them.

Natália de Lacerda Gil closes the dossier with the article “ Quality
quantification : some considerations on school failure rates in Brazil”.
Inserting herself in the literature on the role of rankings in the construction
of excellence (Bruno; Didier, 2013; Espeland; Sauder, 2016), the author
questions what is meant by quality in education, implicit in the
methodological choices and procedures for quantifying the school
performance, emphasizing the importance of analyzing the image of
efficiency that the indices seek to measure and promote. To this end,
the article relates the search for the progressive democratization of
elementary schooling to the systematic production of school statistics,
begun in the Vargas Era, when the apprehension of failure started to
present itself as a political-educational problem in the country. Based on
this framework, the formation of a tradition characterized by the
coexistence between the focus on poor school performance of students
and the criticism of high failure rates, repudiated for causing selectivity and exclusion, is examined . Right away,

public action. Reflecting on the way in which homicides committed by
police officers were classified in Brazil, the authors problematize this
interface between statistics and public action, normally taken as selfevident.
To this end, they compare data from the area of public health
and the criminal justice system, whose epistemic bases (medicalepidemiological
and legal-police) guide different taxonomies, neither
completely distinct nor absolutely compatible; highlight the disputes over
nomenclatures and classifications regarding homicides committed by
police officers as part of the political tensions that shape the conflictive
field of the topic; and point out difficulties in constructing equivalences
in the regional, national and international spaces. In the end, the authors
argue, the classifications of homicides committed by police end up
delimiting the field of meanings that the public debate takes, on the one
hand, on the issue of homicides in general, in which the homicides
carried out by police officers, as well as the perverse inversion processes
that make victims of State violence become suspects or culprits.

The works reviewed above and the variety of objects and themes
covered by this dossier demonstrate the potential of quantification studies
to renew theoretical debates and empirical questions that cross different
thematic sociologies, with an emphasis on violence and public security,
ethnic-racial relations, in education and social movements. Without any

pretension to exhaustiveness, we seek to outline the emerging field of
the sociology of quantification, in order to present its main references,
map its emergence and still incipient development in the country, and
relate some concrete problems in contemporary Brazil that become
enriched by this analytical perspective . Possibly, some names and
works were left out of our review, reflecting the dispersed nature of the
field among us, which is why the image of a trail of intellectual production
seems more pertinent to us than that of a map. At the same time, the
dossier reflects and addresses the growing presence of quantification in
Brazilian postgraduate studies, manifested in the volume of works that
have been presented at SBS congresses and ANPOCS meetings.

In an unusual way, the singularly difficult moment that the country is
going through also points in the same direction. The Covid-19 pandemic
that is ravaging the world, reserving an even worse fate for Brazil,
highlights the role of ways of quantifying in the management and
experience of the crisis as a collective experience. Predictive models
aiming at “flattening the curve” (Motta, 2020), case and death figures staggering decisions

New research and young researchers promise to reinforce the vocation
of quantification as a vibrant conversation that crosses different fields,
expanding your toolbox for understanding reality.

the construction of the Basic Education Development Index and its

articulation with the neoliberal policy of maximizing efficiency are
discussed , which shifts the notion of quality as “equity” to the proposition
of quality as “excellence”. The author concludes that the long tradition of
evaluating the quality of teaching by measuring what students know is
maintained at IDEB, which thus amplifies, rather than corrects, the
distortions of a selective and discriminatory school culture.

about lockdown, reopening and isolation, bed occupancy rates in ICUs,
the round numbers punctuating collective mourning are all milestones in
the construction of temporality and the stretching of a present caught
between the radical split with the non-anomalous past and the sky
imaginary of a future without crisis. More than ever, the mobilizing power
of numbers as a common referent and their feedback on social actors stands out.

This picture reveals that public numbers assume a leading role not only
in the structuring dimensions of social life, but also in the most essential
disputes over the political agenda.
We end with a thank you to the authors and to the authors who
agreed to participate in this project. We would also like to thank Jalcione
Almeida, editor-in-chief of Sociologies, for accepting our proposal to
encourage sociological debate in a promising and relevant field, but still
lacking in investigations and spaces for reflection in Brazil. We would like
to thank Victor Alves Mourão, Eugênia Motta and Antônio Paulino for
their interlocutions at different times and their support for initiatives that
helped make this dossier possible. To the anonymous referees who
evaluated the articles, we leave our recognition. And we invite you to
read it, hoping that it inspires disciplinary dialogues.

Likewise, the initial emptying and virtual cancellation of the 2020
census risks plunging the country into obscurantism and ignorance of the
most basic aspects of any population policy. At the same time, the cuts
and dismantling of the census point to the centrality of statistics in the
construction of different forms of inequality – regional, economic, racial,
sexual and gender –, highlighting a fundamental front of the social
struggle. On the one hand, the claim of what should and matters to be
told, made by social movements; on the other, the destruction of the
measure of inequality as a strategy for undermining truth and denying
reality, shared by the new global right.
