The politics of calculation

Towards a sociology of
quantification in governance

Davi
d DEMORTAIN

ABSTRACT
A diversity of modes of quantification in contemporary societies have now been
explored, following the path of scholars who inspired this field, such as Alain
Desrosières. This introduction to the special issue of the Revue d'Anthropologie
des Connaissances on the politics of calculation argues that there remains a gap
between different strains of the sociology of quantification - one that emphasiz
-
es the governmentality it embodies and the discipline it establishes, the other
that pays attention to the collective mobilization capacities it offers. It is sug
-
gested that public policy and governance is a good field of investigation, to
understand how these two “regimes of quantification” are articulated together,
and evaluate the extent to which actors external to the networks that control
public policies can influence them by recalculating both the problems addressed
and the effects of policy programs. Combining the sociology of science and
technology and political sociology, this special issue thus hypothesizes that cal
-
culation is one of the ways of building coalitions in governance, and one of the
objects of what is being debated in its arenas; and, conversely, that governance
is one of the contexts in which contemporary forms of calculation are forged
and algorithms invented.
Keywords: Quantification, calculation, governmentality, Public policy,
governance

INTRODUCTION

The sociology of quantification, specifically the political sociology of it, has
turned into a very rich field of investigation in France, in the path opened by the
duly celebrated work of Alain Desrosières (Didier, 2016). This field, so it seems,
is entering into a phase of maturation and consolidation. The various journal

special issues, edited volumes and literature reviews published in France and
elsewhere testify to this (Bardet & Jany-Catrice, 2010; Bruno et al. 2016; Dagiral
et al. 2016; Diaz-Bone & Didier, 2016; Berman & Hirshman, 2018; Mennicken
& Espeland, 2019). They demonstrate the vitality of research in the field, the
already recurring results and emerging theorizations, as well as the questions
that remain unexplored. Many questions remain, in truth, because of the very
curiosity of the people that publish in the field, and because its still young
research programs — such as that of Espeland and Stevens (2008) — have not
been fully completed yet.
This special issue contributes to the ongoing development of the field. It
builds on the observation that there remains a gap between several parts of the
field, namely between the literature that approached quantification as a mate
-
rial and political rationality; and another literature that prefers emphasizing
that quantification is also a mode of collective action and mobilization. The
project shared by the authors that contributed to the special issue is to look
at quantification in the context of political action towards public policies and
governance, to better assess what political order quantification contributes to
establish in contemporary societies. Public policy analysis and the sociology of
public action, as known in French-speaking sociology and political science, with
its rich analytical language to decipher political games and processes, offer the
possibility, it is assumed, to assess whether quantification is a fixed technology
of government, that reproduces a power structure, or on the contrary a tool
that facilitates political action towards this structure, and its change.

NUMBERS AS A TECHNOLOGY
OF GOVERNMENT

One of the most frequent claims in the sociology of quantification, and
generic result of research in this area of the past two decades, is that numbers
are a technology of government, and that one may “govern by numbers”. That
quantification is the foundation of a capacity to intervene on societies and mar
-
kets, and govern them, is now well understood. Quantification is a generic tech
-
nology of government. Foucault trained us to recognize this, and people have
subsequently confirmed his vision. Nikolas Rose, for instance, was among the
first to explicate how and why “numbers here are an intrinsic part of the mecha
-
nisms for conferring legitimacy on political authority” (Rose, 1991: 673). With Peter
Miller, he argued early on that the political rationalities of government could be
captured by looking at the technologies employed — calculation being one of
them (Rose & Miller, 1992: 175). More recently, in France, Alain Supiot, a legal
scholar specializing in the sociology and history of law, has argued that numbers
have replaced the law, as the main technology of government (Supiot, 2015).
Putting things in numbers, establishing quantitative objective, the continuous

and imperative adjustment of behaviours to numbers, to meet these objectives
– all of this has taken the place of a former mode of government and legitimacy,
based on the negotiated and transparent application of the rule of law.
The notion of a government of or by numbers is rooted in decades of his
-
torical, political and sociological investigation. Research has helped showing,
among other things, that quantification is a form of expertise, hence power. It
is a sort of knowledge that is deemed credible and authoritative. A government
of numbers give power to those professional groups that have the legitimacy
to collect, frame and interpret data, and who master the operations of classi
-
fication, standardization and aggregation by which credible numbers are made.
Those groups contribute to the power of the state — most concretely of large
public bureaucracies (Espeland & Stevens, 2008: 411) — to deploy large appara
-
tuses to collect information systematically about people, territories, and social
and economic life.
Quantification helps govern, because it restricts the frames for expressing
or articulating issues, defining public problems and putting them on the gov
-
ernmental agenda. Quantification constitutes certain phenomena in objects of
government, but gives these phenomena a standardized form. Set categories
and rubrics are established, which serve to produce information in a systematic
way, but restricts the expression of meanings attached to these phenomena. It
circumscribes the possibility to discuss certain issues, and the possibility to rec
-
ognize new problematic situations, until they become tangible in the standard
statistical tables and indicators that the state chooses to follow and monitor.
Quantification, in this regard, is a way to manage unruly publics. It enhances
the governability of societies and social groups, by excluding a wide variety of
local issues and concerns from the set of problems that governments admin
-
ister. The sociologist Ida Hoos, investigating the rise of methods of quantitative
systems analysis in the US government
1
 in the 1970s (Thomas, 2015), deplored
what she called a quantomania, spreading across nearly all sectors of public
administration: “What cannot be counted simply doesn’t count, and so we sys
-
tematically ignore large and important areas of concern. On the other hand,
we sometimes conjure numbers out of assumptions so that we can make cal
-
culations. Once included, they become ‘hard data’, easily to be confused with
‘facts’” (Hoos, 1979: 193)
Much like other technologies of government, indicators, ratios or statis
-
tical tables, are in appearance only technical. They are owned, in fact, by pro
-
fessionals and specialists. They are designed and run “outside the spaces of
democracy” (Lorrain, 2006, p. 429). They remove their moral and ideological
character from the problems addressed, depoliticize them (Ogien, 2013; Rose,
1991). Their use and outputs are imposed onto the governed. They establish a
material, undebatable relationship between them and those who govern (Rose

& Miller, 1992; Lascoumes & Le Galès, 2005). They perform the authority of
the State, as people, collectives or organizations are enrolled into these dis
-
positifs, and abide by the rules of collection of information as well as by the
resulting numbers. For Espeland and Stevens, echoing Foucault, it is for this
reason that one can argue that “Quantitative measures are a key mechanism for
the simplifying, classifying, comparing, and evaluating that is at the heart of disci
-
plinary power” (Espeland & Stevens, 2008: 414).
In more recent literature, this disciplinary effect has been linked with the
authority gained by the ideology of the market. Not that of systems, or that of
risks, but that of the comparative measurement of costs, benefits and efficiency
(Boudia, 2014). Quantification comforts certain logics of government and man
-
agement, the first of which being a logic of managing administration according to
its financial efficiency. Quantification, thus, is closely associated with the expan
-
sion of neoliberal schemes of thought in government (Halpern et al., 2014). This
is an expression of the fact that price, cost and monetary value functions, in
our societies, as the main way of measuring, and of making things commensu
-
rable. It is, one may say, a dominant metric, that has colonized worlds that one
would thought, were incompatible with these criteria and scales. The example
of cost-benefit analysis in environmental matters, is one of the most striking
examples of this redefinition of policies aimed at qualitative, unstructured phe
-
nomena (Kysar, 2010). Healthcare is another blatant example: it has been remodelled
as the product of a “system” by influential health economists (Serré,
2002); a system which one could manage and optimize according to aggregate
levels of demand, supply, cost or price; one in which one could micro-manage
organizations, professionals and patients, so that they conform to what is best
for the system (Juven, 2016).
In sum, the drive to put things in numbers and govern society according to
what agreed-upon numbers indicate, goes unabated. It reaches into more and
more areas of social life, work, and government (Bardet & Jany-Catrice 2010).
Although no unifying logic may be at work, most of what is going on can be
related to a “neoliberal governmentality”, aptly captured by Alain Desrosières:

“The neoliberal state capitalizes on microeconomic market dynamics,
steering them, in part, through systems of incentives, endorsing the central
assumptions of rational expectation theory […] Microeconomic models
allow separating and insolating the specific effects of particular variables
or tools of government on their performances, in view of improving the
target variables, that constitute the true objectives of these incentivebased,
and behaviouralist policies” (Desrosières, 2012: 273).

The disciplining of individuals is effectuated by putting forward quantified
good practices, and appropriate behaviours — benchmarking —, to which
numbers provide natural authority (Bruno & Didier, 2013). Individuals are called
to participate to that discipline, by self-quantifying their actions, and comparing
their numbers with that of others. This neoliberal quantification, in practice,
models behavior (Miller, 1992).

QUANTIFICATION, MOBILIZATION
AND THE RULE OF DEMOCRACY

One question remains, however, concerning the nature of the political order
which quantification comforts or performs. The hypothesis that is most com
-
monly shared today is that the logic of numbers partakes in the expansion of
a market logic, and a neoliberalization of societies and of their government. It
legitimizes and facilitates the institutionalization of financial optimization and its
tools in the government of societies and in public services.
Now, quantification does not necessarily follow the same logic everytime
and everywhere (Dagiral et al., 2015). To fully appreciate the political order that
quantification establishes, and whether numbers are responsible for this alone
(Salais, 2016), one needs to bring into dialogue the literature on the govern
-
ment of numbers, or governmentality, and another, as well-developed literature
on quantification as a mode of collective action and mobilization. According to
the literature review offered by Andrea Mennicken and Wendy Espeland, quan
-
tification is as often studied as a democratic mechanism. It is, in this guise, the
foundation of another quantification regime, distinct from that of the govern
-
ment of numbers. In parallel with the claim that numbers institute a capacity to
govern, and comforts the power of experts and bureaucracies, the sociology of
quantification has come to argue that quantification

“is often driven by the desire to hold to account, to counteract despo
-
tism and arbitrariness, and to make visible social and economic inequality.
Numbers have come to be integral to how democracy is justified and
operationalized as a particular set of mechanisms of rule” (Mennicken &
Espeland, 2019: 224).

Numbers “can also aid social mobilisation and critical debate”, and even repoliticise
issues that had disappeared from the public and governmental
agendas (Kurunmäki et al., 2016: 395). Alain Desrosières, in his time, spoke of
the progressive relation to statistics and public numbers, which he construed
as a “weapon at the service of democracy” (Desrosières 2012: 263), just as
Ted Porter showed through his referential historical study of statistics and
cost-benefit analysis as tools of transparency and trust in the US government
(Porter, 1995).
Mennicken and Espeland refer, to illustrate this regime of quantification, to
the adaptation of statistical apparatuses to make minorities visible, and con
-
tribute to the formation of the political identity of groups labelled minorities
according to large national statistical aggregates (Mora, 2014; Rodríguez-Muñiz,
2017). The social movements that defend quality of life, environmental protec
-
tion or the health of particular groups, often work in a similar fashion, to not
just build stories, but also to generate alternative indicators that might reveal
the extent of the problem. Early illustrations of this are the movement for
alternative social indicators, quantifying human development, gender equality

(or the lack thereof), social progress and quality of life (Land, 1983). But what
students of environmental mobilization have termed “popular epidemiology”
(Brown, 1992) — or how groups of non-professionals and citizens engage in
the production of quantitative knowledge about toxics wastes and associated
diseases — would also qualify, as well as the “social impact assessment” move
-
ment (Freudenburg, 1986).
Mennicken and Espeland formulate several propositions, to advance research
on quantification and democracy and clarify the extent to which people resist
quantification and its discipline, or subvert and appropriate it for other political
enterprises — a question on which the literature remains ambiguous (Bardet &
Jany-Catrice, 2010). The suggestion is to study: “public participation and inclu
-
sion of local knowledge in (uncertain) indicator design, including classification,
measurement, and aggregation”; the development of alternative measures and
counter-quantifications; the role “numbers play in generating and framing public
discussion and deliberations about public goods such as higher education, pov
-
erty, sustainability, migration, incarceration, and health”, and a variety of other
public goods (Mennicken & Espeland, 2019: 232-233).
This program echoes some of the research that has been performed in
France under the banner of “statactivism” (Desrosières, 2012), or the use of
quantification and measurement as a tool for deliberation and emancipation.
The various chapters of the eponymous edited volume (Bruno et al., 2015)
echo what Neveu saw as a radical change in the repertoire of action of social
movements and interest groups (Neveu, 2015) — calling upon numbers, and
the scientific language and the register of facts and objectivity more gener
-
ally — and Ihl an “intensification of scholarly activism” (Ihl, 2004, p. 406). They
also resonate with research on public policies, which demonstrate how public
interest groups and non-governmental organizations, in an international con
-
text, succeed in both gaining a place in the arenas of power, and putting new
issues on the agenda, after quantifying it thanks to creative, and credible, indi
-
cators (Aubert et al., 2016; Gaidet & Fouilleux, 2018; Milet 2005; Revet 2015).
In short, those who fight for the recognition of new problems, do use num
-
bers and indicators (Bezes et al., 2016). Quantification, in this sense, partakes in
the construction of public problems, as Gusfield showed (Gusfield, 1981; Stone,
1989).

BETWEEN GOVERNMENTALITY AND
PLURALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT

The aim of this special issue to advance the combined discussion of govern
-
mentality and collective democratic action through numbers. What exactly is
the relationship between quantification, government and democracy? If quanti
-
fication simultaneously, is a technology of government, and a tool that enables

dominated groups to gain influence over governmental agendas and policies,
how could one characterize its overall political effect? Does quantification par
-
take in the expansion of disciplinary power of existing institutions, or does it
preserve, even augment, pluralism in governance, and the diversity of actors
that wield influence over governmental action?
To date, authors in the field have seldom tried to explicitly combine the
various perspectives of quantification. For Berman and Hirschman, who
offered another review of the whole field of study of quantification (Berman &
Hirschman, 2018), “the sociology of quantification is still very far from having
general claims or a common theoretical language” (Berman & Hirschman, 2018:
258). Mennicken and Espeland are not far from arguing the same thing: the
study of quantification is still fragmented, and lacks the structure of a proper
field of studies. Students of quantification enlist in research about one or the
other regime of quantification — administration being one, democracy another.
The literature on quantification, thus, has not yet produced, or perhaps
tested, whether the aggregate political effect of quantification, so to speak,
pertained to governmentality, discipline and control in the administration of
societies, or to capacities of collective action and democratization. Many of
the seminal authors of the field juxtapose these politics, but do not really tell
readers how they assemble (Rose, 1991; Desrosières, 2014; Bruno et al., 2016).
This may be a result of the inspiration of Michel Foucault, who argued that one
was the other, and vice versa. For Foucault, governmentality is not pure disci
-
pline, or subjection of the individual. Inherent in governmentality is a dialectic
of constraint and capacity. The apparatuses and instruments that materialize
the rationalities of government, both constrain and enable individuals. They “generate strategic stakes, who in turn make the power relationships that they are
supposed to institute, unstable and reversible” (Foucault 1984: 584).
Still, it may be worthwhile investigating quantification, bearing in mind what
each of the spectacles may produce looking at the same object, and trying to
harmonize the picture. Further research is key, first, because new technolo
-
gies of data collection and computation emerge, whose effects are unclear.
Desrosières argued that each technology of quantification corresponds to a
type of state, and a particular historical period. It is well worth perpetuating
this approach, as new technologies emerge, and as politics is becoming, overall,
digitalized (Ogien & Laugier, 2017).
But the main to study government and democracy (or collective action and
mobilization for that matter) by numbers in a combined way, is that the rela
-
tionship between these different contexts or regimes of quantification remain
obscure. To date, it looks like a paradox. Aykut and Nadai (this special issue),
for instance, note that the rising use of predictive models in public policies, can
both be the sign of the endurance of technocracy, or of a new form of reflex
-
ivity and opening of governance. So, if technologies of quantification frame,
silence problems and publics, and thus order governance, what then is the
effect of the resistance to these technologies and, further, of the appropriation

and reinvention of quantification by the governed? To what extent does quan
-
tification change the way in which policies are formed, negotiated and imple
-
mented? How far do interest groups, associations, trade unions, moral entre
-
preneurs, or else, succeed in coproducing public policies, thanks to the political
resource of quantification, data or calculations on them? Is the invention and
use of indicators, ratios, models and calculations by the varied set of actors of
the governance of public problems best approached as a resistance to govern
-
ment, without effect on the rationality of government being deployed and the
structure of established powers? Is it a form of marginal adaptation to the use
of numbers of these powers? Or does it affect the structure of relationships
between these very powers and the actors with which they negotiate policies?

MAKING POLICIES THROUGH
CALCULATIONS

So, in the simplest possible terms, some questions remain about the politics
of quantification: what do numbers change, overall? “When and how do numbers
matter?’ (Berman & Hirschman, 2018: 258). The papers collected here do two
things, to attempt to make strides on this front.
One is to look at quantification in practice and in action, notably at the level
of calculation. Desrosières used to argue that quantifying is agreeing on what to
measure and how, and then measuring (Desrosières & Kott, 2005; Desrosières,
2008a; Desrosières 2012). Despite the usefulness of this phrase to clarify what
quantification means, terms continue to vary from author to author. Various
terms are used interchangeably, or as a litany, including standardizing, normal
-
izing, categorizing, counting, measuring, quantifying, calculating… More and
more often, these terms are organized as a suite of social operations. For
Callon and Muniesa (2003), quantification has as its final step the “extraction
of a result”. Mennicken and Espeland (2019) define a set of three operations
— classification, control and aggregation — of which the third seems to stress
what people do with numbers, putting them into relations, producing new
quantities as a result. Stressing these operations, particularly these final opera
-
tions, means looking into how these are designed and operated, deposited into
what is now commonly called algorithms, seeing the effects of the original num
-
bers that are produced, and thus approaching quantification as a practice, and
form of agency.
The second dimension in this special issue is the policy dimension. Public
policy analysis and governance research in general offers rich, subtle tools to
analyse how problems are governed and administered, and which actors has
power of which part of these processes, overall (Hassenteufel, 2011; Genieys
& Hassenteufel, 2012). Public policy-making and governance is the ideal ground

to investigate the questions described above, and make the departure between
disciplinary and emancipatory effects of calculation.
The study of calculation is inspired by science and technology studies. What
the papers in this special do is to cross-fertilize it with the study of public policy
and governance, assuming that there is a two-way relationship between acting
on and through calculations — elaborating data, infrastructures and algorithms
to produce facts — and the socio-political organization of policy-making actors
(Baumgartner & Jones, 1993).

CALCULATING COALITIONS

What the papers of the special issue have in common, is to show that the
calculations that used in the formulation and implementation of policies are
formed by particular coalitions, which they help form and lend influence to.
The establishment of a database, and design of an algorithm to produce a given
ratio, indicator, or discrete number, are operations through which heterog
-
enous actors assemble and come to act in a coordinated manner. Much like
the advocacy coalitions conceptualized by Sabatier share beliefs (1988), these
groups share assumptions about the virtue of the numbers that they produce,
and of the methods that serve to generate them. They use those to articu
-
late problems, or advocate policies. As just hinted, these coalitions gather het
-
erogeneous actors. They may bring together administrative actors, and other
actors who act outside the administrative sphere. Experts or specialists of
numbers and of their calculation act as brokers, and stabilize the coalition.
In this special issue, Stefan Aykut (Université de Hamburg) and Alain
Nadai (CNRS, Centre International de Recherche sur l’Environnement et le
Développement) deal with the development of models to compute the effects
of choices of energy sources and modes of consumption, as well as the delib
-
eration around energy policy scenarios that these computations support.
Computational models, research has already shown, are not simply helping
to predict situations from the outside of government, and bring numbers on
the table of policy-makers. They are designed and run according to assump
-
tions and visions that betray the modellers’ close involvement in the world
of policy-making, and their ambition to shape policy action (Kieken, 2004). It
is because of this intertwining of modelling and policy, that models and simu
-
lations are somehow performative (van Egmond & Zeiss 2011; Upham et al.,
2015). Public interest groups and associations that contest climate or energy
policies use this means to influence public policies. They can engage in model
-
ling to produce alternative simulations, and make other policy developments
credible. Here, Aykut and Nadai illuminate the historical process by which
models and scenarios for energy policy have diversified over time, owing to the
ties between environmental activists and certain corners of the economics and

of the environmental engineering discipline. They observe the rise of a policy
assemblage, involving these activists, modelers, particular visions of desirable
energy futures, and tools and data to make these visions actually tangible and
debatable.
Sylvain Parasie (Sciences Po) et François Dedieu (INRA, Laboratoire
Interdisciplinaire Sciences Innovations Sociétés) show what citizen measure
-
ment of air pollution owes to the existence of an unlikely coalition, comprised
of the heads of local environmental movements, academics and members of the
state’s environmental protection agency. This coalition is technical, and works
to forge credible and exhaustive measures of air pollution. The coalition helps
to satisfy the necessarily standardized nature of air pollution monitoring (nec
-
essary to create state-level of indicators, and compare the situation of var
-
ious territories), and the need to have in-depth, and meaningful data that doc
-
ument the situation of particular communities and locales. This coalition is also
a political coalition. It helps the state environmental agency deploy the envi
-
ronmental justice policy it has pledged to advance, academic epidemiologists
to work towards health protection, and local activist to defend their people
against the leaders of their county, with whom they are in conflict.
The article authored by David Demortain (INRA, Laboratoire
Interdisciplinaire Sciences Innovations Sociétés) recounts the history of the
development and application of a technique to model the effects of chem
-
ical substances on the human body. This technique of Physiologically-Based
PharmacoKinetics (PBPK) is accused of favouring the interests of the chemical
industry: being designed to replace the safety factors that regulatory agencies
apply to compute safe doses of chemicals, they mechanically lead to increase
these doses of reference. The decisions that regulatory agencies take based on
these models do not appear to confirm this bias. They nonetheless show that
this particular way of computing the doses of chemicals is inseparable from the
rise of a more collaborative mode of governance of chemicals, allowing a direct
and close involvement of businesses and allied scientists in the definition of the
right ways of evaluating chemicals and their risks. The paper also shows that an
alternative modelling technique and algorithm — for quantitative uncertainty
analysis — has taken root in regulatory processes, as regulatory agencies have
coalesced with another family of modelers, more oriented towards the protec
-
tion of public health.
Vincent-Arnaud Chappe (CNRS, CEMS) introduce us to the arcane concep
-
tion of indicators to measure social and gender inequalities within companies.
He focuses on the “rapport de situation comparée”, a form of social reporting that
every business of more than 50 employees in France must produce, to show
the extent of inequalities among its workers. This report comprises a series of
indicators, that have been designed – and negotiated – by the relevant admin
-
istration, trade unions and business associations. Chappe traces the history of
the shifts that trade unions, in coalition with a fringe of academics, either soci
-
ologists or economists, as well as gender activists, have worked to impose to

the gender inequality indicators negotiated in the statutory Conseil supérieur à
l’égalité professionnelle (CSEP). In so doing, he shows how trade unions, at the
centre of this coalition, gain a capacity to work within the constraints of the
exiting legal and statistical infrastructure, employing existing categories and
data to compute numbers that are more likely to reveal inequalities.
Mehdi Arrignon (AgroParisTech, Laboratoire PACTE) closely investigates
the way in which the French Commissionner for social affairs, during the pres
-
idency of Nicolas Sarkozy, set out to employ the method of the randomized
clinical trial of economists, to produce the evidence of the efficiency of an inno
-
vative but contentious reform – the introduction of incentive-based system of
social benefits for unemployed (Revenu de Solidarité Active). Against a purely tac
-
tical reading, Arrignon shows that the Commissionner and his advisers have
teamed with economists in a genuine attempt to apply this standard method,
convinced as they were that it would prove its efficiency. The policy reform,
in this respect, is inseparable from the credibility of the method, and the pro
-
visional, yet effective coalition that it gave birth to, linking the Commission
and his advisers to renowned economists and other elected officials (heads of
French conseil généraux), on which the experiment depended.

POLICY ARENAS AND THE
EVALUATION OF NUMBERS

One final theme emerges from the contributions to the issue: each of them
shows in their own ways, that the evaluation of numbers and of underlying for
-
mulas, are a central element of the politics of policy-making. To put it simply,
numbers and formulas are seldom accepted as such, but trialed, deconstructed
and debated, often publicly (Andrews et al., 2017; Crawford, 2016).
Aykut and Nadai put at the heart of their history the particular, provisional
policy arena of the Debat National sur la Transition Energétique. This arena, in
fact, is almost defined by the existence of an ecology of models and scenarios.
The comparison and confrontation of these models is the raison d’être of the
debate, the very institutional motivation to establish it, and its way of working.
At the heart of the deliberation taking place on this stage, one finds the minute
examination of models, assumptions, parameters, and strength of their resulting
numbers. In Parasie and Dedieu’s case, local arenas, including local media
arenas, play an essential role. Official measurements of air pollution are trialled
there, accused of overlooking localized pollutions and the problematic levels of
exposure of particular groups and neighbourhoods. In Demortain’s case, calcu
-
lations appear to be put in debate in a variety of interconnected public arenas
– the national academies, the press, the judiciary, which open to the various
voices that support or contest the numbers and algorithms on which decisions
rest. The paper by Chappe is also a direct illustration of the joint political life

of calculation and of arenas: his is a story of the negotiation surrounding indi
-
cators that trade unions and their allies have manufactured for the arena of the
CSEP, in which they will get tested, perhaps endorsed. In the work of Arrignon,
numbers and calculations get debated and judged in the parliamentary arena,
among others, at this crucial moment where the Commissionner introduces
the results of the experimentation to members of parliament hastened to vote
his reform.
Calculation, at the end of the day, does appear to be a mode of action on
policies, and an integral component of the repertoire of a set of actors that
engage with these policies — as much as a technology of government. It has
become, too, one of the normal materials of the politics of policy-making. So,
calculation is not necessarily a fixed instrument, reproducing the structure of
powers and the relationship between governing actors and those governed.
It would obviously be exaggerated to argue that, with quantification and cal
-
culative operations, come a full pluralization of governance, and the rise of
the influence of actors that are peripheral to the policy sub-systems that usu
-
ally control them. In truth, the papers that are brought together here call
for nuance: the appearance of coalitions and of new ways of calculating pollu
-
tion, inequality, chemical risks, or energy futures or rates of return to work
of unemployed people, takes place during moments of reform of the policies
in question. Though we are far from configurations of outright policy crises
(Dobry, 1986), all of the policies surveyed here are fluid, and the systems taking
care of them, partly open to external influences. The pluralization of numbers
and algorithms that is observed in the various papers, probably has to do with
these contexts of change. But then again, it is useful to think about calculation
and policy as being in a recursive relationship: the perceived possibility to quan
-
tify things differently, or quantify other things, spur action, which in turn con
-
tributes to destabilize policies, and keep windows of change open. The extent
to which the numbers and algorithms that are suggested during this moment,
win the day and institutionalize into a material system, complete with its cate
-
gories, procedures of data collection, cadres of statisticians and calculators, is
a further question that, from the perspective advocated here, would be well
worth investigating.

MOBILIZING THE EXPERTISE AND
INFRASTRUCTURES OF CALCULATION

Each of the contributions shows, in a sociological coproductionist perspec
-
tive as it were (Jasanoff 2004), that ways of calculating and the social organiza
-
tion of policy formulation, mutually influence each other. New forms of calcu
-
lation and new computations about public issues, help replace certain actors at

the centre of the political space in which policies are formed, thanks to the alli
-
ance that these numbers help form.
This comes in contrast with governmentality studies, that broadly show
how the expertise of numbers and calculations, replace the authority of those
who were in charge, inside public administration, of the quantification of issues.
Desrosières was specifically worried that, under an era of neoliberal govern
-
mentality, the cadres of public statisticians and economists would be replaced
by the specialists of benchmarking and rankings (Desrosières, 2012; 2014). A
similar concern emerges today, as the digitalization of many aspects of life, and
the capture of data by large commercial platforms, displaces power from public
experts of statistics, to faceless computers of personal data (Davies, 2017).
There are unmistakable signs of this trend in various areas of governmental
work and public services. The production of new numbers, and predictions,
thanks to more numerous and more fine-grained sets of data, help private
experts enter into areas of public action where they were absent. Under the
banner of data science, new types of experts are thus entering legal systems and
policing (Christin, 2017; Benbouzid, 2019). As administrations consult new kinds
of data providers and modelers, the professional groups and experts in place
can be severely challenged, or displaced outright (Angeletti, 2011, Henriksen,
2013).
The papers included in this issue do not directly address the issue of the
redistribution of expert power linked to the emergence of new types of infor
-
mation and analytical technologies, but one can infer from these studies that
the rotation among experts may be less dramatic. They show, collectively, that
there remains a degree of fluidity in the ways of putting policy issues in num
-
bers, and that calculatory expertise is in some sense distributed. Different
actors work to produce and validate numbers, from within administration or
outside. What is observed in this handful of cases is less the replacement of a
professional group by another, and the displacement of the statistics produced
by public administrations by private producers of data, than a reconfiguration
of the alliances between actors that offer numbers, and others. These recon
-
figurations are facilitated by the contexts of reform and change in policies. The
movement goes both ways: these coalitions are enabled by new numbers and
methods to compute them; in turn, they make these ways of producing num
-
bers evolve.
The fact that coalitions and arenas of calculation emerge is still puzzling,
however, given the materiality and stability of the infrastructures that produce
the data that actors who wish to calculate, need. Quantification is a form of
governmentality because it rests on material infrastructures and on the stan
-
dards that command the production of formatted, homogenous data (Espeland
& Stevens, 1998). Those infrastructures constitute a good part of the discipline
that Foucault wrote about. They modify people, places and things. They require
their participation, or even “complicity” (Espeland & Stevens, 1998, p. 331).
They constitute people as agents of data systems, and make them governable.

They allow states and firms to produce decisions routinely, about these people.
They are most of the time invisible, even if they require immense, continuous
coordination work to be established and function (Bowker & Star, 1999).
Each of these motives — legitimacy, functionnality, coordination costs —
explain why informational and data infrastructures can not multiply, or be easily
altered to quantify something else. This simple fact is a barrier to the emer
-
gence of coalitions defined by alternative ways of counting and calculating. The
papers in the issue provide an important element of explanation, for how coali
-
tions nonetheless emerge, and calculation gain in diversity. It relates to what
one may term the accretion of infrastructures. The coalition and alliances that
are observed here do not solely contest existing infrastructures, or construct
alternative databases, using new categories and standards. They plug on existing
infrastructures, and deviate them. They use these as much as possible, observe
their limits, and find ways of completing the infrastructure. They add param
-
eters, informational items, or most importantly, develop formulas to produce
new results based on the same data. Aykut and Nadai are most explicit about
this dimension, when they show that new models and scenarios develop on
the basis of the limits of former models, and because existing infrastructures
allow new types of data to emerge – namely, energy consumption data (see
also Aykut, 2019). Parasie and Dedieu speak about the politics of calibration,
to show how the existence of other data, and associated collectives, is due to
their capacity to align on the existing, official infrastructure, and apply the stan
-
dards of measurement that define it. In Demortain’s case, PBPK models, as
an alternative mode of computing hazards and doses of chemicals, only exist
because of the underlying sets of data produced through animal experiments.
Models are data models in the first place, and could not exist without this vast
infrastructure for standardized animal experimentation, that modellers none
-
theless criticize and aim to replace. Chappe, finally, is very explicit on this very
point of the connection to existing infrastructures. The action of trade unions
and their allies only makes sense because they are legitimate users of the data
produced by businesses, and are able to recompute them.
So, the discipline of quantification has its legitimacy. This legitimacy is linked
to the capacity to commensurate things, and produce objective measures of
things that are alike. One cannot easily counter-quantify without risking to
be illegitimate, and less objective. Acting through calculation to shape policies
does not involve the contestation of existing categories, data and standardized
infrastructures in place, but help them grow and evolve, from within. There
are margins of maneuver inside infrastructures, and calculations using already
existing data, by actors who have access to these even though they don’t own
the infrastructure, only accentuates and exploits these.
