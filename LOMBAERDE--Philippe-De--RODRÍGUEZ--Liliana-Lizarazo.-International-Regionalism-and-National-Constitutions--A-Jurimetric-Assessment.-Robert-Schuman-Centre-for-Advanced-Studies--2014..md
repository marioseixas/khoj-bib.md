The Global Governance Programme at the EUI

The Global Governance Programme (GGP) is research turned into action. It provides a European
setting to conduct research at the highest level and promote synergies between the worlds of research
and policy-making, to generate ideas and identify creative and innovative solutions to global
challenges.

The GGP comprises three core dimensions: research, policy and training. Diverse global governance
issues are investigated in research strands and projects coordinated by senior scholars, both from the
EUI and from other internationally recognized top institutions. The policy dimension is developed
throughout the programme, but is highlighted in the GGP High-Level Policy Seminars, which bring
together policy-makers and academics at the highest level to discuss issues of current global
importance.The Academy of Global Governance (AGG) is a unique executive training programme
where theory and “real world” experience meet. Young executives, policy makers, diplomats,
officials, private sector professionals and junior academics, have the opportunity to meet, share views
and debate with leading academics, top-level officials, heads of international organisations and senior
executives, on topical issues relating to governance.

Abstract

This paper considers a large global sample of constitutional texts (i.e. 171 constitutions from 153
countries) and assesses to what extent and how they refer to the increasingly important phenomenon of
international regionalism (or regional integration) and how they deal with potential sources of tensions
and contradictions between the national legal systems and the emerging regional regulatory universes.
A typology of clauses is therefore proposed. In addition, some evidence is presented on the evolution
of constitutional references over time, and on the relationship between constitutional referencing and
the depth of the (de facto and de jure) regionalization processes.

1. Introduction*

International regionalism has gained considerable importance since WWII and there are good reasons
to think that this tendency of deepening regionalism might well continue in the foreseeable future (de
Melo and Panagariya 1995; UNCTAD 2007; Kühnhardt 2010).
1 No doubt there are many cross-border
policy challenges for which the regional level might well be the most adequate to tackle them,
especially if the responses to these challenges show features of regional public goods (Sandler 1998).
Just think of migration (and related social security issues), infectious diseases, large infrastructure
works, natural resource management, environmental disaster management, consumer protection,
economic crisis management, monetary stabilization, etc.

Such a process of gradual deepening of regional integration or regionalism implies, however, that
the institutional and legal nature of the arrangements is also being transformed.2
From a legal
perspective, it is recognized that a new form of globalization of the law (called ‘the third
globalization’) is taking place, characterized by institutional innovations such as structural adjustment,
economic integration and the generalized protection of human rights. These phenomena have
influenced the displacement of legal positivism by other normative legal schools such as NeoConstitutionalism
in Europe and Legal Pragmatism in the US, which seem more compatible with these
new phenomena (Kennedy 2006:64; Posner 2004:157-9; Bomhoff 2008:4).

From a situation of pure treaty-based intergovernmental cooperation, which can be handled with
the established instruments and practices of international public law, states may move in the direction
of deeper forms of integration which imply less policy autonomy and/or the pooling or transfer of
sovereignty. With deeper integration, the paradigms of the formal international public law and the
capacity of national constitutions to interact with it, are being tested.

The purpose of this Paper is double. On the one hand, it is related to ontological and typological
issues, as a first step in theorizing. We aim at describing how and to what extent constitutional texts,
drawn from a large global sample of constitutions, actually refer to the phenomenon of international
regionalism (or regional integration). In other words, the questions that will be addressed are about the
extent to which constituents and legislators worldwide refer in their constitutions to the emerging
reality of regionalism and deal explicitly with potential sources of tensions and contradictions between
the national legal systems and the emerging regional regulatory universes. We will thereby propose a
typology of clauses, which –we claim- will be useful for both legal and political-type analyses, and
apply a jurimetrics approach. This will already give an initial idea of the extent to which national
constitutions deal with potential sources of tensions and contradictions between the national legal
systems and the (existing or emerging) regional regulatory universes. On the other hand, we will
present exploratory analytical work, showing some evidence on the evolution of constitutional
references over time, and on the relationship between constitutional referencing and the depth of (de
jure and de facto) regionalization processes.

The structure of the paper is as follows: we will first present a literature review in section two. This
includes the connection with the ontological and conceptual discussions in the field (2.1), and the
connection with the literature on the transformation of international public law in the context of

In this paper, regionalism, regional governance or regional integration refer to international regions, as distinguished
from sub-national regions (or cross-border regions). In the literature these regions are also called macro-regions or
supranational regions. The latter term (supranationality) is reserved here to refer to the nature of arrangements (i.e. not
regarding membership), as distinguished from intergovernmental arrangements.

regional integration (2.2); Section three deals with various aspects of our empirical methodology
(research questions, selection of constitutions, selection of relevant clauses, typology, indicators, etc.).
In section four, we present the results in terms of frequency and typology of constitutional referencing
to the regional phenomenon. The jurimetric results are contextualized and re-connected to the regional
and national constitutional and institutional contexts. Section four thus responds to the first purpose of
this paper (see above). Section five presents some further analysis and interpretation of the data. Using
a sub-sample of constitutions, some evidence will be presented on the evolution of constitutional
referencing over time, and on the relationship between constitutional referencing, on the one hand, and
de jure or de facto depth of the regionalization process, on the other. Section six concludes.

2. Literature review

2.1. International regionalism

The broader political science/IR literature on regionalism is characterized by conceptual variety, if not
conceptual confusion (see Hurrell 1995; Katzenstein 1996; Mansfield and Milner 1997; WarleighLack
2008; Sbragia 2008; De Lombaerde et al. 2010; and many others). This variety reflects both the
heterogeneity of the underlying population of regions (Genna and De Lombaerde 2010), and the fact
that regions (and regionalization processes) can be looked at through a variety of theoretical lenses.
We cannot go deeply into this conceptual debate here, but what comes clearly out of it is that
comparative studies on regionalism require ab initio conceptual pluralism and flexibility. This will
also be our underlying approach when selecting relevant clauses from a sample of constitutions (see
below).

Regionalism will therefore be seen here as a phenomenon going beyond regional intergovernmental
and supranational organizations. Having said this, from institutional and legal perspectives they are
obviously of essential relevance. From a transaction cost perspective, one could assimilate
intergovernmentalism with the organization of a market of international relations, whereas
supranational integration could then be assimilated with the creation of an organization (Trachtman
1996: 48). They are usually seen as discrete, mutually excluding and opposite extremes but it is closer
to reality to consider more gradual transformations within a spectrum (Weiler 1991) and -more
recently- they have been considered as rather complementary options for regional integration (Schout
and Wolff 2010:1-2). Supranationality is usually understood as a vertical transfer of competences to
supra-national institutions, i.e. a hierarchical institutional design, while intergovernmental schemes are
more based on horizontal cooperation. One illustration of the complementarity hypothesis is the
European Union (EU), considered as the cornerstone of the supranational model, which continues to
deepen its regional integration process increasingly using intergovernmentalist arrangements for this
purpose (Fontes 2000:6; Schout and Wolff 2010: 18).

But even from a legal perspective, regionalism is not only a matter of (regional) intergovernmental
treaties and/or supranational organizations; it is also –more generally- one of the factors that contribute
to the transformation of international law (see also below) and to the consequential changing nature of
national sovereignty regarding the regulation of the internal affairs of countries. When looking at these
developments, the EU is usually taken as the main point of reference, given that its regional
integration process has created an important corpus of supranational law and institutions and
simultaneously reduced national sovereign competences of its member states. However, when looking
at regionalism globally, although one can observe a renewed dynamism since the 1990s (the so-called
new regionalism) in many regions, one cannot observe a systematic adoption of the ‘European model’,
understood as the formal model of European supranationalism, elsewhere (Best 2005: 39; De
Lombaerde and Schulz 2009). ASEAN for instance rejected the creation of regional supranational
institutions. By contrast, the African Union has taken the European Model more into account but not
reaching a representative level of supra-nationalism and de facto being more inclined towards

intergovernmental designs (Best 2005:40-1). This is reflected in our empirical analysis where, behind
the European countries, the countries of the African region are the ones who have most explicit
references to belonging to regional organizations in their constitutional texts (e.g. Algeria, Angola,
Cape Verde and DR Congo) (see section 3). Also in Latin America, there is some formal similarity
between the regional institutions and the European institutions (the Andean Community being a case
in point), but despite the intentions, intergovernmentalism is still predominant. There is an extensive
literature on the ‘European model’ (in its normative and positive understandings) and the
comparability of regionalization processes in political science/IR.3 This will not be further discussed
here; in this paper, we will focus on the legal aspects that interact with regional integration policies
worldwide.

Regional integration can be considered as public international (economic) law whose scope has
sometimes been interpreted as a new form of governing competition among states with respect to the
regulation of all issues related with international trade, but more in particular, with public goods. This
regulation of competition at the international level seeks therefore to achieve local public policy goals
of national governments (Trachtman1996: 50-1).

But regionalism has also been presented as weakening the unitary sovereignty of the nation state
and the traditional hierarchy of legal rules (Bernard 2011). According to Trachtman (1996: 57-58), the
degree of regional integration has a direct relation with the scope of constitutional competences of the
legislative branch of government. If they are expanded, governments would engage more with
intergovernmental organizations. The scope of the national constitutional judicial competences may
also influence the discussion concerning supranational rules. Therefore, constitutional design is
relevant for the deepening of regional integration processes, when transiting from an
intergovernmental arrangement towards an institutionalized supranational organization.

2.2. Regional integration, international public law and constitutional law

The discussion on constitutional referencing to regionalism or regional integration should be seen in
the broader context of a global transformation of international public law and constitutional law.
Relevant aspects of this transformation include: the constitutionalization of international public law,
the debate about the enforcement of international treaties by national authorities, and the growing
relevance of international soft law. These will be briefly presented in the following paragraphs.

The constitutionalization of international public law4

An empirical study of national constitutions and case law concluded that although the influence of
international law on national constitutional systems is significant, constitutional courts do not
necessarily uphold the supremacy of international law over national constitutions (Peters 2009:171).
However, although this appears to be a problem of hierarchy of rules and although it sometimes seems
that international law and national constitutions are irreconcilable, there is a clear trend towards a
progressive harmonization of national constitutions worldwide, mainly in the terrain of human rights
(Peters 2009:197).

Modern constitutions, enacted after 1945, generally protect fundamental rights, based on “a flexible
and pragmatic style of interpretation and enforcement” which seems closer to the German model
(Grey 2003:7). This model has been widely adopted in countries with recent democracies and is

This concept has been widely analyzed, and it is also referred to as world constitutionalism (Ackerman 1997; Peters
2012). The idea behind these concepts is that some issues regulated by public international law enjoy a sufficient degree
of ‘objectivity’ that they may limit the sovereignty of the nation–state and even of international organizations (Kleinlein
2012:703).

becoming the most influential model outside the US (Ginsburg 2008). In the US, the scope of foreign
and international law, case law or doctrine has been frequently debated. Some positions argue that
globalization and the diffusion of the protection of human rights have an incidence on US
constitutional cases, while other oppose this possibility because it is not in line with the meaning of the
US constitution (Gray 2007: 5-6, 11-5). That is why world constitutionalism is not considered as
having a strong influence on US constitutionalism (Ackerman 1997:772).

At the global level, a progressive constitutionalization of international public law has been
suggested, precisely because of the progressive weakening of national constitutions caused by the
growing globalization of some issues. This is mainly supported and promoted by courts and the
academic world (Peters 2012:82). The points of departure for this global constitutionalism are two
international legal systems in force: the international protection of human rights and the WTO (Peters
2012). These legal systems are more and more interconnected (Van Hees 2004; De Lombaerde and
Lizarazo 2013; Lizarazo et al. 2014).

The protection of fundamental rights and their consequent judicial globalization is characterized by
the mutual citation in human rights matters, named the “new ius gentium of human rights” (Grey
2003:7; Stone Sweet and Matthews 2008; Bomhoff 2008). This movement is seen as the conclusion of
a long process of increasing pertinence of rights, in many cases taking the form of rules and in other
cases as policies, but their relevance cannot be ignored, even if they are not part of the constitution
(Kennedy 2006:65-6). The growing direct application of International Conventions of Human Rights
as binding rules by national courts corroborates this trend (ICJ 2008).

The WTO in turn is presented as an example of a strong global institution that aims to fight
protectionism through the principles of most favored nation (MFN) and national treatment (Peters et
al. 2011: 71-6). However, the stagnation of the Doha Development Agenda in recent years, similarly
to what happened during the Uruguay Round, has affected its global influence through the explosion
of bilateral and regional FTAs. It is argued that the recently approved Bali Package in 2013 (just)
seeks to recover the role of the WTO as the main regulator of international trade (Ramírez 2013). In
addition, the constitutionalization of international economic law is also justified by the need to solve
the conflicting relations between human rights protection and trade liberalization with the
corresponding creation of a multilevel judiciary (Peters et al. 2011: 76-7, 94; Van Hees 2004; Narula
2011).

Treaty enforcement by national authorities

Although the debate on the scope of self-executing treaties versus non-self-executing treaties is to a
large extent associated with the US, its relevance goes beyond this country and extends particularly to
other federal states in processes of international integration. The concept of self-executing treaties
refers to the possibility that an international treaty may be directly enforced before courts without the
implementation of prior legislation (Vázquez 1995: 695). This subject remains highly controversial
and the US Supreme Court of Justice has not produced a clear precedent that would guide lower courts
in distinguishing between self-executing treaties and non-self-executing treaties (Vázquez 1995: 722-
3; García 2013). A non-generalized position in case law supports the presumption of non-selfexecution,
mainly in the context of multilateral treaties (Bradley 2003:1588-9). Another interpretation,
seeking to apply a more selective filter to the direct application of international treaties, affirms that if
a treaty creates a “primary international duty”, it is judicially enforceable but the nature of the duty is
also relevant. Courts should determine whether this international duty creates a primary national duty
whose nature and scope is a constitutional issue and whether the national duty is judicially
enforceable. However, this extreme position limits the enforcement of treaties by the courts when the
political branches decide not to comply with them (Sloss 2002). In recent years, the US Supreme
Court has influenced the way of understanding self-executing-treaties after a ruling of 2008 (Medellín
vs. Texas). Since then, it is accepted that treaties have a double character of political and legal
International Regionalism and National Constitutions: A Jurimetric Assessment

agreements whose judicial enforcement may also be considered as a political decision, or as a
discretionary decision of courts that may be controlled by the political branches (Bradley 2009:41-2).5

In Europe this issue has also been analyzed. Poland, The Netherlands and Germany are quoted as
countries remarkably inclined towards accepting the character of some treaties as self-executing, in
particular those that refer to rights enforcement (Sloss 2009:12-3). The existence of the EU legal
system is one reason that may explain why some national courts in some European countries are more
familiar with the character of self-executing treaties (Sloss 2009:15).

In some of the more visible countries belonging to the Commonwealth, such as Australia, Canada
and the UK, the courts are in general open to accept the self-executing character of some treaty
clauses, also mainly when they relate to rights. In the UK the Human Rights Act (1998) is at the basis
of this position while Canada accepts the direct enforcement of treaties by the application of “the
presumption of conformity” and in Australia the “legitimate expectations doctrine” is the basis of this
acceptance (Sloss 2009:24).

Recent judicial activism of some courts is attracting the attention to emerging markets where the
international treaties of human rights are not only self-executing, but they are also used as a binding
principle of constitutional adjudication. This is the case of India and South Africa (Sloss 2009:25) but
also Colombia (Lizarazo 2011; Lizarazo et al. 2014).

Trade agreements and regional economic integration

Concerning international trade agreements, the US Constitution does not establish their character of
self-executing treaties approved under the competence of the commerce clause, and case law of the US
Supreme Court of Justice does not show a clear pattern. Case law of the US Court has not been
consistent in the interpretation of the scope of the commerce clause although it has ruled that one of its
purposes is the abolition of the barriers to trade (Goodman and Frost 2000:1,3,5). Therefore, regional
integration treaties signed by the US, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
are not clearly self-executing treaties. The Congress has the competence to overrule them. As such,
regional integration agreements need special constitutional status to warrant more institutional stability
(Abbot 1993: 184). In some cases, the Court follows policy arguments in favor or against the
(federated) states, and in some cases it has considered NAFTA as a threat to national sovereignty
(Goodman and Frost 2000: 1, 3, 5). The US states are concerned that their constitutional competences
may be compromised by the federal government because it does not have a binding duty to consult
with the states during the negotiation of trade agreements, although the NAFTA itself includes a duty
to align state competences with NAFTA regulations (Tangeman 1996: 245-6). Again the issue turns
around the nature of “constitutional state rights” with a political component. While for some observers
the constitutional sovereignty of states is an obstacle in the processes of FTA negotiations (Goodman
and Frost 2000:1), for others the federal government cannot compromise the constitutional sovereignty
of the states, otherwise the Federal level would widen its competences (Cruz 2014: 102-3, 105). But
the issue is not exclusive to the US. In Canada, some tensions between NAFTA regulations and
provincial policies have been observed in the areas of environmental protection and investment
(Cumming and Froehlich 2007).

In Australia, it has been proposed that the problem of federal states regarding the competences of
subnational entities in the context of regional agreements be solved by means of the action of the
constitutional court by balancing (reconciling) (protectionist) sub-national constitutional competences
with federal constitutional competences on free trade (Villalta 2011:1,18). By contrast, as it will be
illustrated in the empirical analysis of constitutions, European countries with strong federal states such
as Germany, Italy and Austria are solving the conflict between levels of government by constitutional

regulation of multi-level governance, seeking to avoid regulatory obstacles to the regional integration
process as in North America or Australia.

At the European level, the development of European integration and the self-executing character of
most of the hard European Law have been possible because national constitutions have been made
compatible with (the primacy of) European Law (Declaration 17 annexed to the TEU, quoted by
Besselink et al 2014:9). The principle of primacy, together with the one of the direct effect of
European Law have been developed by the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU), and
they have been considered as the point of departure of a progressive constitutionalization of the
primary Law of the EU (Aguilar 2012:7-8).6

Although in principle the primacy of EU law could be seen as an expression of the Vienna
Convention of 1969 (27), which does not allow member-states to invoke national rules as a
justification to breach treaties, the relations between EU law and national constitutions of memberstates
have been largely analyzed in a very specific way. They have even been considered as a sort of
composite constitutional framework or an “interwined constitutionalism” (Ziller 2005:480, quoted by
Diez-Hochleitner 2013: 3-4).

This compatibility has been made possible mainly through constitutional amendments that
authorize the limitation of national sovereignty and/or the consequent transfer of competences to the
EU. In many countries, the objective to participate in the EU as a regional integration process was
made explicit in the corresponding constitutional amendment by means of the enactment of the wellknown
“Europa Clauses” (Besselink et al. 2014:8-21) or “integration clauses” (Bernard 2011). This
explains why many EU member states include explicit references to the regional grouping in their
constitutional texts (see table 3).7

However, ‘good’ European governance in coordination with the national competences of the
member-states depends not only on constitutional and legal regulators who support regional
integration mainly by the elimination of constitutional barriers (“constitutional safeguards”) but also
on the behavior of courts, who can/should also ensure international cooperation by avoiding “the
protection biases” that may affect regional integration. In other words, regional integration law needs
to be enforced with the support of a multilevel judicial safeguard who should take into account the
constitutional diversity of the member-states (Petersmann 2008: 246).8 Therefore, the enforcement of
EU law depends on a strong coordination between EU Law and national constitutional systems,
favoring the interpretation pro unione of constitutional rules, in particular the “Europe clauses” (DiezHochleitner
2013:4), but at the same time, national constitutional values should be a criterion of
interpretation for the CJEU.9

Thus, as Besselink et al. (2014: 22-27) explain, although from the perspective of the EU
institutions, national constitutions cannot be used as an argument to refuse the enforcement of EU
Law, from the perspective of member-states, secondary EU Law is enforceable if it respects


6
The first principle refers to the prevalence of EU Law in case of contradiction with national legal rules of the memberstates,
and the second one refers to the above defined self-executing treaties (Aguilar 2012:7-8).
7
The relevant role of national constitutions for the enlargement of the European integration has been particularly notorious
in the case of East European countries where deep constitutional reforms were needed in order to make their national
legal order compatible with EU law (Herdegen 2013:144).
8
Although the creation of supranational institutions, including Courts, has been presented as the best way to promote
regionalism, the “multilevel legal and judicial protection” of regional markets may also occur by means of
intergovernmental designs as in the case of the Economic European Area (EEA) (Petersmann 2008: 235-236).
9
This position has as legal basis the TEU (4.2) which holds that “The Union shall respect the equality of Member States
before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and
constitutional, inclusive of regional and local self-government. It shall respect their essential State functions, including
ensuring the territorial integrity of the State, maintaining law and order and safeguarding national security. In
particular, national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State”.

constitutional rights, the limits of the transferred competences to the EU and the constitutional
principles (also called “national identity”). These conditions coincide with the TEU (4.2) but they have
also been identified in case law of national courts (e.g. Germany, Denmark) and in some national
constitutions (e.g. Germany (23) and Portugal (7(6))).10

The case of Germany is a benchmark case inside the EU and the German Constitutional Court has
extensively ruled on the scope of delegation of competences to the EU. Initially the discussion was
mainly about the level of protection of German constitutional rights. The German Court has in general
upheld EU law if the EU reveals at least the same level of protection of fundamental rights provided
by the German Constitution (Pernice 1998; Lebeck 2006). However, since the enactment of the Treaty
of Lisbon, which gave binding force to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the tensions
concerning constitutional rights have diminished (Besselink et al. 2014). Some authors argue that the
German Constitutional Court is also inclined to be in line with the CJEU because European integration
is a German constitutional value (Lebeck 2006; Diez-Hochleitner 2013; Paulus 2009: 241; Besselink
et al 2014: 19). Nevertheless, the respect for fundamental constitutional principles by EU law (which
in some cases still includes rights concerns) remains a relevant issue in national courts (Besselink et al.
2014: 22-5).

As far as the respect for the transfer of competences is concerned, the German Constitutional Court
accepts that the CJEU verifies first whether the EU respects its own competences, and it would only
rule in cases of notorious detriment of national competences (Besselink et al. 2014: 222).11 This is, the
conflict becomes real only after a ruling of the CJEU by means of the proceedings for annulment or by
a preliminary ruling (Diez-Hochleitner 2013:33) .

This issue (known as the ultra vires control) remains the main source of potential conflict between
EU law and national constitutions, despite the fact that the TEU (4.1 and 5.2) establishes that all
“competences not conferred upon the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States”. The
problem is that the Lisbon Treaty does not contain a clear catalogue that would avoid potential
conflicts (e.g. art. 114) (Diez Hochleitner 2013: 7,9). The main concern of the German Court when
analyzing the constitutionality of the Lisbon Treaty (Lisbon Case) referred mainly to the flexibility
clause (TFEU (352)), which allows that the EU competences may be adjusted to the objectives of the
Treaty in case it fails in providing the necessary competences to reach them. The German Court held
that EU law and the competences of the CJEU should respect and protect the democratic principle12
,
i.e. each new transfer of competences should be approved by national parliaments and not only by the
European Parliament. This position has been seen as a rejection of the creation of a European federal
state (Kiiver 2010:580-3; Diez Hochleitner 2013:14; Wolfahrt 2009:1280).

In Africa, the constitutional rules and case law of African states in general are currently not in a
state of accommodating supranational rules to support the further deepening of regional integration.
Some countries reformed their constitutions after independence to favor regional integration.
However, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) emphasized the national sovereignty of the
member states and the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, which is not necessarily
compatible with a deepening process of regional integration (Oppong 2008: 2,15). More recently, i.e.


10 Cf. infra, the principle of subsidiarity in France, Germany and Portugal.
11 The Lisbon case has been seen by some as showing a Euro-skeptic position of the German Constitutional Court because
it keeps the competence of revising ultra vires acts of the EU (Diez Hochleitner 2013: 7). However, the German Court
upheld the treaty and even made the ultra vires control compatible with the Europe clause (BL 23 (13-4)), seeking not to
interfere with the normal activity of the EU (Diez Hochleitner 2013:13).
12 The respect of the democratic principle (i.e. the approval of international agreements by national parliaments) is not an
exclusive position of the German Court. It is understood as the way to legitimize the international economic order
(Herdegen 2013:67). Bothe (2009) considers this case law of the German Court not necessarily as an obstacle to regional
integration but as useful and necessary for Europe because the active participation of Parliaments in daily issues of
European policy would shorten the distance between EU institutions and EU citizens.

after the creation of the African Economic Community in 1991, new constitutions do not attach much
relevance to regional integration, but a clear interaction between national constitutions and regional
directives with respect to democracy and human rights is notorious (Oppong 2008:2,16,18). However,
Courts in Africa have not been active in ruling on regional integration treaties and commitments,
despite the fact that some constitutions may allow such judicial review. In general, regional integration
treaties are treated like other international treaties, without a special constitutional status (Oppong
2008: 23-24).

In Latin America, as it will be explained below in the empirical analysis, despite the constitutional
aims to promote regional integration, in some cases with a supranational character, in practice many
countries are still more inclined to give primacy to national sovereignty, leaving regional integration
agreements at the level of the law (e.g. Colombia). Some of them give regional integration agreements
a higher hierarchy than internal law (e.g. Venezuela and Argentina) but in all the cases, national
constitutions are at the top of the legal system, which means that regional integration treaties are
subordinated to national constitutions.

Self-regulating markets and soft law

Although this paper refers to hard law (law and regional integration treaties), some words should be
said about the growing role of soft law. The process of regional integration has also been influenced
by the growing privatization of markets and vice versa. Private actors are pushing for more
regionalism but they are simultaneously and increasingly self-regulating their markets in less explicit
ways and not only through the institutionalization of their lobbying activities. This transformation of
the traditional paradigms of the legal system has been producing an explosion of the number of
regulations applied in countries not necessarily enacted by the national constitutional and democratic
authorities (Corkin 2013: 636, 648-9). The growing and generalized use of private hard and soft law
by private and public institutions is considered as the privatization of international law with a clear
influence on regional integration and the empowerment of private actors in the global markets vis-àvis
the national states (Peters 2012:78). In other words, besides traditional hard law created by
constitutional national authorities or by means of international treaties in force under the law of
treaties, other kinds of hard law enacted by regional institutions are displacing norms adopted by
national authorities. The latter are also seeing their regulatory competences limited or at least
influenced by the increasing relevance of soft law produced by regional organisms and by private
actors (e.g. codes of conduct, standards, certification schemes, etc., which are now part of a complex
international legal system) (Corkin 2013: 650-651). In some cases, constitutional authorities try to
interact with the non-traditional lawmakers, making explicit the supremacy of their constitutional
competences of regulation or judicial adjudication on all issues related with national or institutional
supranational legal systems (Corkin 2013:659-61). Although there has been reluctance to recognize
the growing relevance of soft law for international law, it has been used by EU authorities13, alongside
self-regulation mainly through Codes of Conduct (Peters 2011: 27,31). Despite the increase of soft law
regulations worldwide, the production of binding hard law does not seem to have been influenced
(Falkner et al. 2005:350, quoted by Peters 2011: 22). Arguments supporting soft law emphasize that it
does not need a formal approval procedure in which different institutions are involved. At the EU
level, it also means a flexible regulation that has marginal effects on national sovereignty of member
states and which guides the interpretation of hard European Law (Peters 2011: 33,36). However, this
may create tensions between institutions (European Parliament and the Commission) because soft law
– in contrast with hard law – does not have a democratic origin and has been associated with the
bureaucratization of the EU (Peters 2011: 44-45; Corkin 2013).


13 Two clear examples of soft law inside the EU have been: the Charter of Fundamental Rights which became hard law with
its recognition in the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, and the Luxemburg Agreement (Peters 2011: 26-7).

3. Methodological aspects

As mentioned before, the central research questions that will be addressed in this paper refer to the
extent to which constituents and legislators worldwide refer in their constitutional texts to the
emerging reality of regionalism and deal explicitly with potential sources of tensions and
contradictions between the national legal systems and the emerging regional regulatory universes. In
addition, we will assess whether there is evidence of increasing constitutional referencing over time,
and of any relationship between constitutional referencing and the depth of the corresponding (de jure
and de facto) regionalization processes.

At the core of our analysis is a jurimetric analysis of a large sample of constitutions. Inclusion of
texts in the sample was as wide as possible, and depended basically on the availability of the
constitutional texts in electronic format. A sample was built from the constitutions accessible through
Constitution Finder.
14 Of all the constitutions available, the texts were selected in the original
language, if the original language was English, French, Spanish, German or Dutch, or –otherwise-- a
translated version into English was used. Dates of enactment and most recent amendments were
systematically registered. If various (consecutive) texts were available for a specific country, they
were all included in the database in order to also make a dynamic analysis possible (see below). Some
micro-states and territories with special status were excluded from the sample. This led to a final
sample of 171 post-WWII constitutional texts, corresponding to 153 countries.

As a first step, all relevant articles were identified and uploaded in a database. As suggested before,
we started from a wide and flexible conceptualization of the regional phenomenon. Any reference to
international regions, independently of its domestic legal implications was registered. However, the
numbers of articles as reported in the tables in the following sections, should be interpreted with some
caution. Not all constitutions are organized in the same way. And therefore the use of ‘articles’ (or
‘sections’) is not necessarily consistent. We have tried to base our analysis on equivalent articles, but –
obviously— some margin for interpretation was unavoidable. However, this should not significantly
influence the main conclusions of our analysis.

In section four, some further analysis of the data is presented. Within the mentioned sample of 171
constitutions, 16 pairs were identified that covered consecutive constitutions for particular countries
(i.e. a given constitution and a posterior new, substantially reformed or amended one), in order to
assess the referencing patterns over time. For another sub-sample of recent constitutions (i.e.
constitutions enacted or amended after 2000), we contrast referencing statistics with measures of de
jure and de facto regionalization. The former is an index of institutional integration, similar to the
integration achievement scores first developed by Hufbauer and Schott (1994), based on Balassa’s
framework (Balassa 1961), further developed and applied by Feng and Genna (2003), and then refined
by Dorrucci et al. (2004).
15 We use the data as reported in De Lombaerde, Dorrucci, Genna and
Mongelli (2011). The latter index, intra-regional trade shares, reflects the relative importance of intraregional
trade as a percentage of total trade of the member states of a given regional organization.16
We use data from the Regional Integration Knowledge System (RIKS).17 This indicator shows the
degree of regional (economic) interdependence and, thus, de facto regionalization.


14 The tool which was used for the identification and collection of constitutional texts was Constitution Finder of Richmond
University [http://confinder.richmond.edu/index.html]. Constitution Finder is an open access tool, made available by a
team affiliated with the University of Richmond School of Law.
15 For a more complete bibliography on indicators of regional integration, see De Lombaerde et al. (2011).
16 For a methodological discussion of the intra-regional trade share measure, see e.g. Iapadre (2006) and Iapadre and
Plummer (2011).

4. Results: frequency and typology of constitutional referencing

We consider thus a large sample of constitutional texts to assess the degrees and ways in which
regions and/or regional organizations are referred to and defined in constitutional texts worldwide. The
analysis of this database is reflected in a number of consecutive tables (tables 1-4). The main results
are the following: Around 50% of all constitutions in the sample refer to international regionalism in
one way or another, which is quite significant (table 1). Most of these cases refer to international
regionalism in one or two articles, although there are outliers of up to nine articles (France). Looking
at broad geographical regions, Asia, Oceania and North-America tend to refer relatively less to
international regionalism, whereas Europe, Africa and South-America tend show relatively more
constitutional references to regionalism (table 2).

Now, when looking at the constitutional provisions more in detail, one notices that the references to
international regions come in various forms, and that they are not necessarily concerned with clearly
defining regional organizations (table 3). They either refer to international regions in rather vague
terms, leaving it to the national authorities to interpret how this should be reflected in a country’s
international relations and what the constitutional and legal consequences of these provisions exactly
are, or they refer to specific regional organizations (e.g. EU, League of Arab States, etc.) rather than to
the generic category. The latter contrasts clearly with how the constitutional principles of foreign
policy are usually articulated. In order to see more clearly, we established a typology of how
constitutions refer to regionalism. The following types were considered: (i) belonging to a wider
cultural region; (ii) belonging to a wider geo-political region; (iii) belonging to a regional organization
and/or the commitment to respect its rules; (iv) mandate to engage in further regional cooperation
and/or formal regional integration in the future; (v) rights for citizens of regional organization comember
states in national elections; (vi) organization of elections of members of regional parliaments;
(vii) compatibilization of sub-national autonomy and supra-national rule-making; (viii)
compatibilization of the constitutional framework and autonomy of national parliament, on the one

hand, with supra-national rule-making, including the treaty negotiation process, on the other; (ix)
requirement of a referendum on regional integration treaties/reforms; and (x) (preferential) conditions
for acquiring citizenship based on belonging to a region or regional organization.

From the distribution of articles in table 3, it can be observed that the four most covered types of
references are: (ii) belonging to a wider geo-political region, (iii) belonging to a specific regional
organization, (iv) mandate to engage in further regional cooperation/integration, and (viii)
compatibilization of national constitutional framework with supra-national rule-making.

In sum, a large number of national constitutions refers to international regions. However, this is
done in a variety of ways with a variety of legal implications. There is still some way to go in the
direction of a more homogeneous treatment of international regions in constitutions and thus
contributing to definitional standardization, but the foundations are laid and through innovation,
imitation and learning it is to be expected that further steps will follow.

Philippe De Lombaerde and Liliana Lizarazo Rodríguez

Let us now have a more detailed look at the constitutional regulations regarding regional integration in
the Americas and Europe, and –more concisely- in other world regions. The following patters can be
identified:

The Americas

In North America, the constitutions of Canada, Mexico and the US do not establish any concrete
reference to the regional groupings to which they belong. In the US the commerce clause of the
Constitution (I,8.3.) gives the competence to the Congress "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign
Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." The competence to negotiate
regional integration treaties is based on this clause.

In Latin-America, as elsewhere, the main trend is to strengthen intergovernmental institutions. But
in this region, this occurs in spite of existing supranational law and institutions. In South America, one
finds a more-than-average number of relevant constitutional clauses referring to international
regionalism (table 2). However, only two countries explicitly refer to existing regional organizations
in their constitutions, and only the Colombian constitution refers to a concrete existing economic
regional integration grouping (Andean Community –CAN-).20 The latter has shown a noticeable
development of supranational law and institutions but it has been progressively losing members,
political relevance and national support. Apart from pursuing a political agenda, the expectation of the
recently created Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) is to succeed in the unification of the
Common Market of the South –MERCOSUR- and CAN, but this regional grouping has a clear
intergovernmental character. The emergence of UNASUR (and also of the Pacific Alliance) has
certainly affected the sustainability of CAN as an institution with supranational characteristics.
UNASUR is promoting a flexible intergovernmental way of regional association without having the
intention to follow the ‘European style’ route of deepening regional integration (Escobar 2009; Vilosio
2010). In any event, some constitutions of South America contain “integration clauses”, but there has
not been enough interest in the development of a supranational regional integration grouping.

In South America, the types of references that are used mostly follow the general pattern as
indicated above, i.e. (ii) belonging to a wider geo-political region, (iii) belonging to a specific regional
organization, (iv) mandate to engage in further regional cooperation/integration, and (viii)
compatibilization of national constitutional framework with supra-national rule-making.

The Chilean constitution does not have any clause referring to regional integration. It has been the
most independent country of the region, following unilateral and bilateral trade policies, and only
being part of the Andean Pact for a very short period of time. It has been active in the promotion
of interregional relations with the Pacific basin and in the negotiation of bilateral FTAs. More
recently, it has entered into a regional agreement with Mexico, Colombia and Peru when the Pacific
Alliance was created.

By contrast, although the constitutions of other countries refer firmly to the respect of national
sovereignty and to the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs, they make explicit reference to
the promotion of Latin-American regional integration. This is the case of Brazil (1988), Peru (1993
(2005)), and Bolivia (2009) (which adds the integration with indigenous peoples of the world).
Colombia (1991) and Venezuela (1999 (2009)), being part of the Caribbean, in addition refers to the
promotion of regional integration with this region.

Uruguay (1967) mentions as goals of Latin-American integration, the defense of their products and
raw materials and complementarity of public services. The Paraguayan constitution (1992) refers to
the Organization of American States (OAS) and mentions the possibility to sign integration treaties in
general (144).

The Constitution of Argentina expressly refers to integration treaties with a supranational character,
although it has also been interpreted in such a way as to place them hierarchically below the
constitution (Gordillo 2005:II17). It is also remarkable that the Constitution imposes as limits to
regional integration, the respect of the democratic order and human rights. In Brazil, the necessary
intervention of the legislative and executive branches to execute international treaties, such as regional
integration agreements, situates them below the Constitution and therefore they can be subject to
judicial review by the Supreme Court (Fontes 2000:8). In addition, given that Brazil is the major
player inside MERCOSUR, it is not particularly pushing for the transfer of sovereignty in favor of
MERCOSUR (Fontes 2000:15-6).

The constitution of Ecuador (2008) mentions as a strategic objective the regional integration with
the Andean region, South America and Latin America (and the Caribbean). It is the most detailed in
this respect and seeks the promotion of a global order with economic and political regional blocs with
horizontal relations. It refers to the free movement of people worldwide and the end of conditionality
in north-south relations. It also refers to the respect of human rights, in particular the rights of
migrants, and rejects colonialism and imperialism and promotes the democratization of international
institutions. At the institutional level, the Constitution of Ecuador is again the most progressive of
South America. It promotes Latin-American and Caribbean citizenship and free movement of persons
in the region, and the creation of supranational institutions of regional integration. Regional
integration may include a productive, financial and monetary union, the adoption of a common
international political economy, taking into account the existence of asymmetries. It also includes the
strengthening of the harmonization of national legislation related with labor, migration, environmental,
social and educative and health. However, international trade agreements should not affect the right to
health, the access to medicines, services or technical and scientific progress. It is also forbidden to
conclude treaties that transfer judicial competences to international arbitration institutions related with
commercial issues, except for the resolution of disputes among states or citizens within Latin America.

Concerning the creation of supranational organizations and the character and scope of the regional
integration regime, the constitution of Colombia (1991) promotes the creation of supranational
organisms, including the creation of a Latin-American Community of Nations, as also mentioned in
the Brazilian constitution (1988). The Colombian constitution establishes the possibility of elections of
Regional Parliaments. The constitution of Bolivia stipulates that the approval of treaties of “structural
economic” regional integration, monetary integration or the transfer of competences to international or
supranational institutions in the framework of regional integration processes should be approved by
referendum. The Venezuelan constitution (2009) also accepts the creation of supranational
organizations and stipulates that the legal rules adopted in integration agreements are part of the
national legal order and of direct and preferential enforcement vis-à-vis internal law.

The Central American Integration System (SICA) is also based on an intergovernmental logic, but
not all the member states are bound to the same extent because each of them has concluded
international agreements with different scopes, instead of entering in a completely reciprocal
arrangement. The creation of a Court inside the organization has been regarded as an advance in the
process of supra-nationalization but not all the member states have approved its creation (Carducci and
Castillo 2012: 24-27).

Europe

Although European constitutions tend to refer relatively more to international regionalism than
constitutions in most world regions (table 2), not all constitutions do so, not even all EU member
states. The Czech Republic (1992 (2009)), Denmark (1849 (1953)), Luxembourg (1968 (1998)), the
Netherlands (1983), Norway (1814), Poland (1997), Estonia (1992) and Lithuania (1992 (2004)) do
not have any reference to “Europe” or an integration clause. The constitution of Greece (1975 (2008))
does not refer explicitly to the EU neither, whereas Bulgaria (1991 (2007)) makes a short reference to
its participation in the building and development of the EU.
Philippe De Lombaerde and Liliana Lizarazo Rodríguez

18

The Constitutions of former imperia (France (1958 (2011)), Portugal 1976 (2005) and Spain (1978
(2011)) establish the promotion of solidarity and special cooperation with countries with the same
language, which is an example of the type of reference consisting in belonging to a wider cultural
region (II). In addition, Portugal includes the principle of non-intervention in internal affairs and
rejects imperialism and colonialism. Sweden makes reference to its membership in the EU but also to
its participation in international cooperation within the framework of the United Nations and the
Council of Europe. Hungary (2011) states that the government shall take into account decisions of the
EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in security issues.

Rules that may be included in the category ‘compatibilization of national constitutional framework
with supranational rule-making’ (viii), in casu the EU, can be classified in four groups:

A first group includes references such as in the constitution of Germany (1949 (2010)) which
highlights that the EU should respect the democratic, social and federal principles, the rule of law, but
it states in particular that EU law should guarantee a level of protection of basic rights, essentially
comparable to that afforded by its Basic Law. Along the same lines, Sweden (1974) allows the
Parliament to transfer decision-making authority without affecting the basic principles and protecting
rights and freedoms recognized by the Constitution and the European Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It forbids the transfer of decision-making authority related
to the enactment, amendment or abrogation of fundamental law, the Parliament Act and its elections,
or related to the restriction of any of the recognized rights and freedoms. Slovenia (1991 (2006)) also
conditions the transfer of rights to the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy
and the principles of the rule of law. The constitution of Greece (1975 (2008)) allows limiting national
sovereignty, insofar as this does not infringe human rights, the democratic government and the
principles of equality and reciprocity. The constitution of Bulgaria (1991 (2007)) also makes reference
to the respect for the rule of law and for human rights.

References in a second group include the constitutions of France and Germany which establish the
superiority of the principle of subsidiarity with respect to a draft European law. National authorities
may present an action before the Court of Justice of the EU to challenge a legislative act of the EU for
infringing the principle of subsidiarity. Portugal also refers to the European identity but under the
principles of reciprocity, the rule of law, and subsidiarity.

A third group concerns the participation of national parliaments in the decisions of the EU. Austria,
for example, has a very detailed regulation of the control of the National Council over the position that
the Government would assume before EU authorities. The government is bound by the opinion of the
National Council during EU negotiations and voting. The government may deviate only for imperative
foreign and integrative policy reasons, but if a constitutional amendment is necessary, then the
deviation is only possible when the National Council does not controvert it. Germany also regulates in
detail the duty of the Federal Government to consult and take into account the position of the
Bundestag during the EU negotiations. The consent of the Federal Government is necessary when an
issue may increase expenditures or reduce revenues for the Federation. Finland (1999) establishes that
the government should prepare the decisions to be made in the EU, unless the decision requires the
approval of the Parliament in which case, the Parliament will participate in the decisions of the EU.
France orders the government to submit to the Parliament the draft European laws. The Parliament
may oppose reforms on the rules of adoption of European treaties according to the rules of the TFEU.
Belgium only mentions that treaties reforming the EU treaties in force should be approved by the
Parliament before their signature. The constitutions of Finland, Hungary, Croatia, Romania 1991
(2003), Slovenia and Sweden establish the duty of their respective governments to keep the Parliament
informed on matters related with the EU decisions/law creation and some of them refer to the
amendments being prepared to the treaties of the EU. The binding force of Parliamentary opinion for
the governments when negotiating before the EU institutions has different levels of intensity in the
various constitutions.
International Regionalism and National Constitutions: A Jurimetric Assessment

19

Finally, a fourth group concerns the status of EU Law in the internal legal systems. Croatia 1990
(2010) retains its sovereign right to decide upon the powers to be delegated and the right to freely
withdraw therefrom. As a consequence of the transfer of competences to the EU, national authorities
should apply EU law directly and Croatian courts shall protect subjective rights based on the EU. In
Hungary, EU law is binding. Romania establishes the prevalence of treaties of the EU and other
mandatory community regulations over opposite provisions of the national laws and all the national
authorities should guarantee their implementation. In Slovakia, legally binding acts of the EU also take
precedence over national laws. The transposition of legally binding acts which require implementation
should be realized through a law or governmental regulation. The Constitution of Ireland 1937 (2011)
clarified that it does not invalidate laws enacted before, on or after the entry into force of the Treaty of
Lisbon, that are necessary for the compliance of obligations of membership of the EU, or prevents
laws enacted by the EU existing before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon. In Portugal, EU
law is enforced in the internal order taking into account democratic principles. The Constitution
recognizes the rules of judicial cooperation in the EU. The only explicit reference of the Spanish
Constitution 1978 (2011) to EU Law is that the volume of public debt held by the public
administration services may not exceed the reference value established in the TFEU21. Spain also
refers to its cultural ties with Latin-America and with other countries with which they have had or
have special links, by facilitating access to Spanish nationality for citizens originating in these regions
or countries. Slovenia refers in general to the principle that legal acts adopted within international
organizations shall be applied in accordance with the legal regulation of these organizations. Greece
stipulates that generally recognized rules of international law ratified by statute shall be an integral
part of domestic law and shall prevail over any contrary provision of the law.

With respect to the type of reference referring to the compatibilization between sub-national
autonomy and supranational rulemaking (vii), the constitutions of Austria (1929 (2008)) and Germany
establish a very detailed constitutional regulation of the proceedings in case EU law creation or
modification could affect subnational entities (the Länder), and in this way it assures the concrete
participation of subnational authorities in the harmonization of their competences with EU law. Along
the same lines, the constitution of Italy (1947 (2007)) establishes that legislative powers of the State
and the Regions are constrained by the constitution and by EU-legislation and international
obligations. Regions may not adopt measures that obstruct the freedom of movement of persons or
goods between regions, otherwise the Government can act if they fail to comply with international
rules and treaties or EU legislation. Conversely, regions may take an active part in the preparatory
decision-making process of EU legislative acts in areas of their competences.

The references related to the rights for citizens of regional organization co-member states in
national elections (v), i.e. the right to vote in local elections for citizens of the EU with residence in
their countries, is recognized by Belgium 1994 (2007), Croatia (1990 (2010)), France, Portugal and
Hungary (2011), which in addition recognizes this right to every person recognized as a refugee,
immigrant or resident. Some of them refer to the elections for the European Parliament too. Referring
to people living in EU countries, France creates the possibility of concluding agreements with EU
members on issues of asylum and Slovenia protects and guarantees the rights of minorities (Italian and
Hungarian) and stipulates that the rights of the Roma community will be regulated by law.

Concerning the reference to referenda on regional integration issues (ix), the constitution of France
establishes that all ratifications of treaties referring to membership of the EU should be approved by
referendum. Latvia 1922 (2005) establishes that membership and substantial changes in the terms
regarding the membership in the EU shall be decided by a referendum. Portugal establishes the
possibility to organize referenda to approve treaties related with the construction or deepening of the
EU. Slovenia offers the possibility to call a referendum before ratifying treaties that transfer sovereign

rights to supranational organizations. Slovakia establishes that a constitutional law confirmed by
referendum decides on the entry into a state union. Hungary’s, by contrast, states that no national
referendum may be held on any obligation arising from an international agreement.

Some general patterns in other regions

Generally speaking, the constitutions of countries in Asia and Oceania refer relatively less to
international regionalism (table 2). Those who do, refer mostly to a belonging to a wider cultural
region (category i) and/or to a mandate to engage in further regional cooperation or integration in the
future (iv) (table 3). In Central Asia, after the disintegration of the USSR, the agreements that seek
regional integration take into account the European model, considering not only trade but also political
cooperation and security matters. However, the development of supranational institutions has not been
pursued. According to some observers, this is related to the lack of democracy and transparency in the
member states (Kembayev 2006:983).

In Africa, the proliferation of regional integration agreements is prevalent and constitutions tend to
refer to regionalism relatively more than elsewhere (table 2). Especially references to belonging to a
wider geo-political region (ii) and to a mandate to engage in further regional cooperation or integration
(iv) are often found (table 3). We refer to the theoretical part where the evolution of some trends in
regional integration in this continent is briefly explained.

5. Results: further analysis

In this section we present some further exploratory analysis of the available data. The questions that
are addressed are the following: “are constitutional references to regionalism increasing over time?”,
and “is the intensity of constitutional referencing related to the intensity of the regional integration
processes?” In order to answer our first question, by looking at consecutive (i.e. replaced, reformed or
amended) constitutional texts, the evolution over time of referencing patterns can be analyzed. Based
on the, admittedly, small sub-sample of consecutive constitution pairs, it would seem that the increase
of references is not necessarily spectacular over time (table 5). On the contrary, it would appear to be a
slow and gradual process. However, the sample size is probably too small here to extract robust
conclusions.

The second question which can be addressed is whether the intensity of constitutional referencing
is related to the intensity of the regional integration processes. We therefore selected a sub-set of 31
constitutions enacted or amended since 2000 (see table 3), and identified the relevant constitutional
references. This information was then re-organized by regional organizations to which the
corresponding states belong (table 6). This allows us then to contrast this information with statistics
reflecting the depth of the integration processes in a cross-section setting. For this purpose, we
selected indices of institutional integration and intra-regional trade shares (see section 2.3). The former
is a proxy of de jure integration, the latter a proxy of de facto integration or interdependence.

As expected, the regions with highest and lowest degrees of institutionalized integration (EU and
NAFTA) are also the ones with the, respectively, highest and lowest referencing intensity (table 6 and
figure 1). However, the association between both variables within the extreme values (i.e. for the
remaining cases) is not linear. In addition, as explained before, the average values that are reported
here, cover quite some variation at individual country level. It is interesting to note that the two cases
that are generally considered as being characterized by supra-national institutional designs (EU and
CAN), are the ones that show highest average frequencies of compatibilization references (i.e. clauses
that seek to make sub-national autonomy compatible with supra-national rule-making (vii); and
clauses that seek to make the constitutional framework and autonomy of the national parliament
compatible with supra-national rule-making (viii)).

21

Apart from the outlier case (EU), the relationship between constitutional referencing and de facto
regionalization seems even less straightforward, at least on the basis of the available data (figure 2).

6. Conclusions

With deeper integration, the paradigms of formal international public law (based on intergovernmental
treaties) and the capacity of national constitutions to interact with it, are tested. This is so for a number
of reasons. A first reason is that deepening regional integration can lead to the creation of
supranational authority and –logically- to constrained, conditioned or diluted national sovereignty.
Although it should be added that, in practice, supra-nationalism and intergovernmentalism are not
necessarily mutually exclusive. A second reason is that regional governance is not only about hard law

but it also has an important soft law component. The proliferation of soft law is not very well visible in
the constitutions but it should not be ignored in the design of regional legal systems. Combining these
two reasons, one can say that increasingly tensions can be sensed between the functioning of national
legal systems and the multi-level governance world surrounding them. Outside Europe, a third reason
is that an evolution can be observed with respect to treaty enforcement by national authorities,
especially courts (i.e. case law on self-executing versus non-self-executing treaties). Finally, a fourth
reason is that in federal or quasi-federal states, there are increasing tensions between the outward (i.e.
international) regional commitments of the federal states, on the one hand, and the constitutional
autonomy and prerogatives of the federated states, on the other hand.

The observation of these increasing complexities leads to the central question which is addressed in
this paper: to what extent do constituents and legislators worldwide refer in their constitutions to the
emerging reality of regionalism and explicitly deal with potential sources of tensions and
contradictions between the national legal systems, on the one hand, and the emerging regional
regulatory universes, on the other. For that purpose, a global mapping exercise was presented. It was
based on an analysis of a sample of 171 constitutional texts, without pretending that the sample
necessarily and systematically included the most recent amendments. We were basically interested in
global and longer-term tendencies.

The main results from our analysis are the following: Firstly, about half of our worldwide sample
of constitutional texts refers to (international) regionalism in one way or another. Secondly,
constitutional references to regionalism come in a great (formal and substantive) variety. In our
assessment, we considered ten different ‘types’. However, many of these references are more political
in nature, with unclear implications for constitutional case law. Our global mapping exercise reveals a
still very fragmented landscape, with a lot of room for conceptual harmonization and convergence,
learning and imitation. In the coming years, more activity is to be expected from constitutional
assemblies and constitutional courts that will re-shape national legal systems to become more
compatible with the changing reality of (international) regional governance.

We also presented some further preliminary analysis. On the one hand, we looked at the dynamics
of constitutional referencing over time. Although comparisons over time are not too robust due to lack
of data, it seems that the number of constitutional references to regionalism over time is increasing
only very slowly. It is still soon to evaluate whether the current global financial and economic crisis is
acting as a catalyst in this respect, but there are indications that this is indeed the case, especially in
Europe (Contiades 2013). On the other hand, we looked at the relationship between constitutional
referencing and (de jure and de facto) depth of the integration processes. Although deeper de jure
integration seems to increase the need for the inclusion of ‘integration clauses’ in the constitutional
texts, this seems to be a loose relationship with a lot of variation. Even in the EU, for example, there
are still various national constitutions without any reference to the EU at all. The relationship between
constitutional referencing and de facto integration is even less straightforward.

These empirical results should be read with a lot of caution. They mainly illustrate how data on
constitutional referencing (to international regionalism) can be related to data on de jure and de facto
regionalism/regionalization and then statistically tested. Before embarking on the latter, however,
further work is needed on building more complete databases (i.e. by including more countries and
more observations per country), more detailed coding, and gathering data on other relevant variables
reflecting the depth, causes and consequences of regionalism. Only then will it be possible to draw
firmer conclusions on the complex causalities between (aspirational and reactive) constitutional
drafting, on the one hand, and de jure and de facto regionalism, on the other.
