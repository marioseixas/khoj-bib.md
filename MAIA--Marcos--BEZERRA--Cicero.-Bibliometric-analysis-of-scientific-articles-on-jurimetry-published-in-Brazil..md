ABSTRACT

Judicial delays have been the subject of debate in the Brazilian academic community. Among the solutions
discussed, jurimetrics has gained ground in seeking quantitative standards in court decisions. However, despite the
relevance of this methodology, in Brazil, few researches have been conducted towards its dissemination.
Therefore, the present study employs bibliometric techniques on national scientific production, articles, related to
the term “jurimetry”, from 2002 to 2019, made available on the Google Scholar search tool, presenting an
information panel on the characteristics found in these publications. The results show that in the period surveyed,
the number of publications on the subject showed an average annual growth of 18.92%; the collaboration index
indicates that there are, on average, 2.32 authors per article, some of which stand out for the number of publications,
including Daniel F. N. Menezes (four) and Filipe J. Zabala (three) and, in turn, the most cited authors are Lee
Loevinger (eleven citations), Filipe J. Zabala and Fabiano F. Silveira (both with six citations); the magazine that
has published the most on the subject is the Revista da Faculdade de Direito of the Federal University of Minas
Gerais, with a single magazine publishing four articles, seven magazines publishing two articles and 66 magazines
publishing a single article; and finally, as for the keywords associated with the term, the words "adoption", "civil
procedure", "invalid act", "illegal act", "partial dissolution", and "successive incidence" stand out, suggesting Civil
Law as an area of law more aligned to the use of jurimetry.

1 INTRODUCTION

Judicial slowness significantly affects the efficiency of the Brazilian judiciary

(BRITTO, LACERDA e KARNINKE, 2018; GARGANO e NADER, 2018; VENTURINI,
SOUZA e BIANCHI, 2018). This situation “became part of the daily discussion of the academic
community, which was forced to seek solutions to this problem that generates great social
dissatisfaction” (BASSI and SCHUMAK, 2018, p. 720). In this scenario, jurimetry is inserted
as an approach with real potential to, at least, suggest directions capable of optimizing the
reasonable time for the solution of legal disputes (COUTO and OLIVEIRA, 2016). This
approach, according to Menezes and Barros (2017), is capable of verifying the impact of law
enforcement on society, allowing to evaluate the effectiveness of public policies and judicial
decisions, showing itself, therefore, innovative in relation to the classic paradigm of scientific
knowledge.
Although there is a growing interest in the study of jurimetry in Brazil, there are few
relevant scientific works (ZABALA and SILVEIRA, 2014). In this same sense, for Menezes
and Barros (2017, p. 80) “undeniable is the value of jurimetry, a methodology that has not been
explored yet, to assess the real social impact of the standard when applied to the specific case”.
Therefore, given the importance of the theme, this study seeks to contribute to mitigate
the scarcity of studies and contribute to this area by answering the following research problem:
what are the characteristics of the scientific publications of jurimetry in Portuguese found in
the research tool of the Google Scholar, until August 2019? It is a bibliometric, exploratory
study that forms a scenario based on the authors with the largest number of publications
involving the term "jurimetry", magazines with a higher incidence of the term, more associated
keywords and the most cited articles.
This article, in addition to this introduction, is organized in four more sections: the
theoretical framework presents the concept of jurimetry, the main studies in the area and the
most used bibliometric laws; the methodological procedures provide the definition of the
analysis corpus, variables to be analyzed and analytical procedures used; the fourth section is
the presentation and analysis of the results and, finally; in the final considerations the
conclusions of the study, its limitations and suggestions for future research are presented.

2 THEORETICAL REFERENCE

This section presents the basic concepts used in the present study, not with the

intention of exhausting such matters, but rather to lead to their understanding.

2.1 Jurimetry: conceptual aspects and applications

Although there is divergence in the literature regarding the origin of the association of

statistical analysis with the study of Law, there is a consensus that this use is very old
(ANDRADE, 2018; MACHADO, 2017; NUNES, 2016). According to Hald (2003), the term
was found in the thesis Dissertatio inauguralis mathematico-juridica (BERNOULLI, 2012),
defended by Nicolou I Bernoulli in 1709. For Rangel (2014), it was with the publication of the
book The path of the law, by United States Supreme Court judge Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.
who became famous for the use of statistics in law, with the phrase “For the rational study of
the law the blackletter man may be the man of the present, but the man of the future is the man
of statistics and the master of economics ”(HOLMES JR, 1897, p. 457).

According to Couto and Oliveira (2016), the term “jurimetry”, a neologism created by

the American lawyer Lee Loevinger, was used for the first time with the publication of the
article Jurimetrics: the next step forward (LOEVINGER, 1971), in a context in which the
application of analytical methods can bring progress and legal certainty. In the United States
there are several law schools and associations that have research centers in jurimetry, having as
references the Society for Empirical Legal Studies and the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies
(MACHADO, 2017). In Brazil, according to Nunes (2016), this term began to be disseminated
in 1973, with lectures by Italian professor Mario Losano. Since then, in Brazil, studies have
emerged that started to address the term “jurimetry”: in 2002, the doctoral thesis of Fernando
Antônio de Vasconcelos (2002) under the title: “Responsibility of the provider for damages
done on the Internet” and José Augusto Delgado's (2002) article, “The computer law”; in 2003,
the doctoral thesis by Alexandre Freire Pimentel (2003), “Principiologia juscibernética.
Telematic process. A new general theory of process and civil procedural law "and the master's
dissertation by Ulysses Alves de Levy Machado (2003)," The convergence between the
privilege of exploring intellectual creation and the elaboration of a right of virtual space with
its consequences about the public domain. ” In 2006, the master's dissertation by Maria Paula
Costa Bertran under the title: “Economic analysis as a guiding criterion for judicial decision:
applications and limits, study based on the case of review of leasing contracts with exchange
parity” (BERTRAN, 2006). In the United States there are several law schools and associations
that have research centers in jurimetry, having as references the Society for Empirical Legal
Studies and the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies (MACHADO, 2017).
For Loevinger (1963), jurimetry involves the use of quantitative analysis, the
application of communication and information theory to laws, the use of mathematical logic in
law, the retrieval of legal data by electronic and mechanical means and the formulation of
calculations aiming at legal predictability . This concept is corroborated by Zabala and Silveira
(2014, p. 75-76), where for whom, “the definitions of Jurimetry vary from author to author,
passing through topics such as Statistics, Computing, Linguistics, Human Behavior and
Science, more generally”.
Nunes (2016, p. 115-116) describes the term jurimetry as to its object and
methodology, characterizing it as the “investigation of the functioning of the legal order”,
whose methodology is to use “statistics to reestablish an element of causality and investigate
the multiple factors (social, economic, geographical, ethical, etc.) that influence the behavior
of legal agents ”. For Couto and Oliveira (2016, p. 779), jurimetry,
seeks to describe the concrete interests of the legal agents, their conflicts and the
solutions given by the judges, with the aim of helping the Law to better understand
the citizens' desires and offer subsidies to the authorities for the production of laws
more in line with social reality, as well as how to function as a fundamental tool for
the development of more just legal institutions, capable of assimilating the living
nature of law and providing society with swift and pacifying jurisdictional protection,
or, alternatively, pointing out the most appropriate non-jurisdictional means of dispute
settlement for each case (mediation, arbitration, etc.).
In this sense, for Andrade (2018, p. 687),

Jurimetry provides a systematic perspective of the factors that influence or that play a
role in decision making by the magistrate, as it helps to define, based on quantitative
elements, standards of legal behavior.
For Menezes and Barros (2017, p. 56) “there are countless advantages resulting from
the application of the proper methodology of jurimetry in all public spheres”. The main
advantages would be
RDBCI: Rev. Dig. Bibliotec e Ci. Info. / RDBCI: Dig. J. of Lib. and Info. Sci.| Campinas, SP | v.18| e020018 | 2020

| 5

the implementation of policies of transparency, inspection, efficiency, cost reduction,
data collection in real time and, mainly, analysis of social reality, which would allow
the evaluation of the effectiveness of public policies, judicial decisions and current
laws when analyzing the corresponding impacts on society.
Couto and Oliveira (2016) present as a positive aspect of the use of statistical
techniques, the aid in the identification of problems and the direction of strategies for solving
the difficulties of knowledge management. The disadvantages include the difficulty in
obtaining data, conservatism and the plastering of the Judiciary. In addition, according to
Menezes and Barros (2017, p. 57), the following challenges must be faced:

a) the difficulty in understanding the statistical language by the lawyer (who, as a rule,
is not familiar with it);
b) the interdisciplinarity to be observed in order to carry out this study;
c) the change in habit represented by the replacement of merely bibliographic research
by empiricism;
d) the control of uncertainties that is characteristic of statistics is not for the law.

Although the difficulty in understanding statistical language was listed, Machado

(2017) reports the existence of the myth that the use of jurimetry is done through extremely
sophisticated methods and with the use of cutting-edge mathematics and computational
resources, limiting its application to only doctors in Exact Sciences. For these authors, a
jurimetric work is any study with an object belonging to the legal world, which has the presence
of data collected empirically and whose analysis is based on some statistical concept. In
addition, it should be noted that the choice of the statistical method to be used does not occur
randomly, but according to what is intended to be identified with the research, always
maintaining care to preserve the representativeness of the population in cases of generalization
of the results. As an example of some methods used, there is the case study, descriptive statistics
and/or correlations, causality regressions and other infinity of theories, techniques and
empirical models.
However, Couto and Oliveira (2016) warn that care should be taken in the direct use
of mathematical tools, since the incessant search for procedural speed could result in a massive
and unsatisfactory judicial provision for the judicial system. This is because jurimetry would
have the function of diagnosing problems and suggesting measures for knowledge
management.
Machado (2017) presents some themes studied with the use of jurimetry, being the
effects of: (a) ideology in judicial decisions; (b) gender in judicial decisions; (c) composition
and voting on panels and peer effects; (d) external pressure from the media or popular opinion
on court decisions. “In addition to gender, there are other factors that affect judicial decisions,
related to minority groups such as race, ethnicity, religious group and social formation, among
others” (MACHADO, 2017, p. 262). A summary of the authors studying these themes is
presented in Chart 1:

Machado (2017) also suggests some themes that should be studied in Brazil:

contractual relations; labor justice; criminal justice; and, gender impacts.
It is verified, therefore, that the use of statistical methods applied to Legal Science,
defined here as jurimetry, can bring benefits, not only to the judiciary and those who use the
Brazilian justice, but to the whole of society, since it will provide a greater procedural speed,
as well as contribute to greater assertiveness in judicial decisions.

2.2 Bibliometrics: concepts and laws

According to Silva, Hayashi and Hayashi (2011) the origin of the term bibliometrics

has sometimes been attributed to Paul Otlet in his work Traité de Documentation: Le Livre Sur
Le Livre, Theorie et Pratique (1934) and, sometimes, to Alan Pritchard, in his book Statistical
Bibliography or Bibliometrics? (1969). However, a distinction must be made between the
concepts presented by the authors. Whereas, for Otlet (1934) bibliometrics is inserted in
bibliology, for Pritchard (1969) bibliometrics has its equivalence to bibliographic statistics,
defining it as a more appropriate term when making statistics from scientific publications. For
Santos (2015, p. 5) “the word bibliometrics comes from the fusion of the suffix 'metria' and
'bibliography', 'information', 'science' and 'library', being respectively analogous or close to their
nature, objectives and applications”. According to Alvarado (2002, p. 90), it is a “set of research
methodologies in the field of Information Sciences that takes advantage of quantitative data
analysis, to explore the framework of a scientific area”. In any case, it is a consolidated concept
that revolves around the application of statistical methods on bibliographic content (SILVA,
HAYASHI and HAYASHI, 2011; YOSHIDA, 2010; CHUEKE and AMATUCCI, 2015).
According to Alvarado (2002), Araújo (2006) and Santos (2015), there are three classic
laws in bibliometry: Bradford's Law (1934) that studies the productivity of journals; Lotka's
Law (1926) that works with the authors' scientific productivity; and the laws of Zipf (2012) that
analyze the frequency of occurrences of words.
RDBCI: Rev. Dig. Bibliotec e Ci. Info. / RDBCI: Dig. J. of Lib. and Info. Sci.| Campinas, SP | v.18| e020018 | 2020

Bradford's Law, also called the Dispersion Law, “allows, by measuring the

productivity of magazines, to establish the nucleus and areas of dispersion on a given subject
in the same set of magazines” (VANTI, 2002, p. 153), as shown in Figure 1:

Figure 1. Bradford’s Law

Source: adapted from Vanti (2002).

Bradford's Law indicates that there are a small number of journals, which are "closely

related to the subject and a larger core of closely related journals, with the number of journals
in each zone increasing, while productivity decreasing" (ARAÚJO, 2006, p. 14). Therefore, it
is suggested that “as new written subjects appear, they will be subject to a small filtering by
related journals, when accepted. As a result, these journals attract more and more articles, in
the course of the development of the area” (SILVA, et al., 2012, p. 3).
Lotka's Law or Inverse Squares Law (LOTKA, 1926) aims to describe the profile of
the authors' scientific productions, the majority of which few authors produce much and many
authors produce little. Moretti and Campanario (2009, p. 70) summarize it as follows: “the
number of authors who make 'n' publications on a given scientific area is approximately 1/n² of
those who make a single publication, the proportion of which is approximately 60% of the set
of authors”. Lotka's Law presented some reformulations, among which, the replacement of the
Inverse Square Method by the Generalized Inverse Power model (PAO, 1985; NICHOLLS,
1986), as demonstrated by Cândido, et al., (2018), in the Equation (1):

 =
− (1)

Where:
γx = probability of an author contributing x publications on a subject;
x = number of publications on a given subject found in a given period of time;
c = theoretical percentage of the authors who contributed with only one article, in the
studied period of time (Lotka coefficient);
RDBCI: Rev. Dig. Bibliotec e Ci. Info. / RDBCI: Dig. J. of Lib. and Info. Sci.| Campinas, SP | v.18| e020018 | 2020

| 9

n = slope of Lotka's Law.

In such a way that c is obtained by the Equation (2):

 =
1

∑
1

 +
1
( − 1)−1 +

2 +

24( − 1)
+1
−1
=1
(2)

Where:
x = number of publications by author;
n = slope of Lotka's Law;
P = observed number of pairs.

And, in turn, n is calculated according to Equation (3):

 =
 ∑ log  log  − ∑ log  ∑ log
 ∑ log
2 − (∑ log )
2
(3)

Where:
N = number of data pairs (publications by author X authors);
x = number of publications by author;
y = number of authors in relation to the number of publications;

The third classic law of bibliometrics is the Zipf Law, which, according to Araújo

(2006, p. 16) “describes the relationship between words in a given text that is large enough and
the serial order of these words (word count in large samples) ”. According to Booth (1967) it is
a law originally proposed by Estoup (2018) in 1916 and popularized by Zipf (2012) in 1949,
whose equation (4) is shown below:

 =  (4)

Where:
c = constant value for any word in a particular text (Zipf constant);
r = position of the word in a decreasing list ordered by frequency;
f = number of occurrences of the word.

This law indicates that “the product of the serial order (r) of a word (given by the

frequency of occurrence in decreasing order) by its frequency of occurrence (f) was [is]
approximately constant” (GUEDES, 1994, p. 318 ). From there, Zipf (2012) identified that in
any text, low-frequency words have, basically, the same frequency. Booth (1967) interprets it
according to Equation (5):

1

=
( + 1)
2
(5)

Where:
I1 = number of words with frequency 1;
In = number of words with frequency n;
n = number of occurrences of a given word.
RDBCI: Rev. Dig. Bibliotec e Ci. Info. / RDBCI: Dig. J. of Lib. and Info. Sci.| Campinas, SP | v.18| e020018 | 2020

| 10

At this point William Goffman “concluded that there is a transition point between high

and low frequency words and that the words contained in this space would have a high semantic
content, that is, words that give meaning to the text” (MELLO, 2017, p. 87 ). This conclusion,
published by Pao (1978), became known as Point of Transition, indicating the “neighborhood
where [...] the words with the highest semantic content should be included”, according to

 =
−1 + √1 + 81
2
(6)

Where:
n = Goffman's Transition Point, known as T;
I1 = number of words with frequency 1.

From the combination of Zipf's laws and Goffman's Transition Point it is possible to

establish, graphically, where the transition from low to high frequency words occurs,
highlighting the words that form the trivial, interesting and simply noisy information sets , as
shown in Figure 2:

Figure 2. Word occurrence zones

Source: adapted from Quoniam, et al. (2001).

Evidently, bibliometrics is not limited to these laws (FONSECA, 1986; CALLON,

COURTIAL and PENAN, 1995; GINGRAS, 2016). That said, considering the importance of
bibliographic references in scientific works (MORAES, FURTADO and TOMAÉL, 2015), we
tried to verify how the citations and references of each of the works are related, through analysis
of citations.
RDBCI: Rev. Dig. Bibliotec e Ci. Info. / RDBCI: Dig. J. of Lib. and Info. Sci.| Campinas, SP | v.18| e020018 | 2020

| 11

“The Analysis of Citations is based on the premise that researchers conceive their

work from previous works and demonstrate this by citing previous works in their texts and in
an ordered and standardized list of references” (MORAES, FURTADO and TOMAÉL, 2015 ,
p. 186). Its objective is “to measure the impact and visibility of certain authors within a
scientific community” (VANZ and CAREGNATO, 2003, p. 251). To meet this objective,
Hirsch (2005) and Garfield (1956) proposed tools to assess the quality of publications and
measure the researcher's productivity and impact. Eugene Garfield (1956) proposed the Impact
Factor (FI): a tool for evaluating the quality of publications, efficient in evaluating the quality
of a journal. For calculating the Impact Factor for a given year “the number of citations received
in that year by the articles published by the journal in the previous two years is taken into
account, divided by the number of articles published by the journal in the same period”
(THOMAZ, ASSAD and MOREIRA, 2011, p. 90).
Jorge E. Hirsch (2005) proposed the H Index, an indicator responsible for measuring
the researcher's productivity and impact, relating the number of publications to the number of
citations. “The H index of a given author will be the number of the numerical sequence of works
whose number of citations is equal to or greater than the rank of the sequence” (THOMAZ,
ASSAD and MOREIRA, 2011, p. 92), as shown in the example Figure 3:

It is important to stress that the laws presented here are not without criticism: for

authors like M. Carl Drott and Manfred Bonitz, the theoretical support for Bradford's Law is
lacking (BORGES, 2002); C. Oppenheimer and Paul Travis Nicholls, on the other hand, point
to weaknesses in the Lotka Law, associated with the estimation parameters (ALVARADO,
2002); as for Zipf's Law, scholars like Pintadosi (2014), Manin (2008) and Aitchison, Corradi
and Latham (2016) warn of the synonymic pitfalls that can affect their results. On the other
hand, there are works using text mining, social network analysis and geoanalysis in bibliometric
exploration (FAVARETTO and FRANCISCO, 2017); operational research techniques, such as
linear programming and decision trees (BORGES, 2002); theoretical probability distributions
and normalization methods applied to the number of citations, percentile-based approaches
(MINGERS and LEYDESDORFF, 2015) and even; qualitative approaches such as metasynthesis
(OLIVEIRA, LIMA and MORAIS, 2016).

4 METHODOLOGICAL PROCEDURES

Using the categorization proposed by Silva and Menezes (2005), the present research

is classified as basic as to its nature, considering that it aims to study the characteristics of the
production of articles referring to jurimetry in Brazil; as quantitative in terms of approaching
the problem, as it aims to measure publications and their specificities; as exploratory in relation
to the objectives for explaining how the subject in question has been studied in the country; and
RDBCI: Rev. Dig. Bibliotec e Ci. Info. / RDBCI: Dig. J. of Lib. and Info. Sci.| Campinas, SP | v.18| e020018 | 2020

| 12

from the point of view of technical procedures, such as bibliography, since the study is
developed through published articles and found in the Google Scholar search tool.
The Google Scholar research tool was defined as a source for the composition of the
analysis corpus, having as its time frame the period from the date of publication of the first
article on this basis, until August 12, 2019 (inclusive). The choice of this tool is due to the fact
that Google Scholar contains all publications present in the Capes Periodicals database. In
addition, Google Scholar has projected itself as one of the main scientific search tools
(FALAGAS, et al., 2008), since its results are as good as that of other scientific research bases
(HARZING and ALAKANGAS, 2016).
The analyzed records were obtained from the search for the term “jurimetry”, plus the
filters: (1) search anywhere in the document and, (2) exclusion of patents and citations. The
search returned 270 publications, of which, from this total, repeated publications were removed,
as well as texts in English and Spanish. All records that were not scientific articles were also

Data analysis was performed using software R version 3.5.1, using the bibliometrics

package (ARIA and CUCCURULLO, 2017). The reference data of the 84 articles were saved
in the BibTex format, exported to the xlxs format and tabulated in the Microsoft Excel 2010
software.

4 PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

In the 84 articles analyzed, it was found that the first work was published in 2002 - it

is the article “The computer law” by José Augusto Delgado. After this registration, there was a
six-year time lag until the next publication in 2008. From that date on, in all years there were
publications related to the researched theme, as shown in Figure 4:

Figure 4. Publication numbers from 2002 to 2019

Source: research data (2019).
It is possible to note, therefore, a clear increase in the number of publications, mainly
from 2013 onwards. Analyzing the entire period, there was an average annual growth of
18.92%.
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics associated with the numbers of articles and
authors:

It is observed that the majority of articles (75.72%) have more than one author,

increasing the statistics of average co-authorship and average number of authors per article to
almost two. In general, the collaboration index reached 2.32, which means that there are an
average of 2.32 authors collaborating per article. It was also registered 36 articles with only one
author and 109 articles with more than one author.
In turn, Chart 4 presents the authors who produced more than one article in the studied
period:

That is, of the 84 articles analyzed, 63 of them were written by authors who did not

produce other articles available on the studied base. In order to describe the frequency of
publication of the authors, the Lotka coefficient was calculated, whose result of 3.77 indicates
that the number of authors who write two articles would be equal to 0.073 (1 / 23.77) of the
number of authors who wrote only one article.
Having identified the authors with the highest number of productions under this
research, the journals with the highest incidence of published articles were investigated. The
results are shown in Table 2:

According to Bradford's Law, it appears that one magazine presents four articles, seven

magazines two articles and 56 magazines a single article. Therefore, it is corroborated that many
journals produce little about the investigated area, as shown in Figure 5:

Except for the word “jurimetry” (precisely the term used in the search), the terms

“adoption” and “civil process” stand out, showing the areas of law with more applications of
jurimetry. Soon after, the words "law" and "statistics", present in five articles, show the very
definition of jurimetry (statistics applied to law). In addition to these, also in the same position
regarding the number of occurrences, the use of "artificial intelligence" stands out, indicating
the application of computer systems capable of acting in a similar way to human, in the field of
Law.
Excluding the word “jurimetry” and applying the 1st Zipf’s Law to the other
keywords, ordered in descending order according to the frequency of occurrence, the values
shown in Table 4 are obtained:

Table 4. 1ª Zipf Law

When plotting the Zipf constants in relation to the series orders, found in Table 4,
Figure 6 is obtained:

Figure 6. Keyword occurrence zones

Source: research data (2019).

It can be observed that the transition point between the high and low frequency words

is the one that has the Zipf constant equal to six, given that the words: jurimetry; law; statistic;
Artificial intelligence are considered as trivial information (Zone I, as proposed by Zipf) and
words with Zipf constant equal to four are considered noise (Zone III). Thus, in order to identify
the word that separates the trivial information zone from the noise zone, the Goffman Transition
Point (T) was calculated, which, when returning a value of T equal to 22, indicates that the 22nd
keyword is the one that displays this transition, as shown in Table 5:

Finally, following the analysis protocol, the behavior of the citations was analyzed, in
order to identify which works and/or authors are being used when working with the referred

Lee Loevinger's works, found in the research, caused this author to be cited more

frequently, including, also, the fact of being considered the precursor of the term under study
(GARGANO and NADER, 2018; LUVIZOTTO and GARCIA, 2020).
Given the most cited publications, the H Index was calculated, an indicator responsible
for measuring the researcher's productivity and impact, relating the number of publications by
an author to the number of citations. For the case analyzed, an H index of 4 was reached, that
is, at least four of the most cited authors have four or more citations. Analyzing the co-citations,
we can see the relationship shown in Figure 7:

Figure 7. Co-citations network

Source: research data (2019).

Figure 7 shows the relationship presented by each author to other individuals, with a

predominance of the 1988 Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil.
It is important to analyze the results found in the light of other studies. In this sense,
corroborating with the laws of Bradford (1934) and Lotka (1926), the findings point to a
concentration, in terms of authors and magazines, that act on this theme. In other words, even
though there was an average increase of publications, from 2002 to August 2019, of 18.92%,
there are few authors and magazines publishing about jurimetry - which corroborates with
previous studies, which emphasize it is a recent theme and still little explored in Brazil
(MENEZES and BARROS, 2017; ZABALA and SILVEIRA, 2014; YEUNG, 2017).
As for what has been published, from the classification of keywords proposed by Zipf
(2012), it is possible to identify recurrently addressed themes. If, on the one hand, the keywords
identified as “Interesting information” have broad meanings (for example, “Law”, “Judicial
decision”, “Slowness”) when, from them, a search is carried out with the so-called “Noises”,
we obtain a more precise scenario about the published studies:

• The themes associated with Family Law stand out, since from the term
"Adoption", in the "Interesting information", it is possible to trace "Noises" of
similar semantic meaning, namely: "right of childhood and youth"; “Family
law”; “Brazilian adoption”; “Consensual adoption”; “Adoption intuitu
personae”; "affection"; “National adoption register (CNA)”; “Adoption
campaigns”; "child and teenager"; “Voluntary delivery”; "family"; “Biological
or original family”; “Substitute family”; “Family reintegration”.

• Likewise, taking the interesting information “Partial dissolution”, it is possible
to trace, along with the “Noises”, the terms “commercial law”; “Brazilian
commercial law”; “Corporate law”; “Partial dissolution”; “Minority partner
extrajudicial exclusion”; “Conflict between partners”; “Positive conflict”;
“Mass conflicts”; "bankruptcy"; “Distinctive protection for companies”; “Legal
protection of private investment”; “Commercial code”; “Business recovery”;
“Corporate types”; “Transfers from business establishments”; “Bank loan”;
RDBCI: Rev. Dig. Bibliotec e Ci. Info. / RDBCI: Dig. J. of Lib. and Info. Sci.| Campinas, SP | v.18| e020018 | 2020

| 20

“Business and contract”.

• It is also possible to notice the presence of studies concerned with the decisions
themselves (albeit in a smaller number), since from the term “Judicial decision”
(“Interesting information”), the “Noises” are registered with the keywords
“empirical analysis of judicial decisions”; “Jurisprudential analysis”; “Judicial
performance”; “Judicial efficiency”; “Procedural efficiency”; “Impact of the
judicial decision”.

Yeung (2017) states that, although in Brazil, jurimetry is at an early stage in terms of

scientific communications, this topic could be of great value when associated with issues such
as contractual relations, especially involving debts and banks; labor justice; criminal justice;
and, gender impacts on court decisions. In this sense, the placement of Yeung (2017) seems to
have been considered in a significant part of the published articles.
The presence of Lee Loevinger as the most frequently cited author is not surprising, as
he was one of the precursors to the study of jurimetry (COUTO and OLIVEIRA, 2016; BISPO
and GONÇALVES, 2019; DUARTE and NUNES, 2020).
Finally, with regard to the analysis of citations and co-citations, the highlight goes to
the 1988 Constitution itself, given the importance of the Magna Carta in relation to legal studies.
In addition, there is a high frequency of citation in the works of Lee Loevinger, the first person
to use the term jurimetry (NUNES, 2016).

5 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

At the end of this study, it is important to state the main results found. In this sense,

between 2002 and August 2019, 84 scientific articles published in Brazil can be found under
the theme of jurimetry, showing an average annual growth of 18.92%. Of the published articles,
there are almost two authors per work, with 36 published alone out of a total of 143 authors.
Two authors stood out: Daniel Francisco N. Menezes and Filipe J. Zabala, the first with four
and the second with three publications. The Journal of the Faculty of Law of the Federal
University of Minas Gerais was the journal with the most publications on the subject. Words
related to statistics, judiciary and civil law (Adoption; Civil procedure; Invalid act and illegal
act; Civil procedure code; Partial dissolution; Successive incidence) were classified as areas of
interest, according to the Zipf Law, which suggests Civil Law as an area of law more aligned
to the use of jurimetry. Lee Loevinger was the most cited author in the works, due to being
considered the precursor of the term under study. Brazilian authors like Filipe J. Zabala,
Fabiano F. Silveira and Marcelo G. Nunes also stood out.
As a limitation, this work explored only the Google Scholar search tool, since other
academic research bases such as Scientific Electronic Library Online and Web of Science, for
example, did not present scientific articles with the term “jurimetry”, though only in Portuguese.
It is important to recognize that other sources such as the Virtual Library Network presented
articles present in the research carried out via Google Scholar. Therefore, studies carried out on
the basis of theses and dissertations are suggested, which, in a way, present more contemporary
research. In addition, specific bases dealing with Law, such as the Brazilian Law Bibliography
(BBD) maintained by the Federal Senate, must be taken into account in future research.
In addition, the study was limited to an exclusively descriptive aspect. It is necessary
to deepen in the context of citations, since, according to Thomaz, Assad and Moreira (2011, p.
90),
RDBCI: Rev. Dig. Bibliotec e Ci. Info. / RDBCI: Dig. J. of Lib. and Info. Sci.| Campinas, SP | v.18| e020018 | 2020

| 21

The number of publications, citations and the average of citations per published
work, taken in isolation, are traditional bibliometric indexes that have
deficiencies, as they do not portray the combined information of published
works with the respective citations.
The opportunity for comparative bibliometric studies, mainly associated with the
analysis of citations, between Brazilian and foreign scientific production is also seen. In this
sense, methods such as text mining can provide a broader understanding of the studies.
Anyway, the criticism regarding the exclusive use of bibliometric indicators, coming
from researchers such as Ioannidis, et al., (2017), Hicks, et al., (2015) and Stephan, Veugelers
and Wang (2017), do not disqualify applications in a context in which scenarios are established
that can shed light on a body of knowledge - of relevant utility in the development of new
studies.
