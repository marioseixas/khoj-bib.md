The division of law into branches, as it has
progressively developed since the 16th century, is
dogmatic in nature and has a weak heuristic value1 . If
we follow, however, the branches of law to their common
trunk, we always arrive at the question that irrigates all of them:
that of the preservation of human life. The covid-19 pandemic
has reminded us of this, since the measures adopted to overcome
it have affected all countries on the planet and have equally
affected national law and international law, public law and private
law. social law. Some commentators consider this to illustrate the
influence of biopower, which, according to Foucault, characterizes
the modern age2 . This interpretation is hasty if not inaccurate.

before the supposed birth of "biopower." .

For Foucault, the term biopower refers to the transit, from the

FOUCAULT'S ERROR

Summarized in Roman law with the formula vitam instituere, the
preservation of a properly human life throughout successive
generations is, therefore, not the distinctive feature of contemporary
forms of government, but rather a constitutive fact of the institutional
phenomenon in general. and of law in particular5 . To understand
this anthropological function, it is necessary that law and institutions
are not reduced to mere techniques of power, nor life to its only
biological dimension. For Louis Dumont, this reduction is a product
of modern ideology, which views society as a collection of individuals
who compete with each other6. Contrary to popular belief, Dumont
maintained, Nazism was the poisonous fruit of this individualism: if
institutions are in fact artifices, if only force reigns among individuals
fighting for life, only biological identity can hold people together.
human communities:

people” or “let them live” – to “an exact opposite power […] of “making
people live” and “letting them die”»3 . But long before the idea of a
secular and sovereign power crystallized in the sixteenth century,
princes and cities have adopted legal provisions aimed at "make live"
instead of "let live", not only to deal with pandemics, but also, more
generally, to preserve the health of their populations. Herodotus, for
example, marvels at the following rule in force among the Babylonians
in the fifth century B.C. C.:

supiot: Law 145

Giorgio Agamben's work offers one of the most complete expressions
of this reductio ad potestam. Agamben has used the Roman legal
category of homo sacer to depart from Foucault's dating of biopower
and affirm that sovereign power has always had life as its object8 .
This thesis has the merit of recognizing that the links between
human life and institutions are structural and do not date from the
19th century, but it gives the idea of sovereignty a timelessness
lacking in historical basis. Roman law ignores it and the feudal order

is based on lordship, not sovereignty. Agamben defines, above all,
sovereign power as the power to decide on the state of exception in
which life can be outlawed, that is, captured and exposed to death.
Based on Carl Schmitt, this definition was certainly appropriate for
Nazism, whose legal practice was perfectly summarized by Göring:
«Recht ist das, was uns gefällt» [law is what pleases us]9. But it
dispenses with the historical experience of sovereignty conceived
as self-limitation of power10, which provided a lasting base for the
rule of law11, while the Nazi state of exception quickly found its
catastrophic limit.

This reduction of politics to power and laws to mere techniques of
domination is a common feature of postwar authors, who have lost
the perception that their great predecessors –Durkheim, Mauss,
Weber or Bergson– had of institutions.

Hitler only carried out to their ultimate consequences certain representations

that are very common in our time, whether the "fight of all against all", a kind of
commonplace of lack of culture, or its more refined equivalent, the reduction of
politics to power. But once these premises are accepted, it is difficult to see, with
the help of Hitler, what can prevent those who have the means to do so from
exterminating whomever they please, and the horror of the conclusion
demonstrates the falsity of the premises. Universal disapproval demonstrates
agreement on values and political power must be subordinated to values. The
essence of human life is not the struggle of all against all and political theory
cannot be a theory of power, but rather a theory of legitimate authority7 .

Confusing sovereignty with omnipotence in this way leads to the
same dead ends that medieval scholasticism had to deal with. In the
face of omnipotence, nothing stands: two and two can be five, the
past may not have existed and the law is completely swallowed up
by the black hole of "power." Thus, according to Agamben, only
"outside all law" would a free life be conceivable12. From this point
of view, institutions merely mask the reality of "power" of which the
concentration camp would today be the secret paradigm; the
departure lounges of the Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle airport would
therefore be declinations of Auschwitz13. Asylum seekers, however,
are not yet gassed or subjected to medical experiments. Agamben
begins by reminding us that the Hitler government was careful to
place the concentration camps outside the legal sphere14.

(Schutzhaft), which had its direct source in the will of the Führer. In
the blunt words of a Gestapo chief quoted by Agamben, "the camps
were not instituted, one day they were there" (sie wurden nicht
gegründet, sie waren eines Tages da). It could not be said more
clearly that the fields belonged to the pure domain of fact. But this
does not prevent Agamben from holding two pages after in the fields
"law and fact merge", which endows them with a "particular legal
structure"15. The fields do not have a legal existence, but do they have a legal structure?

The deportation to the camps was a measure of "protective retention"

Legitimately concerned with shedding light on the phenomenon of
totalitarianism, Agamben thus falls into the trap that Nazism left
behind: subsuming any type of institution under the figure of "power",
an eternal and never-defined principle that he transposes into politics.
the notion of "strength" in physical terms or "survival of the fittest" in

Simone Weill:

supiot: Law 147

It would be unfair, however, to reduce Foucault's thought to the notion of
biopolitics. We are indebted to him for his astuteness in noting that since
the nineteenth century there has been a general retreat in law in favor
of 'standardization techniques'. Unlike law, which places obedience to
general and abstract rules under the control

Agamben's terrifying description of the murder of a young Jewish woman
in Dachau for the purpose of "medical" experimentation testifies to the
powerful sense of injustice that the author of Homo Sacer shares with
his readers. If one were to describe the Nazi regime in the terms of
those who confuse sovereignty with omnipotence, one would be inclined
to see in the industrial policy of extermination pursued by that regime a
paroxysmal form of power to "make people die" rather than "kill people."
exactly opposite power” of “making people live” which, according to
Foucault, defines biopower.

suggests otherwise, characterizing homo sapiens as a "symbolic animal"
for whom these two dimensions of life are inseparable17. Even the wolf
child, the closest manifestation to a "bare life," manifests a feeling of
justice. Treating humans like animals has been a feature of scientism in
general and of Nazism in particular,18 but it is a singular contradiction to
claim that this is the hidden truth of any institution. as he observed

17 See Ernst Cassirer, An Essay on Man: An Introduction to a Philosophy of Human
Culture, New Haven (ct), 1944, p. 44.

If force is absolutely sovereign, justice is absolutely unreal. But is not. We know it
from experience. It is real in the hearts of men. The structure of a human heart is
one more reality of the universe, just like the trajectory of a star. It is not in man's
power to exclude entirely any kind of justice from the ends that man assigns to his
actions. Not even the Nazis could. If it had been possible for men, they probably
could have done it19.

Normalization techniques

This "legitimate claim" implies that, as science advances in its
interpretation of the "true laws" of human society, legal legality should
be replaced by a normalization of behaviors. The task of leaders
would be similar to that of engineers, who apply the laws of physics to
make machines work, or of doctors, who restore health thanks to the
discoveries of biology. The figures of the engineer and the doctor
were explicitly presented as models by promoters of «scientific
socialism» such as Pashukanis to illustrate the purely technical
regulations that would govern in a communist society as soon as the
progressive disappearance of the State was completed26.

In recent years, they have experienced spectacular growth made
possible by the progress of computing and cognitive sciences22. The
novelty of the «normalization society», whose advent Foucault
perceived, does not lie, therefore, as he believed, in its having «life as
its object and objective»23, but, on the contrary, in its find it governed
by a normality discovered by science and no longer by the legality
referred to an ideal of justice. The standardization society was born
with the rise of quantitative techniques, which since the end of the eighteenth century
They led to interpret human societies, following the model of physics
or biology, as measurable and manipulable objects that could be
examined to understand and control their functioning24. This evolution
in the social sciences has undoubtedly been the source of important
progress in knowledge, but it has also given rise to what Renan called
"the bold but legitimate claim to organize society scientifically"25.

supiot: Law 149

The situation was formally different in the Soviet Union, which did have a

constitution; but neither was the State the institutional touchstone there. As

in Germany, it became an administrative machine under the control of a

single party, which was responsible, among other things, for implementing
plans based on calculations of economic utility. The fact that it was not
characterized by a "regime of law" in the sense indicated by the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, does not mean that the Soviet Union was
devoid of norms; but they were not legal norms, that is, general and abstract
rules applied by independent judicial bodies31 . The rule of law gave way
there to the rule by law32.

This change in the type of normativity characterized the turning point

perceived by Foucault and not the appearance of a power that aspired to

"make live" instead of limiting itself to "let live". To understand the

"normalization society" whose emergence he diagnosed, we need to

remember that not all normative orders are legal. Ritual or morality can be

sources of non-legal rules. Similarly, the Sadian order, in which DanyRobert
Dufour has rightly seen

The Nazi State is effectively an oxymoron, since it concerns a regime that

knew no other State than that of exception27. Subjected to the tutelage of
a single party, the Nazi State was a tool for the domination of the superior
race and no longer occupied the place of "third party" guarantor that
characterizes the legal phenomenon28. This position would make no sense
in the totalitarian universe, and it was not held by Hitler either. The structure
of the Nazi regime was not legal, but managerial29. The Führer was not
the source of the law that should be applied, but rather the model to which
to adapt, acting based on how he acted in each specific situation30.

This normalizing ambition did not disappear along with the
totalitarianisms of the 20th century. Today it takes the form of
governance by numbers, extending to all aspects of human life
and all scales of its organization34. It inspires the ideology of the
"total market", which constitutes the realm of a "spontaneous order"
that would animate the action of each and every one of us, if
necessary through artificial intelligence and training techniques
such as "nudges" . » [pushes] from behavioral economics or
compliance [compliance norm]35. In fact, people are forced to
assimilate this immanent order, purged of all heteronomous
references, of which they are the agents and not the owners.
Perpetual peace should soon reign in a flat world, free from the
figure of an impartial and disinterested "third party," populated by
human beings programmed like computers or trained like pets,
thanks to progress in behavioral techniques and, it seems, , of the
block chain technology36. The promise of this radiant future would
make the law obsolete, as witnessed by the semantic changes
registered in the shifts from law to program, from regulation to
regulation, from government to governance, or from morality to
ethics. In all these cases, the objective is to eliminate the distance
between the norm and the subject who in this way is not required to observe it, but to incorporate it.

Like previous vicissitudes of scientism, governance by numbers is
doomed to find its catastrophic limit. The regulation of society, as
Canguilhem has shown, is not a fact of the same nature as
biological regulation. In the case of a living organism, "the norm or
rule of its existence is given by

the vanishing point of economic ideology,33 it may be saturated
with norms, but it can hardly be considered a legal order. On the
other hand, the Sadian order, as a sphere of sovereign power in
the sense given to this term by Foucault or Agamben, perfectly
prefigures the concentrationary universes of the 20th century,
extreme forms of the «normalization society » .

On the one hand, biologism, which by retaining only the feet and

and on the other, post-modernism, which only retains its head, losing its
foothold in reality. Based on these two forms, what Vico called the
"barbarism of reflection" threatens the legal mechanisms aimed at
preserving a properly human life41. Valéry observed that the conquest of
things by positive science would lead to “an elaborate and rigorous form
of barbarism, much more formidable than the ancient barbarities because
it was more exact, more uniform and infinitely more powerful.

The experience of Nazi barbarism gave rise to a legal and
institutional leap without precedent in human history. In the face
of the senseless massacres of World War II, the unsustainability
of a world completely subjected to power relations was confirmed.
Given that "the disregard and contempt for human rights have
resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of
mankind" , the Organization of the United Nations considered
"essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a
last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human
rights should be protected by the rule of law" [essential that
human rights be protected by a rule of law, so that the human
being is not compelled to the supreme recourse of rebellion
against tyranny and oppression]43. Already in 1944 the member
States of the International Labor Organization had agreed that
«experience has fully demonstrated the truth of the statement in
the Constitution of the International Labor Organization that lasting
peace can be established only if it is based on social
justice» [ experience has fully demonstrated how true is the
statement contained in its charter, according to which permanent
peace can only be based on social justice]44. It is impossible to
overestimate the importance of the experience of the two world
wars. Social justice is not only affirmed as an ideal, a moral duty
that should weigh on nations and counteract political and economic
realism, but it constituted in itself a sample of realism or, more
precisely, it would mean the awareness of the historical experience
that had seen humiliation and poverty give rise to hatred, violence
and war "which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to
mankind" [which twice during our lifetime has inflicted untold
suffering on humanity ]Four. Five. A novelty in this flurry of
declarations of principle was the affirmation that justice and peace
could only be based on "the faith in fundamental human rights, in
the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of
men and women." and of nations large and small»

facts – these fundamental texts thus affirm the fiduciary character of
a legal order that, according to Valéry's words, could not be based
on "la seule contrainte des corps par les corps". [the exclusive
coercion of bodies by bodies]47.

It was that they accommodated the physical dimension of human life
by proclaiming that “the recognition of the inherent dignity and of the
equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world” [the recognition
of the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members
of the human family constitutes the foundation of freedom, justice
and peace in the world]48. This new principle of dignity, solemnly
affirmed in the Preamble and in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, only appears, significantly, in relation to economic,
social and cultural rights, beginning with the right to social security
( Article 22). Recognizing dignity means attributing immeasurable
value to the life of each person. This non-mer cantizable value –
regardless of price, to use Kant's term – encompasses the body and
the mind and therefore requires covering physical needs.

The novelty of these declarations, however, did not lie in the fact
that they affirmed the primacy of legal relations over power relations.

These had been largely brushed aside in the statements of the
Enlightenment, which aimed at a completely dematerialized "man";
This is why economic and social rights were said to be "second
generation" rights. This chronology is, however, misleading, because
the right of the hungry to receive help from the rich was in the Middle
Ages the original object of the doctrine of natural rights49. The
principle of dignity was expressed for the first time in fact regarding
the duties towards the men and women most exposed to physical
misfortune, the poor50. It is therefore understandable that dignity,
the founding principle of social justice and of economic and social
rights, has been attacked by defenders of neoliberalism since the
early 1980s.

The hallmark of the “society of normalization” is not – as Foucault
erroneously claimed – biopower, but scientism, which erects
fetishized science in the “new universal church”51. Like its
predecessors, this church aspires to subject all human beings to
identical laws that are beyond its deliberation. These immanent
laws, inscribed in human nature, occupy the place previously
granted to the transcendent laws revealed by God. As Alexander
Grothendieck observed, scientism "is just as irrational and
emotional in its motivations, and just as intolerant in its daily
practice, as any of the traditional religions it has supplanted."
Governments should not boycott the laws of such scientism, but,
on the contrary, facilitate its action like a watchmaker "oils a watch
or in any other way ensures the condition of a mechanism so that
it functions permanently and correctly"52. The perimeter of
democracy is thus reduced as the progress of knowledge of these
laws advances, which are imposed without discussion as technical
norms through pedagogy or constriction, so that "the government
of the people gives way to the administration of things»53. The
laws and the State have no other function than to grease the
wheels of the self-regulated market. As Polanyi observed: "The
mechanism set in motion by the principle of profit had an
effectiveness comparable only to the most violent outburst of
religious fervor in history"54. But this mechanism claims to be an
experimental science, whose statements, like those of religion,
are by their nature removed from all democratic deliberation.
Again, this time through neoliberal reason, it is about replacing
the rule of law with the rule by law and reducing law and the State
to the function of an "oil placed in the gears" of the immanent laws
discovered by the economic science, whose imposition is carried
out outside the conscience of human beings and independently of
the rationality or irrationality of their behaviors (principle of maximization, self-regulation of the market, stability

The reign of scientism

Machine Translated by Google
Under the "Washington Consensus", the submission of law and
states to this "spontaneous order" of the market was entrusted to
international or regional organizations (wto, imf, eu), which worked
methodically to dismantle labor law, social security systems and
public services, the three pillars of the social state

This search for scientific recognition was crowned in 1969 with the
creation of the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in

memory of Alfred Nobel. Achieved plagiarism of the other Nobel
prize winners, this consecration places economic studies at the
same level as physics and biology, whose statements are by nature
exempt from any democratic deliberation57. According to one of its
winners, Gary Becker, the laws of economics derive in fact from
those of genetics and natural selection, the only ones capable of
explaining the dialectic of egoism and altruism observed in human
behavior58. Hayek, one of the most famous "Nobel-winning
economists", devoted his early research to the biophysical conditions
of emergence of consciousness and conceived the "spontaneous
order of the market" from the Darwinian model of natural selection59.
This search for an anchorage in biology continues today in behavioral
economics, which borrows the technique of randomized studies
from medicine with the aim of getting the poor to behave well in the
world as it is instead of questioning themselves. about his justice60.

rules imposed by "the spontaneous order" of a market

The scientific faith in the spontaneous order of the market clashes with
the legal mechanisms of the social State, but even more so with the
realities of the crises it generates. The covid-19 pandemic has
reaffirmed for a time the fundamental importance of the preservation
of human life, the core of legal and social institutions, and States have
briefly recovered their role as guarantors of last resort for physical
security in their territory. The legal vector of this resurgence is the
«right to health»64, whose priority requires us to question some of the
«structural reforms» imposed in the name of the market. The pandemic
has consequently revealed the degradation of the healthcare system
due to governance by numbers, as well as the inability of private
insurance companies to shoulder the financial burden of vaccination
and work interruptions.

We live today in a schizophrenic regulatory order in which the legal
principles and values that emerged from the crisis caused by the Second

built to apply the principles of social justice proclaimed in the great
international Declarations and in the constitutions adopted after the
Second World War. During the last decades, it has become somewhat
of a good tone to mock the humanist emphasis or denounce the
perversity of these Declarations, which would be nothing more than
the mask of the imposition of the political on life61. Foucault never
opted for this nonsense. Instead, he denounced the "inflationary
critique of the state" and declared that "everyone participating in the
great statephobia" was "going with the flow." He was not only one of
the rare philosophers to perceive the crucial importance of social
security, but also defended it against "the savage liberalism, which
would lead to individual coverage for those with the necessary
resources and to the absence of coverage for the rest»63.

The creators of the World Health Organization, perceiving the

health-related risks, sought to mobilize it in 1946 with the intention of
avoiding such threats. One of the primary impulses of this active
solidarity in the face of illness is – as it was among the

On the one hand, the "Preamble" of the Constitution of the WHO
establishes that: "The extension to all peoples of the benefits of
medical, psychological and related knowledge is essential to achieve
the highest degree of health." But, on the other, since the creation of
the World Trade Organization in 1994, this knowledge has become
the object of private property, which is precisely opposed to its
"extension to all peoples", according to the Agreement on the
Aspects of Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) 66.
Until then, international law accepted that the protection of public
health interests prevailed over the interests of patent owners. The
TRIPS Agreement reversed this hierarchy and gave primacy to the
protection of industrial property.

jurist Rudolf von Ihering considered a task that had to be endlessly

pressing issue of the right to health in times of global pandemic.

The principle of protecting public health had led many countries,

from the patentable scope. The case of India is particularly

71 The possibility of such compulsory licensing was introduced in 1925 in
the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.

The Indian Patent Act passed in 1911 was amended in 1970 to exclude from

its scope of application public health products and agricultural products "in the

interests of health, nutrition and existence of Indian citizens"68. From there, a

powerful Indian pharmaceutical industry emerged, which provided low-cost

generic drugs to meet the country's needs and enable exports to other countries

in the South. In the early 1990s, the price of AIDS treatment was around $700

a month; In 1993, after making use of the rights provided for in the Patent Act

of 1970, the Indian company Cipla began to manufacture generic medicines at

a price of $300 per month, which significantly reduced its cost. India, which was

a net importer of medicines until the early 1980s, has become a major

exporter69. This strategy has provoked strong reactions in the West. The

American Academy of Sciences, closely related to the American pharmaceutical

industry, was alarmed at the risk of losing its dominance in emerging markets.

In 1997 he asked the Clinton administration to enforce the intellectual property
rights of the US pharmaceutical industry around the world under the Agreement

At the beginning of the new millennium, this emphasis on intellectual property

caused a major dispute between the United States and South Africa over the

by the director general of the WTO and even by Biden, at that time
recently elected president of the United States78. Without daring
to contradict him head-on, European politicians have been very
reluctant towards the proposal and have defended a policy of
charitable donations from rich countries to poor ones, now
maintaining that "developing" countries are incapable of producing these vaccines79.
But countries like India and South Africa are demanding the release
of patents, precisely because they already have large
pharmaceutical industries80. As an actor in the market order, the
European Union constantly presses for the establishment of
"structural reforms" that reduce the obligations of employers with
social security and public services, although both serve to "make
people live." At the same time, he defends the high level of
mandatory fees that favor multinational pharmaceutical companies,
despite the fact that such fees lead to "letting people die." Faith in
the total market, the most recent avatar of scientism, considers
human life as a means and not an end. We observe here the
conflict between a legal logic based on the imperatives of social
justice and solidarity and a normalizing logic intended to grease
the mechanisms of the "spontaneous market order." As we
indicated previously, the "fight for rights", claimed by von Ihering,
has become more urgent than ever81.
