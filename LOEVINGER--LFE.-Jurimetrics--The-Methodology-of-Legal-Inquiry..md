JURIMETRICS: THE METHODOLOGY OF
LEGAL INQUIRY

LFE LoEviNGE*

INTRODUCTION

The terms "science" and "law" have both been used for so long by so many
writers with such a variety of meanings, dear and unclear, that one who aspires to
clarity or rigor of thought or expression might well hesitate to use either one. The
lawyers are no more agreed on what constitutes "law"' than are the scientists on
the meaning of "science."' Further, there have been many who claimed that law is
a science, and it is still asserted by eminent scholars that jurisprudence is "the science
of law.' 3 Exhaustive reading is not required to establish that there is neither an
iuthoritative nor a generally agreed definition for any of the terms "jurisprudence,"
''science" or "law."
Nevertheless, each of these terms does designate an activity that is being conducted
by an identifiable group of men. Lawyers and judges are engaged in practicing law
and adjudicating. There are physicists, chemists, biologists, anthropologists, psychologists,
and a host of others, engaged in activities that are universally recognized as
science. And numerous professors, joined by an occasional eccentric lawyer, are
engaged in writing articles and books that are either labelled or indexed as "jurisprudence."Without
undertaking either an exhaustive or definitive analysis of the activities
of these groups, the general nature of their respective activities is fairly evident.
Lawyers and judges generally are engaged in seeking to apply the principles or
analogies of cases, statutes, and regulations to new situations. Scientists generally
are engaged in collecting experimental and statistical data and in analyzing them
mathematically. Writers on jurisprudence are engaged in the philosophical analysis
of legal concepts and ideas

LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS

Through the years there have been those who called upon law in the name of
jurisprudence to become truly scientific. As early as 1895 Justice Holmes asserted that
"An ideal system of law should draw its postulates and its legislative justification
from science."' There can be no doubt that this great legal mind thought that at
least potentially, the techniques of physical science could solve the most basic problems
of law. For the rational study of law, he declared, "the man of the future is
the man of statistics";6 and he projected the ideal of "an ultimate dependence upon
science because it is finally for science to determine, so far as it can, the relative worth
of our different social ends .... ."7
Following Holmes, there have been others in the present century, although relatively
few in relation to the whole profession, who have thought that "scientific
methods of inquiry" should be applied to the field of values, including ethics, politics
and law,8 or that we should have an "experimental jurisprudence" in which scientific
data would be used to determine legal issuesY However, little actual work has been
done along these lines. The "law-science" symposia that have been published have
been devoted to the narrow field of utilizing medical evidence to prove damages in
personal injury cases.10 The resources of science have been used by law enforcement
agencies, notably the Federal Bureau of Identification, to identify and convict
criminals. There have been numerous studies of criminality from the viewpoint of
psychology, psychiatry, and sociology. But nothing that can fairly be called even
a beginning toward a "scientific jurisprudence" has yet appeared.

It would appear that either the problems of jurisprudence are not susceptible of
investigation by science, or that there has not been sufficient interest in this possibility
to produce any results. These are not necessarily the only alternatives, and it may be
that science will yet fulfill the fondest hopes of those who think it capable of

producing a blueprint for Utopia. I think this most unlikely. Rather, it seems that
the activities of those who practice jurisprudence and those who practice science are
so unlike that there is very little communication and no exchange of work between
them. Jurisprudence is engaged in asking questions such as: What is the nature of
law? What is the end or aim of law? What is property? Why should people
perform promises? Why should we punish criminals? Why should a man be held
liable for negligence? These are questions that seek ultimate answers, like the
"Why" of a curious child. 1 These are not questions that can be asked in or answered
by any scientific discipline. In so far as there are answers to such questions as these,
the answers are those of philosophy, ethics, aesthetics, or theology. In response to such
questions man can offer only speculation, preference or faith. The unanswerable
questions of life belong to the realm of philosophy,' 2 and jurisprudence is the
philosophy of law.
On the other hand, in science a question is meaningless unless it is possible to find
some operation by which an answer may be given to it.' While form is certainly not
determinative, the questions of science, in contrast to those of philosophy, are likely
to be of the "How?" variety: How do you know that? How do you do this?'4
The questions of science do not seek ultimate answers, but only immediate answers,
subject to further correction and modification as additional questions are formulated'
One cannot convert philosophy to science merely by adopting the vocabulary or
imitating the methods of science. To conduct a scientific inquiry, one must first ask
a scientific question-one that poses a problem that science is capable of investigating.
A scientific question must be one that can be answered, at least partially, by doing
something and observing the result.
These considerations suggest why we do not have and are not likely ever to
have a jurisprudence that is "experimental" or "scientific." Those who are interested
in jurisprudence are, naturally enough, interested in the traditional questions and
problems of jurisprudence. Although the term and the field of jurisprudence could
be changed or extended to designate a new set of problems and operations, there is
neither a reason for nor an advantage in doing this. On the contrary, an insistence
that new problems and procedures are within the field of jurisprudence will inevitably
be provocative of more futile disputes as to the "proper" scope and method of jurisprudence.
It seems much more appropriate and profitable to use a different term for
a different set of activities. Thus the term "jurimetrics" has been suggested, and is

gaining some use, as a designation for the activities involving scientific investigation
of legal problems. '
It is unnecessary, and perhaps impossible, to give a precise definition to the field
of jurimetrics. As in any pragmatic discipline, the definition will be given by the
activities of its practitioners, and will undoubtedly change and expand as experiment
and experience give answers to specific questions. The distinction between jurisprudence
and jurimetrics is already evident. Jurisprudence is concerned with such
matters as the nature and sources of the law,1 the formal bases of law,'" the province
and function of law,'9 the ends of law and the analysis of general juristic concepts."
Jurimetrics is concerned with such matters as the quantitative analysis of judicial
behavior, the application of communication and information theory to legal expression,
the use of mathematical logic in law, the retrieval of legal data by electronic
and mechanical means, and the formulation of a calculus of legal predictability.2 '
Jurisprudence is primarily an undertaking of rationalism; jurimetrics is an effort to
utilize the methods of science in the field of law. The conclusions of jurisprudence
are merely debatable; the conclusions of jurimetrics are testable. Jurisprudence cogitates
essence and ends and values. Jurimetrics investigates methods of inquiry.
The validity and importance of this approach has recently received official
recognition. The Behavioral Sciences Subpanel of the President's Science Advisory
Committee issued a report on March 21, 1962, with the approval of the White House,
in which it recommended action to strengthen the behavioral sciences and improve
their use.2 2 The report stated, inter alia:

The general aims and criteria of evidence of the behavioral sciences are the same as they
are in other sciences; however, it has so far frequently been necessary to settle for more
approximate answers--errors of measurement may be large, and often, where experiments
are not yet possible, correlations still substitute for cause-effect relations. The number of
variables apparently needed to understand many kinds of human behavior, when combined
with random or uncontrolled variations familiar in most of the life sciences, account for
imprecision of results. Nevertheless, behavioral scientists are finding ways to develop
and test meaningful theories; they have managed to amass a considerable store of tested
and useful information.

THE METHODOLOGY OF LEGAL INQUMY 9

The impact of the behavioral sciences on our society is far greater than most people
realize. At one level they are providing technical solutions for important human
problems. But at a deeper level they are changing the conception of human nature-our
fundamental ideas about human desire and human possibilities. When such conceptions
change, society changes.

Progress in behavioral science has come about by using the scientific processes of observing,
experimenting, and extensively following up and correcting working hypotheses.
Indeed, all the general attitudes and strategies of physical and biological science have found
a place in behavioral science.

Unsolved behavioral-science problems that are clearly solvable, and for which methods of
attack are already identified, are no longer minor and trivial. Instead, both their scope
and their scientific importance are substantial and steadily increasing.

As the report points out, recent developments in many areas of the behavioral
science have been so rapid and diverse that it is difficult for anyone to get a complete
picture of their scope and depth. This can only be suggested by examining illustrative
examples of current research. One of the most interesting and seminal areas
of work now being done in the field of jurimetrics involves the utilization of
electronic computers for the storage and retrieval of legal data.

II

ELErCroNIc DATA RETIEVAL

The task of data retrieval is one of the most basic, pervasive, and important of all
the functions performed by lawyers and judges. This includes the activity which
lawyers commonly refer to as "legal research," but also considerably more. It is
important to note that when lawyers use the term "legal research" they mean librarysearching,
whereas scientists use the term "research" to mean laboratory experimentation.
For the sake of both clarity and generality the term "data retrieval" is more
useful in the present context.
One of the principal aspects of data retrieval in the law is that of finding
applicable, analogous, or relevant precedential authority in the reported cases for
determination of some current question 3 Indeed, a large part of the formal professional
education of the lawyer consists of training and exercise in the analysis of
problems, the use of a legal vocabulary, and the use of legal index systems in order
to perform this task. But this is by no means the extent of the data retrieval problem
confronting the lawyer. The problem exists, in varying degrees of difficulty with
respect to at least these categories:
i) statutes
2) court decisions
3) administrative regulations
"
0 On the general considerations applicable to this problem, see Loevinger, An. Introduction to
Legal Logic, 27 Iuo. L.J. 47, (1952).
LAw AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS

4) administrative decisions and orders
5) title records
6) mortgages, liens, and similar recorded instruments
7) cases and judgments in courts of record
8) patents
9) trademarks
io) legislative history
ii) legal periodicals and other literature
12) files, records, and evidence in big cases

Consideration of the growing mass of material in nearly all of these categories
has pointed to the need for improved techniques of handling the material.24 Indeed
it is not too much to suggest that unless some more efficient means is found for
dealing with the constantly increasing volume of case material alone, the common
law system itself will be in some peril. It is becoming increasingly difficult to search
for and find the relevant authority in the enlarging bulk of all reported cases; and
as this difficulty increases, so does impatience and dissatisfaction with the system.

A. The Pittsburgh "Key Words in Combination" Project

In response to the twin stimuli of this need plus the emergent development of
computers developed for other purposes, a number of experimental projects have been
undertaken in the field of electronic retrieval of legal data. One of the first projects in
this field, and probably the most extensive and sophisticated one undertaken to date,
is that of the Health Law Center at the University of Pittsburgh. Under the direction
of John F. Horty, a research staff at the University began a study of hospital law in
1956 and undertook the writing of a manual on the subject. 25 The staff found that
much of the material from the several states was statutory, but that there was little
uniformity in indexing from state to state. Therefore research could not proceed
in reliance on available indexes. As the interest moved into broader areas of "health
law," the difficulties increased. To meet such practical problems, the staff undertook
the storage of relevant statutory material on magnetic tapes for use in electronic
computers.
In order to avoid problems of abstracting, indexing, or pre-coding, the full text of
all statutes within the universe selected is recorded on tape. As an indication of the
order of magnitude involved, the full text of the entire body of Pennsylvania statutes,
composed of about 31,000 sections and comprising some 6,23o,ooo words, is recorded
on four reels of tape.2 As each statutory section is recorded it is given a document

number in serial order. When the statutes have been recorded, a vocabulary of
the words used in the statutes is prepared by computer. Common words, such as
"the," "a, .... an," "therefore," "however," "by," and various other pronouns, conjunctions,
and articles are eliminated as of no significance for retrieval purposes. All
other words are recorded on separate reels of vocabulary tape which also list the
document number of each section in which each word appears. The four reels
containing the full text of the Pennsylvania statutes require five reels of vocabulary
tape.F
When material is sought from the recorded statutes in the Pittsburgh system, the
question is formulated and then phrased in terms that appear in the vocabulary
of the statutes (the terms appearing in the statutory vocabulary can readily be
determined as an alphabetical print-out is obtained from the vocabulary reels). This
question is then "programmed," or arranged in a series of steps each involving an
operation that the machine can perform. In effect, the machine is instructed to find
and report all documents containing a certain word, or, preferably, certain words
appearing in specified combinations. Both the words, the combinations, and the
relationships (including order and spacing of words) are contained in the instructions
given the machine. The appropriate words to use in searching for statutes relating
to a subject of interest are determined either by examination of the vocabulary list
or by consulting a thesaurus of legally-related (rather than strictly synonymous)
terms. The search instructions are then formulated to secure all sections containing
the key words in the specified combinations. These may call for all sections in which
two words (or any other number) appear regardless of order; they may require the
words to appear in a certain order (as in the phrase "good faith"); they may require
the words to appear in the same sentence or within a certain number of words of
each other.
For example, suppose the question put is: What are the rights of illegitimate
children and the duties owed to them by their parents under Pennsylvania statutes?
The steps that are to be programmed, expressed in ordinary language, will be these.

First, find and store the numbers of all documents which contain one of the following
words:

child
children

minor

Second; find and store the numbers of all documents which contain one of the following
words:
parent
parents
unwed (or) unmarried (in the same sentence and within one word
of one of the following)
father
fathers
man
men
mother
mothers
woman

Label this list-B
Third, set up and store a list of the numbers of those documents which contain both a
term on list A and a term on list B. Label this resulting list-C.
Fourth, find and store the numbers of all documents which contain one of the following
words:
bastard
bastards
born (in the same sentence and separated by two words from the
word) wedlock
illegitimate (where it does not occur with the word "purpose" in
the same sentence)
natural (occurring within one word of any of the terms in list
A)
Label this list-D
Fifth, merge the numbers in lists C and D and print the full texts of the documents whose
numbers appear on the resulting list-E.
It is possible to give the computer three forms of output commands: "list, "cite,"
or "print." The command "list" causes the computer to list the document numbers
of all sections meeting the criteria of the search. The command "cite" causes the
maehiuie to print the section numbers resulting from the search in the form of
conventional legal citations. The command "print" produces the full text of all
sections (or documents) resulting from the search.
This system of storage and retrieval has been called the "Key Words in Combination"
approach by the project director, John Horty. 8 . It has certain obvious advantages
and disadvantages. The full text recording avoids the problem of conventional
abstracting, which is not only a problem of analyzing the legal significance
of a document, but also requires foresight as to all possible applications and implications
of the document that may arise in the future. Of course, such foresight can
never be complete, and to that extent every abstract is likely to be inadequate.

i Ibid. KWIC is also used to refer .t6 the similar Keyword-In-Context index developed by H. P.
Luhn of International Business Machines Corporation.
TE METHODOLOGY OF LEGAL INQUIRY 13

Abstracting involves the further practical problem that it is most difficult to
employ sufficient first-rate talent to do all such work that needs to be done in the
law. Thus, every lawyer searching for material that is indexed by conventional
abstracts, regardless of his own ability or diligence, is limited by the ability and
performance of the abstracter. The system of full text recording is completely openended
in the sense that it permits search for novel relationships, and, indeed, imposes
no limitation or requirements upon the search except that it be in the vocabulary
of the text. This, of course, may be a substantial limitation but there are available
techniques to deal with it.
Probably the principal merit of this system is its efficiency in affording a high
degree of probability of retrieving relevant data. A test of the comparative efficiency
of the system was made by running six searches (including one dealing with the
rights of illegitimate children, used as an example above) both by computer and
manually (which is the current idiomatic euphemism for mental effort in this field).
The computer searches produced more than twice as many references (177) deemed
relevant by the researchers as the manual searches (72), and the manual searches
produced a minimal number of references missed by the machine (2).
There are several disadvantages of the system of full text storage. It may very
well be impractical for handling data that are more voluminous and less structured
than statutes, since this would require recording an impractical mass of material.
It is estimated that it would require ioo reels of tape to record the reported decisions
of Pennsylvania, which is twenty-five times as many reels as those containing the
statutes of that state. Presumably the vocabulary reels for the cases would be in
proportion. Further, the mass of case material will increase at a much greater rate
than the mass of statutes. The cost of recording this mass of material would be high.
More important, a single search of this number of tapes, using present equipment
and techniques, would be uneconomic by any standard. Further, full text recording
of documents of substantial length, such as judicial decisions, vastly increases the
difficulty of developing sophisticated and discriminating search systems.

B. The Western Reserve "Semantic Coded Abstract" Project
A system particularly keyed to handling voluminous and complex material has
been developed at Western Reserve University and has been called the "Semantic
Coded Abstract" approach.30 Western Reserve University established a Center
for Documentation and Communication Research in 1955, which has been engaged
since that time in the investigation of methods of searching literature by electronic
machines.s' The principal work done by the WRU Center has been in the field

of metallurgy, but it has also done substantial work in other fields of science, engineering,
and medicine. In 1959 and i96o, some work was done in the legal field on
an experimental and pilot project basis, using the sales provisions of the Uniform
Commercial Code and cases interpreting this part of the code. The same methods
of abstracting, indexing, storage, and retrieval were applied to the legal material
as to the non-legal material.
In the semantic coded abstract system, the documents to be indexed are first
abstracted manually in some detail3 2 The abstract is recorded in natural language
stating the significant index terms, role-indicators assigned by the abstracter to show
syntactical relations between the terms, and punctuation symbols performing a largely
conventional function. This abstract is then copied on a key-punch unit and the
punch card is put through equipment which automatically retrieves semantic-code
equivalents from the file for the abstract terms, role indicators, and punctuation,
and transcribes the abstract onto magnetic tape in the semantic code. The semantic
code is the heart of the WRU system. It consists of a series of four-unit combinations
of letters and numbers which symbolize the logical elements of the terms to be
encoded, and of a highly simplified symbolic grammar which consists of three-unit
combinations of letters called "role indicators" which are used to translate the variety
of English syntactical expressions into a uniform and consistent coded pattern.
The four-unit combinations of letters are called "semantic factors" and are constructed
by using three letters to symbolize a particular concept while varying the
fourth letter, called an "infix," to indicate variations of that concept. For example,
the basic concept -information is symbolized by the semantic factor DOCM. The
infix "A" symbolized the idea a form of. Thus the semantic factor DACM symbolizes
the logical concept a form of information. A four-digit numerical factor
added to the four letter semantic factors symbolizing a term serves to distinguish
synonyms or close approximations from the logical elements of the specific term.
For example, the concept of swimming is analyzed into the logical elements of
motion and water. The forms of the term are differentiated by various infixes symbolizing
different logical correlates, thus:

swim: MATN HVDR 2001 (ie., a form of motion acting upon water)
swimming: MUTN HVDR 2001 (i.e., used for motion acting upon water)
swam: NWTN HVDR 2001 (i.e., acted upon by motion acting upon water)

Each of the foregoing terms has essentially the same basic logical concept and therefore
has the same exterior numerical factor. Examples of related concepts that are
distinguished by the numerical factor are blueprint and specifications. In encoding
the term blueprint it is analyzed into the logical elements of (a) a form of information,
(b) used to regulate, and (c) acting upon construction. These ideas are
symbolized by the semantic factors of:
"The description of the semantic coded abstract system and the illustrations given in the text are
taken from the references cited in notes 30 and 31, supra.
THE iTHODOLOGY Op LEGAL INQUIRY

DACM-a form of information
RUGL-used to regulate
CVNS-acting upon construction

However, the logically similar term specifications analyzes into the same elements
and is represented by the same semantic factors. Therefore an exterior numerical
factor is used to distinguish these terms, which are represented in this fashion:
blueprint: CVNS DACM RUGL 3002
specifications: CVNS DACM RUGL 3 ooi

It is obvious that the analysis of terms into logical elements may be a difficult
task. Therefore the system utilizes a code dictionary in which terms and phrases
are correlated to generic concepts and which also acts as a thesaurus of terms. The
code dictionary is on punch cards so that abstracts and questions can be quickly and
automatically checked against the dictionary.
When a request for search is made in the semantic coded abstract system, the
question is analyzed in the same manner in which a document is analyzed for
abstracting. When the logical elements of the question have been determined by
manual analysis, they are checked against the code dictionary and encoded in the
semantic code. The coded question is then put on punched paper tape, which is
run through the computer to secure documents that fit the specifications of the
question. The output of the machine consists of the serial numbers of relevant
abstracts, which can then be examined in their uncoded version to determine the
citations of original documents that are desired.
The semantic coded abstract system is by no means a complete departure from
traditional indexing. It depends upon persons skilled in the relevant field to select
and record significant aspects of the subject matter for future retrieval, and also to
construct search specifications, leaving only the mechanical process of comparison
and correlation of search specification with index to the machine operation. Furthermore,
the use of coded semantic factors to represent conceptual relationships involves
the creation of indexing "cluster points" which are similar to the "Key Numbers"
of the West Publishing Company's digest system. The WRU system does avoid
the rigidity inherent in the hierarchical topical arrangement of the conventional
digest system and permits coordinate indexing and searching. It certainly has a
flexibility that exceeds any conventional index; permits searches for specific words,
generic concepts, or both simultaneously; and provides for specificity or generality
at almost any level of abstraction.
The normalizing of language and use of a machine thesaurus permits the retrieval
of documents that may be relevant although they do not contain any of the terms
used in the search. This characteristic would be of particular value in problems
that might involve comparative or foreign law. However, the WRU system not
only does not avoid the problems and limitations of manual abstracting but imposes
16 LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS

some additional functions on the abstracter, thereby exacerbating the difficulties of
this process. Further, the system imposes its own logic on both the library of
stored material and on each question. It remains to be demonstrated by further
work both that this can be done successfully with a large body of legal material and
that, if done, it will not unduly constrain the use of such material.
There are also "computer languages" that have been developed and used successfully
in particular applications, such as COBOLP3 However, the primary purpose
of these is to facilitate programming and secure compatibility among various computer
systems, rather than to establish the conceptual or logical framework within
which data may be manipulated. The law possesses its own conceptual framework,
and it seems dubious that it will prove useful to attempt to impose an additional
logical structure on legal material for purposes of an automatic retrieval system.

C. The Oklahoma State "Points of Law" Approach

The existing conceptual framework of the law itself is used for storage and
retrieval in the "Point of Law" approach used at Oklahoma State University 4 This
system involves the analysis of each document (case, legal periodical article, or whatever)
by a lawyer to determine the legal issues decided or covered. Each point of
law is given a code number, which, of course, represents the particular concept
involved in that point of law. For example, the legal concept res ipsa loquitur is
represented by a single code number. When a field of law has been completely
analyzed, a directory is prepared, listing all points of law in alphabetical order and
showing the code numbers corresponding to each legal concept. In storing data, legal
material is recorded in its conventional form on magnetic tape except that it is
preceded by the appropriate code number or numbers.
To secure material in this system, the lawyer must analyze his problem to determine
the point (or points) of law involved and then check against the system
directory to insure that he has chosen a point that is included in the system. If he
finds his point of law listed, he ascertains the corresponding code number and
requests the machine to search for all material indexed under that code number.
The machine will print out the legal citation of material identified by the code
number, the citation plus head-notes or the citation, head-notes and complete text.
A search can be made for a number of points simultaneously.
This system appears to be essentially a matter of putting the familiar West Key
Number system, or something very much like it, on computer tape. It has the
advantage of utilizing concepts and terms that are already well known to lawyers
and thus working with an idiom that lawyers are willing to accept. However, it
seems to be limited in both its adaptability to new concepts and its ability to absorb

University in this field was being conducted by Professor Robert T. Morgan, whose untimely death may

large additional quantities of data while still retaining the advantages of fast and
economical searching. The system obviously has the limitations and disadvantages
of all systems that rely on manual abstracting, and, in addition, depends upon the
coincidence of analysis by the asbtracter and the questioner, possibly even to a greater
extent than present conventional digest systems. This is the kind of a system that
the lawyer first contemplating automatic data retrieval imagines the future will
provide 5 However, the scientist in the field says, "Direct mechanization of traditional
library classification is like building locomotives to run with legs." 6

D. The "Association Factor" Method
While some have been seeking to use the new technology of electronic data
machines to perform conventional tasks faster and more easily mechanically, others
have been developing genuinely new methods of problem solving. One of the
most interesting techniques in the data retrieval field, of particular significance to
law, is the development of the "Association Factor" method of retrieval3 This is
a system in which the terms of a question are automatically expanded to retrieve
relevant documents that may be indexed under other terms, and the search is so
processed by computing correlation factors electronically that the documents resulting
from the search are delivered with a rank order of "weight" indicating probable
relevance to the inquiry.
In the association factor system the collection of documents is initially indexed
by the uniterm coordinate index system. This is indexing by terms drawn from the
text of the documents themselves without any topical or hierarchical arrangement.
In coordinate indexing the index terms are independent of each other and data is
retrieved by manipulation of the index terms, usually (although not necessarily) to
secure a "match" or "intersection" of two or more terms that will designate an, intersection,
or other logical function, of the classes represented by the index terms and
that is likely to contain documents desired? 8 In the coordinate indexing used in
reported applications of the association factor system the effort was made to eliminate
all synonyms by cross referencing them to a single term in a thesaurus used as part
of the system? 9 Two files are prepared, as in usual coordinate term indexing. The
first is a document-term file showing the index terms assigned to the respective
documents. This information is recorded on punch cards in this format:
Document i: Term a, Term c, Term d, Term x, etc.
Document 2: Term b, Term d, Term e, Term y, etc.
Document 3: Term a, Term b, Term f, Term z, etc.

by Documentation, Inc., z962). This contains an excellent bibliography of the subject.
" Stiles, supra note 37.
LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS

The cards are then processed by machine to produce an inverted term file on magnetic
tape in the following format:

Term a: Doc. i, Doc. 3, Doc. 5, etc.
Term b: Doc. 2, Doc. 4, Doc. 6, etc.
Term c: Doc. i, Doc. 4, Doc. 8, etc.

This gives a list of all index terms, together with the serial or accession number of
each document indexed by each term stored on magnetic tape available for subsequent
computer manipulation. The actual indexing in the applications of this system that
have been reported to date has been done manually, but it could just as well be
done automatically when satisfactory methods of automatic indexing have been
developed.
In the use of this system, when a search question has been formulated it is fed
into the computer, which then derives the association factor expressing the numerical
value of the degree of association between each term of the request and
each index term by an established formula.40 In essence, this shows the index
terms that occur in the same document as any of the request terms, and the degree
of coincidence between them as measured by the number of documents in which
both occur more frequently than might be expected if there were no logical
association. Terms are dropped if they have an association factor of less than i.oo,
or some other specified value, with terms of the request. The remaining terms
provide a list of index terms associated with each term of the request. This list of
associated terms is called a "term profile."
It should be noted that the term profiles contain terms that are statistically, but
not necessarily semantically, related. The second step, after preparing a term profile
for each term of the request, is to compare the term profiles of all the request terms
and then select those index terms which appear in all or a given number of profiles.
These selected terms are called "first generation" terms. In selecting the first generation
terms it is possible to select terms that represent the logical product or logical
sum or other logical function of request term profiles. Synonyms or near synonyms
are not likely to be found in these first generation terms.
The third step in this method is to take the list of first generation terms and
to use these as request terms repeating the process of the first two steps. The new
terms secured at this stage are called "second generation" terms. These second
generation terms are likely to include synonyms, various grammatical forms, and
"o The formula used by Stiles, supra note 37, for computing the association factor is:

log0 o- -B- =ASSOCIATION FACTOR.

where A is the number of documents indexed by one term; B is the number of documents indexed by a
second term; f is the number of documents indexed by the combination of both terms; and N is the total
number of documents in the collection. If AB is greater than fN the association is negative.
Tm METHODOLOGY OF LEGAL INQURY 19

even variations in spelling of the request terms. The fourth step is the preparation
of an expanded list comprising the original request terms, the first generation terms,
and the second generation terms. All of the terms on this list will now have an
association factor greater than the minimum specified as acceptable for the search.
The association factor of each term in this list to every other term in the list is
computed and added. The sum of these association factors for each term is then
divided by the total number of terms on this expanded list. This gives a weight
which indicates the probable relevance of each term on the expanded list to the
original request.
The fifth step in this system is to search the document collection by matching
terms in the expanded list with the index terms of each document in the collection.
Whenever any terms match, the weight of the request term on the expanded list is
assigned to the corresponding document. The sum of these weights for each
document is the document relevance number. This indicates the degree of fit
between the request and the contents of the document. The documents thus retrieved
are then arranged according to these weights and the search thus produces
a list of documents arranged in order of probable relevance to the initial inquiry, the
higher numerical value indicating greater probable relevance. It is notable that this
system will retrieve documents that may be relevant to a request even though the
document has not been indexed by any terms in the initial request.
The association factor system is extremely flexible since it develops the interrelationship
of terms at the time of each search, rather than fixing it in advance
according to any predetermined system. The system may be used to obtain a response
in as much or as little depth as is desired by varying the weight of probable relevance
that is acceptable in retrieving documents. The association factor system has been
successfully used in experimental application to legal material, including both statutory
and case material, although the results of this experiment have not yet been
reported in a publication. 4' The initial use of an automatic thesaurus to expand the
terms of a request, coupled with association factor manipulation, promises to provide
one of the most powerful tools for data searching and retrieval that has yet been
devised.

E. Probabilistic Indexing

The association factor system operates upon the search procedure to provide
retrieval based upon comparative relevance. There are other systems that secure
a similar result by modification of the indexing. The basic concept seems to have
" An experiment in utilization of the association factor system was undertaken with a body of legal
material relating to antitrust law at the Graduate School of Public Law of George Washington University,
Washington, D.C., in 1961 and 1962. The project was supported jointly by the school and the Datatrol
Corporation, and the work was in large part supervised and conducted by John Lyons. A paper giving
a summary report of the experiment was prepared in August 1962 and distributed at the American Bar
Association convention in San Francisco; however, the project has not yet been fully reported in any
publication. Mr. John Lyons has graciously made the summary report available to the author of the
present article and has assisted the author by providing additional information.
20 LAW AND CONEMPORARY PROBIEMS

been suggested by Maron and Kuhns in proposing a system of "probabilistic indexing."
2 They point out that that there is no strict one-to-one correspondence
between the information content of a document and its set of indexes. All indexing
is based upon an estimated probability that if a user wants information of the kind
contained in the document he will formulate a request using the assigned index term.
However, since there is a degree of uncertainty inherent in the assignment of all
index tags, it is more reasonable and realistic to make the assignment of index tags
on the basis of a probabilistic judgment. This is done by weighting index terms
assigned to documents with relevance numbers which indicate the probable relevance
of a document for anyone framing a request including that index term. This
technique is called "probabilistic indexing."
In the procedure actually adopted for testing this technique, a collection of documents
was read, and keywords were selected and listed by the readers. The
keywords were then sorted into categories on the basis of a subjective judgment as
to their meanings. A keyword could belong to more than one category. The
categories of keywords were then assigned names or meaningful labels or tags, which
were thereafter used as index terms. The index terms, or category names, were then
assigned to documents by giving each document the index term of every category
containing a keyword that appeared in that document. Each document was then
re-read and the reader, or indexer, assigned a weight from an eight point scale
indicating the degree of relevance of the index term to the contents of the document.
This, of course, is a probabilistic estimate, or an indication of probable relevance to
a request for information.
Retrieval in this system is accomplished by presenting a request in terms taken
from the index vocabulary, together with the value of a relevance number below
which documents are considered not to be of sufficient importance to be useful.
The computer will then locate documents indexed by request terms, rejecting those
that have less than the threshold relevance value, and will produce an ordered list
of documents which satisfy the request, ranked according to their probable relevance.
In experimental usage, it was found that the system efficiently retrieved relevant
documents and required the reading of substantially fewer documents than conventional
systems. However, the experiments were of limited scope, and it appears
in any event that the high degree of dependence of this system upon human reviewers
greatly reduces its efficiency.
A proposal to secure the advantages of probabilistic indexing while making the
assignment of relevance values automatically by mathematical formula, rather than
by subjective estimate, is involved in "latent class" analysis and indexing.4 3 Latent 42 Maron & Kuhns, On Relevance, Probabilistic Indexing and Information Retrieval, 7 J. As'eu roR
COMPUTING MACHINERY 216 (i960).
48 Baker, Information Retrieval Based Upon Latent Class Analysis, 9 id. 512 (x962).
THE METHODOLOGY OF LEGAL INQUIRY

class indexing depends upon the use of keyword index terms, but it eliminates the
step of reducing the keywords to categories and assigning relevance numbers to
the connection between the data and the category names. Latent class analysis forms
large categories (called latent classes) of documents, which deal with a common
topic, upon the basis of the relationships among the keywords in the total collection
of documents.
First, the categories, or latent classes, are formed by determining the degree of
association among the keywords of the whole document collection in a manner
roughly similar to the determination of the association factor mentioned above, but
utilizing different mathematical procedures. Next, a "response pattern" is determined
for each document. This is simply a pattern of concurrence of index keywords
found in each document. Then the documents are assigned to the latent classes on
the basis of correspondence between the response (or keyword) patterns in the
documents and the keyword organization of the latent classes, and an ordering ratio
is computed for each document which represents the probability that the keyword
pattern found in that document will be generated by (or be found in) a document
from that latent class. In other words, the ordering ratio represents a statistical
probability relationship between the keyword pattern that might be expected from
a document that fits the keyword pattern of a latent class perfectly, and the keyword
pattern actually occurring in each document assigned to the latent class. Thus the
ordering ratio is a practical indicator of probable relevance of each document to the
keyword pattern of each latent class.
Documents are then to be stored by latent classes, with a specified minimum
level of relevance as indicated by the ordering number of each document for inclusion
in each class. A single document may be stored in more than one class,
provided that its ordering number for each class is greater than the minimum
specified for inclusion in that class. Searching is done by putting a request in terms
occurring in the keyword vocabulary used for latent class analysis, and by specifying
a minimum ordering number or degree of relevance desired in retrieved documents.
The computer uses the pattern of keywords to locate the latent class which has the
highest probability of containing documents that may yield the pattern of keywords
in the request. The search will then secure the documents stored in the identified
latent class and having ordering numbers higher than the minimum specified,
arranged in rank order according to probable relevance to the request. The latent
class indexing system has not yet been used in information retrieval, and therefore
its utility is speculative. It is apparent, however, that it would require recomputation
and reorganization of the latent classes and of the documents assigned to the latent
classes as the total collection of documents grows significantly in size. While not
an insuperable problem, this may be an important practical objection to the use
of this system.
LAW AND CoNTEMPORARY PROBLEMS

III
LEX-Tm ANTITRUST DivisION's SYSTEM
An attempt to use machines for the storage and retrieval of legal material that
is more practical than experimental has been undertaken recently in the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice 4 Since this attempt was made for utilitarian
rather than scientific reasons, the system may be less interesting and original than
some of those mentioned above that are seeking to develop or test new techniques.
However, because it is designed and used for practical purposes, the DoJ system
may have its own particular interest for lawyers.
In designing and constructing a data retrieval system for the Antitrust Division,
there were certain requirements that constituted minimum specifications. First, the
system had to be capable of handling a large body of data of various kinds including
such material as briefs, judicial opinions, and statutes. Second, the system had to
be open ended so that material could be added continuously without undue difficulty.
Third, the system had to be operable with the relatively limited equipment presently
owned by the Department of Justice. Fourth, the system had to be adaptable to,
and capable of taking advantage of, more advanced equipment when that becomes
available. Fifth, the system must be capable of being designed and operated with
a relatively small staff of specially trained professionals (there are just two lawyers
with training in computer theory and technology on the staff at the present time),
although some additional lawyers without technical training in the field and a small
staff of technicians (machine operators etc.) might be available to assist. Sixth, the
system must be readily explicable, as well as comprehensible to and usable by a large
staff of lawyers with a high order of legal skills but no special training or interest
in the new techniques of data retrieval. Seventh, the system must be compatible
with existing library and legal methods, which will necessarily continue to be used
by the staff for all matters not covered by the system. Eighth, the system must
be more efficient than existing available indexes and methods of indexing. Ninth,
the system must be economical.
The system which has been designed and put into partial operation toward the
end of 1962 appears to meet the requirements specified, although no firm conclusions
can be hazarded until there has been a substantial period of experience in using it.
In any event, it is anticipated that there will be significant modifications made as
experience is gained. The DoJ Antitrust Division system is designed as a legal index
and accordingly has been named "LEX" by its designers. LEX will be in four parts.
Part one will index court decisions relating to antitrust law. Part two will index
"A Legal Reference and Data Retrieval Unit has been established within the Antitrust Division
to deal with problems of storing and retrieving various kinds of data. This unit has been in charge of
Mr. John Lyons and Mr. Michael Duggan who have devised and put into operation the system described
in the text. This system has not previously been described in any publication. The description in the
text is based upon the author's personal knowledge- of the system. Credit and thanks must be given to Mr.
Lyons and Mr. Duggan both for their achievement in designing and constructing the system and for their
assistance to the author in providing information for this article.
TI MAETHoDoLOGY oF LEGAL INQURY 23

material originating in the Antitrust Division, such as memoranda, briefs, and official
statements. Part three will index the legislative history of antitrust and related
statutes. Part four will index legal periodical material related to antitrust law.
At the time of writing, parts one, three and four are still in preparation and only
part two has been substantially completed and put in use. However, the system is
essentially the same for all four parts, so a description of part two will serve adequately
to characterize the other parts.
The urgent need for part two of LEX arose out of the fact that the Antitrust
Division has had several hundred lawyers continuously engaged in practicing antitrust
law for many years, and that these lawyers have been busily engaged in producing
briefs, memoranda, and similar material on many facets of antitrust law
throughout that period. Nevertheless, there has been no systematic indexing of this
material previously. Consequently there was no way of knowing whether a given
problem had been exhaustively analyzed and considered in some previous memorandum
or was being encountered for the first time, other than the memory
of older staff members and such information as might be obtained by inquiry among
other staff members. Even these sources were not very readily available to the
approximately one hundred lawyers stationed in the six field offices of the Division.
Thus the prompt provision of a workable means of retrieving this material was a
matter of some importance.
Like most other present indexing systems, LEX uses a manually created abstract
of the underlying document. For material generated within the Antitrust Division,
it is thought that the author can do the best job of abstracting. Accordingly, abstract
sheets have been mimeographed and distributed to all lawyers-with instructions
to fill out one abstract sheet and furnish it, together with two copies of the document,
to the Legal Reference Unit for every memorandum, brief, or similar document
drafted. Of course, it is not essential that the abstracting be done by the author of
the original document, and there is a small staff of lawyers available to the Legal
Reference Unit for abstracting. Each abstract sheet shows the title and date of
the document abstracted, an abstract in enough length and detail to indicate fully
the contents of the document, the name of the author of the document, the tide of
the case to which the document relates, and a few other items that are thought to be
of possible interest, such as the commodity involved, names of parties, court, and
various file numbers.
The abstract is reviewed in the Legal Reference Unit by one and sometimes two
lawyers with some experience in abstracting. When thought appropriate, reference is
made to the original document to correct or expand the abstract. The reviewer in
the Legal Reference Unit then assigns descriptors to the document to serve as index
terms. The descriptors are simply terms that are thought likely to be associated in
the mind of a lawyer with the contents of the document. So far we have devised
no system for selecting descriptors objectively, although we recognize this as desirable.
LAW AND CoNmMPORRY PROBLEMS

It is hoped that by having descriptors assigned to all documents by a small staff,
some uniformity may be achieved. However, experience casts some doubt on this,
as documents that have accidentally been processed twice with an intervening period
of time have not been assigned identical descriptors. There is no limit to the number
of descriptors that may be assigned to a single document, and most documents are
expected to be indexed by ten or more descriptors. Each document is then assigned
a serial or accession number.45 Punch cards are then prepared for each document,
containing the document accession number, the descriptors indexing the document,
the abstract, and the other information contained on the abstract sheet. These
cards are then processed by machine to produce nine different lists which comprise
the basic index used. These lists are printed out, reproduced by reduced photo-offset,
and made available to the staff as a single index volume in nine sections.
Section one is a thesaurus of terms used. This is to provide cross-references
among descriptors and from synonyms or near-synonyms to descriptors. This
section can and will be expanded to afford reference from any word likely to be used
by a lawyer to some related descriptor.
Section two is a descriptor index. This is a list of descriptors alphabetically
arranged, and provides a reference to the number of each document that is indexed
under each descriptor.
Section three is a compilation of abstracts arranged in serial order by document
number. It is intended that anyone using the index will refer from some other
section to this section in order to determine from the abstract whether the documents
he has found cited are relevant to his search.
Section four is a statute and rule index which lists antitrust statutes and federal
court rules in order by conventional methods of citation. Under each citation is a
reference to the numbers of all documents containing significant internal references
to the statute or rule cited. In view of the relatively limited number of statutes and
rules that are of importance in the antitrust field and the high clustering of references
to a few statutes, it is doubtful that this section will prove to be of much value. If
it does not prove useful, it will. be dropped from future editions of the index.
Section five is a subject matter index. This is an arrangement of topics and
sub-topics in conventional hierarchical classification with document numbers under
each entry. The arrangement of this section is similar to a conventional legal digest
system, except that the LEX system has been constructed for the antitrust field
and therefore is more detailed with respect to the law in this field than any other
presently available index. This section offers a conventional alternative to the descriptor
index as a means of seeking relevant references on the basis of subject matter.
Whether such an alternative will continue to remain desirable when more advanced
equipment and techniques are available remains to be determined. For the present,
" In the first edition of part 2 of LEX all documents were assigned both a serial number and a microfilm
accession number. However this appeared to be unnecessary, and all documents are now assigned
a single serial-accession number which serves both to identify and locate the document.
TRE METHODOLOGY "OF LEGAL INQUIRY

the availability of thdse two differing index approaches offers the opportunity for
comparison of their efficiency in use.
Sections six, seven, eight, and nine are more specialized methods of finding
potentially relevant documents from particular known information. Section six is an
index based on "Blue Book" numbers. These numbers are assigned in serial order
chronologically to all antitrust cases brought by the Department of Justice. The
"Blue Book" numbers are available both from internal and from published sources.
Section seven is a product classification index. Commodities are listed in numerical
order according to the Federal Supply Classification system. Section eight is an
index based upon the names of defendants arranged in alphabetical order. Section
nine is an index based upon the names of the authors of documents arranged in
alphabetical order. In each of these last four sections the index shows the numbers
of all documents generated by the case, product, defendant named (i.e., case) or
author listed in the respective index section.
The full text of all documents listed is stored on microfilm. The microfilm is
contained in magazines identified by letters. The first part of each document
accession number consists of two ltters that identify the microfilm magazine which
contains the text of that document. To read a document, the appropriate magazine
is inserted into the microfilm reading machine.4 6 This automatically illuminates the
screen and starts the film drive motor. An image appears on the screen which
identifies the number of the document positioned for reading. A lever on the
machine causes the film reel to be rotated until the desired document image is reached,
when the motor is stopped and the document is read. If a copy of a page or of an
entire document is desired, a button is pushed and a print of the desired page or
document is made automatically.
It is self-evident that in its present form LEX is a relatively rudimentary and
unsophisticated apparatus for retrieval of legal data. Although the assignment of
descriptors permits coordinate indexing and retrieval, the descriptors will probably
not be utilized for the discriminating selection of which they may be capable.
However, there are several important advantages of this system.
First, it is the only one now in actual use by a group of practicing lawyers who
have no special training in the use of such. systems. It is thought that whatever
system is ultimately developed will eventually have to be adapted to use by lawyers
who are not specially trained in its use. Experimentation with a system that, whatever
its other shortcomings, is in actual use by lawyers is likely to contribute greatly
to the development of a better system to meet the needs of lawyers.
Secondly, it is believed that the basic structure of the LEX system, involving the
storage of full text of documents on micro records with index terms and abstracts
recorded on punch cards, tape discs, or similar means for manipulation, is the pattern
that will ultimately be found most practical and economical.
"The machines presently in use are Recordak Lodestars.
LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS

Thirdly, LEX provides the opportunity for feedback in use. In actual searching
for legal reference material, there is a constant interchange of information and instructions
between the searcher and the body of data. As information is secured,
the search is modified; finding a particular case, citation, or dictum may wholly
change the direction of the search. It is thought essential to provide the means of
maintaining such feedback in any system that is to be found practical by lawyers.
An elaborate and sophisticated search system that is of such complexity that a
substantial period of time must elapse between asking one question, securing a
response, and asking a second question is likely to be less useful than a less complicated
and less sophisticated system that furnishes a rapid response to questions and
permits the asking of successive questions quickly.
Fourth, LEX is flexible and can be easily adapted to more refined techniques and
more advanced equipment when that becomes available. The index terms used
by LEX provide coordinate indexing that is adapted to automatic searching, and
can also be used in a system of association factor searching. Since documents are
also independently indexed by their own abstracts, LEX can utilize natural language
questions in automatic full text searching of abstracts. While this is not quite the
equivalent of full text searching of original documents, it may serve as a practical
substitute.
Finally, automatic indexing and abstracting may be utilized when and if the
techniques and equipment for performing this function satisfactorily become available.
Since the full texts of all documents are stored on micro records, automatic
abstracting and indexing may be applied to documents already recorded, as well
as to new accessions.

IV

MICRO-IMAGE STORAGE OF DocuMErNs

A. From Circulating to Duplicating Libraries

The structure of LEX is dictated in substantial part by an appraisal of the
potentiality of equipment. No one can predict what may be possible in the future
in recording, manipulating, and retrieving data by electronic devices. Conceivably,
it may become possible to record all the decisions in a field of law, or perhaps in the
entire law, in such fashion that their full text can be searched electronically in
microseconds. But no device capable of doing this is available now or foreseeable
in the near future. On the contrary, the mass of material to be stored in even a
limited field such as antitrust law is so great that putting it all on computer tape
is not only unduly expensive but is almost prohibitive to search. On the other hand,
techniques and devices now available will permit full text storage and retrieval by
micro records of virtually unlimited quantities of material.
For example, a recently reported technique for the storage and dissemination of
microdocuments has made high density document storage feasible at a linear reduc-
TH METHODOLOGY OF LEGAL INQUIRY 27

tion of 200:I, representing an area reduction of 40,000:1. This is known as the photochromic
micro-image technique, or PCMI.47 Using this technique, it is possible to
record a 300-page book within one square inch of film. A 3 x 5 inch photochromic
plate can contain 2,625 micro-images, and by reproduction on a micro-image card,
the entire contents of eight to ten average size books can be recorded on a 3 x 5 inch
card. A file of one million document pages can be stored in micro-image form on
less than 400 3 x 5 inch cards, which are a stack about four inches high. It is
calculated that the total volume of all reported judicial decisions is slightly less
than 5,000,000 pages, and that all statutes constitute about another iooo,ooo pages.4s
Accordingly, by this method all reported judicial decisions and all statutes can be
recorded in full text on 3 x 5 inch cards in a file approximately 24 inches in depth.
In this system, any desired document page can be retrieved and read or printed out
in a hard, full size copy quickly and on demand.
Another system recently advertised, and presently in commercial production, can
store 30,000,000 documents in micro-image in the space of an ordinary file cabinet.49
Within one minute, this system can locate and produce a black and white hard copy
of any page in the file.
The storage of documents in micro-image form has many advantages besides
saving space. The documents are preserved intact and the wear and tear of handling
and use that is inevitable in an ordinary library is avoided. Perhaps most important,
the documents are not lost, stolen, or misplaced, but remain constantly available.
The ability to reproduce desired portions of the documents easily eliminates
any substantial disadvantage, and .may offer a significant advantage, at least for
reference material. It seems likely that the duplicating, rather than the circulating,
library is the library of the future.80 The storage, retrieval, and reproduction techniques
now available for use with microdocuments indicate that the storage problem
has been, or can readily be, solved. However, this manner of storage precludes any
practical method of direct searching of the text and therefore requires retrieval by
accession number, necessitating an independent indexing system. So it appears that
indexing or abstracting, or both, will continue to be an integral part of future
systems for handling large volumes of data.

B. Indexing and Abstracting Problems

The techniques for manipulating index terms and matching request terms to
index terms are certainly capable of further development and refinement. Nevertheless,
the work that has already been done suggests that there are known techniques
which will produce reasonably satisfactory results, and that, in any event, the

capabilities of present equipment permit modification and improvement of these

processes within an established and operating system. The greatest problem now
apparent in the field is that of establishing adequate clues to document contents by
indexing or abstracting. These procedures are still done manually in all present
operating systems, although some provocative experiments have been performed with
automatic indexing and abstracting.
On first impression the task of indexing or abstracting may appear to be one
requiring the exercise of human intelligence and therefore beyond the range of
automation. However, communication and information have been subject to
mathematical analysis for more than a decade,"' and there are some techniques for
mathematical "content analysis" of meaning. 2 All such objective techniques arise
from the fact that "meaning per se is not negotiable for purposes of communication,
except by means of arbitrary physical tokens such as the spoken or the written
word."' It is quite possible, although difficult, to manipulate and analyze objectively
the objective manifestations of meaning-both the discrete symbols constituting
words and the complex patterns constituting syntax and even style."4 It has been
remarked that the semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering
aspects, but this does not mean that engineering aspects are necessarily irrelevant
to the semantic aspects06
To illustrate by a simple example, the meaning of the messages that are to be
carried is of no significance to the problem of constructing an efficient telephone
system. On the other hand, the efficiency of the telephone system is indispensable
to the communication of meaningful messages by telephone, and an inefficient
system or a "bad" connection can result in a garbled message or wholly prevent
communication. Similarly, automatic indexing- experiments are based upon the
thesis that statistics on the kind, frequency, location, order, and arrangement of
words are adequate to make reasonably good predictions about the subject matter
(i.e., appropriate classification for library purposes) of documents containing those
words0 8 It is not necessary to know the significance of an individual word to a
writer or reader in order to establish its value in conveying information or acting
as a clue for document retrieval. Thus it may reasonably be assumed that a writer
will use terms bearing on his special topic with greater frequency than those which
do not.

However, mere frequency of use within a document is not a valid indication of
content, since the most frequently used words are general terms (like "important")
and logical connectives (like "and," "if," "but," "all," "the," and "an"). In fact,
a substantial part of any message may be disregarded for purposes of information
theory analysis. Only about fifty per cent of the words in a message are determined
by the free choice of the sender, the other fifty per cent being determined by the
accepted rules governing the use of symbols or the structure of language; so that
one-half of every ordinary message is redundant in the sense of being unnecessary
to complete the sense of the message.58 By general information theory, the amount
of information conveyed by a word should vary inversely, rather than directly, with
its frequency of usage, since infrequency evidences greater selectivity in its choice59
It is the rare, special, or technical word that will indicate most strongly the subject
of an author's discussion. However, the frequency referred to here is frequency in
general usage, not within a particular document.
This has led to the formulation of the "relative frequency technique" as a method
of automatic indexing. 0 This uses the ratio between the frequency of a word's
occurrence in a particular document and the frequency of its general use to measure
the significance of the word as an indicator of the contents of the document. The
matrix for the determination of general frequency may be the literature of the
language generally, a broad field of interest, such as law, or a special field of interest,
such as antitrust law. Not enough work has been done to establish the utility of
the several alternative matrices or ratio measures, but subjective judgment suggests
that the use of a special field matrix will be both more practical and more informative.
Refinements of this technique may involve attaching weights to the position of
occurrence of words; for example, giving more weight to an occurrence in the
tide, first paragraph, or summary and conclusion than in some other part of an
article. Further, this technique is capable of establishing a statistically weighted
connection between a given word and the contents of a document, in order to provide
the foundation for probabilistic, or comparative relevance, indexing.
The methods of automatic abstracting are essentially similar to those of automatic
indexing. Some relatively simple expedients have been suggested, such as extracting
the first and last paragraphs of a document, or taking the first sentence of each
paragraph or of every other paragraph. These do not appear to be satisfactory,
however, and more refined and sophisticated techniques are undoubtedly required.
When such simple and relatively mechanical techniques are rejected, the problem
of automatic abstracting becomes essentially the same as the problem of automatic
indexing. Once it becomes possible to determine statistically the significant words
in a document, an abstract can be similarly constructed statistically by determining

the relative significance of sentences. Sentences may be considered significant if
they contain single words having a specified significance value or'if they contain a
plurality of words having a specified aggregate significance value. Then such
sentences, together with so much of the context as is found. necessary to.make them
usefully readable (as, perhaps, the sentence preceding and the sentence succeeding
each significant sentence), may be extracted from the document to form the abstract.
To those who are concerned about the intellectual .quality of an abstract produced
automatically, the words of working scientists in the field may be instructive:1

Any technique for automatic abstracting will, ultimately, succeed or fail according as the
author of the document being abstracted succeeds or fails in expressing his thoughts clearly
in the document. One cannot put: more into an automatic abstract than the author of
the document provides. This dependence may actually turn out to be an advantage,
for automatic abstracts, will rcycal the poverty or richness of a, document .without either
disguise or embellishment; whereas conventional abstracts sometimes make a document
appear more valuable than it really is and are liable to subconscious biases and misunderStanding
ont the part of'flie human abstracter. One may even hope that when, inevitably,
automatic abstracting-becomes widely used, it will tend to induce authors to set forth
more -clearly-anpd.explicitly'the main points of their articles.

scope of the work being done in the field and its possibilities. While major interest
naturally centers on problems of indexing, abstracting, storing, and retrieving textual
matter such as court decisions, briefs, memoranda and similar material, this is by
no means the limit of application. On the contrary, the techniques of automatic
data processing have been and are being successfully applied to such legal problems
as the filing of annual corporation reports; 2 the filing and retrieval of chemical
patents;03 trademark searches;64 the manipulation of large accumulations of evidence
in a "big case"; 65 storage and retrieval of real estate title records;0 6 record keeping

klecting retiirns for detailed audit;6 7 and the compilation and analysis of identical
bidding reports by the Department of JtusticeYs These techniques are- more widely
used, .both in and out of government, for the handling of technical.information not
directly related to law." Such technical information does, of course,become relevant
to law when legal investigation or litigation touches technical fields. Accordingly,
the Department of Justice has established liaison with both ASTIA (the Armed
Services. Technical Information Agency) and NASA so that abstracts and bibliographies
on a wide variety of technical subjects can readily be secured by lawyers
concerned with those subjects 0
The advantages of automated data retrieval are so great that there is a tendency
to view these developments principally in terms of convenience, speed, economy, and
efficiency,7 although thought may also be given to some of the legal problems involved
in widespread computer employment, such as the effect upon traditional
notions of negligence and the shopbook rule7 2 Certainly these are important considerations.
But they should not wholly obscure the broader implications of the new
technology. There are at least two fundamental differences between the electronic
computers now available and devices (such as calculating machines) which preceded
them. First and foremost, the new computers can be internally programmed
to duplicate or simulate such important psychological functions as remembering,
forgetting, analyzing, differentiating, deciding and pursuing other goal-directed
activities.73 Secondly, the new computers have the ability to. manipulate nonhumerical
information, including words and the abstract symbols of mathematical
logic 4
' The computers have just one inescapable theoretical limitation: every term
and operation must be made explicit and nothing can be presumed, assumed, implied,
or based on intuitionY' The computers can handle all symbols and programs that

LAW AND CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS

are completely explicated. In other words, the computers can do anything we tell
them to do; their only absolute limitation is our ability to provide instructions.
Even this limitation has uses, for it permits us to test the clarity and consistency
of our own thought and expression. This can be done for large numbers of similar
cases by computer programming. It can be done more efficiently for individual cases
by using the intellectual model or analogue of a computer, symbolic logic. This
is a far more flexible and powerful intellectual tool than syllogistic logic, and is
adapted to detecting ambiguities and inconsistencies and determining validity or
invalidity in complex problems of logic, expression and communication. 0 Any
operation that can be performed on a computer can be expressed in modern logic;
and any operation that can be expressed in modern logic can be performed on a
computer. The basic elements that these procedures have in common are explication,
model-making (or operational organization or programming), and the production
of a testable conclusion. These elements carry us beyond the subject matter
that either computers or symbolic logic ordinarily work with and into the broad field
of scientific research generally on social problems.
The yearning for a "scientific" answer to legal problems, as noted at the beginning,
is an old one. The great Cardozo cried for a "table of logarithms" to produce "the
formula of justice.""" What we are learning is that the logarithms and other mathematical
formulae are available-not to produce a "formula of justice," but only more
modestly to answer specific questions by programmed operations. If questions
are properly put to science by the law, sensible answers can be secured. The field
of behavioral -science is far too broad today to review briefly, but examples of particular
pertinence to law abound.
Four examples of behavioral science research methods have recently been reported
from the Jury Project of the University of Chicago Law School.18 One question
asked was: What, if any, difference is there between the way a judge and a jury
decide the same case? The method adopted was to ask the presiding judge in a
large number of jury cases to answer a questionnaire before the jury verdict was
returned, stating how he would have decided the case. The judges' answers and
the jury verdicts were then compared. The results of this inquiry showed that judges
and juries agreed in eighty per cent of the cases, that in eighteen per cent the jury
acquitted where the judge would have convicted, and that in only two per cent
did the jury convict where the judge would have acquitted.70

Another question was whether there was a greater tendency for people to file
claims in some cities of the United States than in others. The investigation was
made by a statistical study of claims filed with a cross section group of insurance
companies arising out of automobile accidents and accidents in department and
chain stores. The analysis produced a fairly consistent rank order of cities with
Philadelphia emerging as the most "claim conscious" and Detroit as the least. A
related question was whether juries in some regions or cities give higher awards in
comparable tort cases than in other regions or cities. After analyzing a number of
difficulties in establishing comparability, the experimenters secured detailed written
descriptions of five personal injury cases. These were then presented to a large
number of experienced insurance adjusters, each of whom was asked to estimate
the jury verdict that would be expected from a jury in his locality for that case.
The results indicated reliable regional variations, with estimated jury awards being
about eighty per cent of the national average in the rural south and midwest and
about iao per cent of the national average in the metropolitan east and west coasts.
Another experiment was designed to determine what effect the formulation-of
the legal rule as to the defense of insanity in criminal cases actually has on jury
verdicts. A mock trial based on the real Durham case was tape recorded, with all
parts of the trial included from the judge's opening statement to the final instructions.
Three recorded versions were produced that were identical except for the instructions
to the jury. In one version the instructions were based on the M'Naghten rule, in a
second version on the Durham rule, and in the third version no instructions on-the
subject were given. Juries were selected by lot from the actual jury pools of three
metropolitan areas, and were presented with the recorded trial, followed by the same
opportunity to deliberate and reach a verdict as in a real trial. The results of this
experiment are yet to be published. The point of significance here is not that any
particular investigation was made, or results secured, but rather that the problems
of law are subject to investigation by the construction and operation of experimental
models.80
Computer techniques and applications seem to have attracted more attention,
both from the technicians and the general public, than scientific theory and investigation
of other kinds in the behavioral field. One of the reasons obviously is that
the problem of data retrieval is so pervasive that automated data retrieval systems
will have very wide utility. However, there are other problems of law that are
almost, if not quite, as general as that of data retrieval. One of these is that of
determining the reliability and credibility of testimony. Attention was first called to

this problem and to the possibility of its scientific investigation by the classic statement
of Miinsterberg more than half a century ago.8' Some scientific work has been
done in the field since that time, principally focused on the detection of deception,82
but the basic problem still remains and awaits interdisciplinary and scientific investigation.
3
Another problem of great generality and deep interest among lawyers is that
of predicting judicial decisions. Recent work (some of it reported in other articles
in the present symposium) has made it evident that this problem too, if presented
in properly posed questions, is amenable to scientific investigation8 4 Two aspects
certainly seem beyond question. First, as the methods of securing, indexing and
retrieving legal data improve, it will become more likely that lawyers and judges
faced with a given case will at least have the same legal precedents and principles
at hand from which to begin their consideration. This will tend to give the lawyer
somewhat greater assurance in forecasting the judicial decision than if he must take
account of the possibility that the judge has discovered a different set of precedents
than the lawyer was aware of when presenting the case. In the second place, if
lawyers are to deal intelligently and effectively with scientific data-regarding judicial
behavior or anything else-they must have at least some understanding of the
intellectual framework of science, particularly mathematical expression, statistical
measures and probability8 5 All of this is merely to say that jurimetrics is now
pr."actical, and that in the near future, its study will probably become essential for
the individual lawyer.
Certainly the approach that has been characterized as jurimetrics does not offer
any social panaceas. Essentially, it involves putting a series of questions that are
capable of investigation to the test of investigation. It seeks not sudden revelations
or universal laws but the slow accretion of tested information. It seeks to apply to
legal problems "the same humble, honest objective approach that has characterized
the development of science" in other fields!' Jurimetrics does not seek to oust

jurisprudence, philosophy, or faith from men's lives. These, too, have their place.
There will always be assumptions and choices to be made by the free spirit of a man,
and no scientific operation or test can ever properly make or constrain such choices.
Fears for the dangers of a "mechanized jurisprudence" are both quixotic and uncomprehending.
Jurimetrics is not concerned with a debate as to whether the
metaphorical life of the law has been logic or experience. Jurimetrics is concerned
only with investigating the structure and dimensions of all experience that is relevant
to the law.
