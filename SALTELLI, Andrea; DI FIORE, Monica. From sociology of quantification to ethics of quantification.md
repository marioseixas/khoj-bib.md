From sociology of quantification to ethics
of quantification

Andrea Saltelli 1✉ & Monica Di Fiore 2✉

Quantifications are produced by several disciplinary houses in a myriad of different styles.
The concerns about unethical use of algorithms, unintended consequences of metrics, as well
as the warning about statistical and mathematical malpractices are all part of a general
malaise, symptoms of our tight addiction to quantification. What problems are shared by all
these instances of quantification? After reviewing existing concerns about different domains,
the present perspective article illustrates the need and the urgency for an encompassing
ethics of quantification. The difficulties to discipline the existing regime of numerification are
addressed; obstacles and lock-ins are identified. Finally, indications for policies for different
actors are suggested.

Give me a number!

Numbers, visible and invisible, pervade our life, dominate
the language of our communication, and accelerate all our
transactions. What price is being paid?

At the time of writing the present work, uncertainty, precaution,
and governance are the keywords describing how
COVID-19 emergency is challenging political questions of
security and health in the era of big data. In this context, numbers
are very much in demand, and expected from science.
According to The New York Times (Landler and Castle, 2020)
the report which purportedly “jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to
Action”, from the Imperial College in London (Ferguson et al.,
2020), warned about the possibility of 510,000 deaths in Britain
and 2.2 million in the US. How could such a two-digit precision
be obtained? Known uncertainties include the prevalence of the
virus in the population; the number of asymptomatic cases and
their infectiveness; the behaviour and resilience of acquired
immunity; the way the flue will react to the oncoming summer
and to the next winter; the time needed to make a vaccine globally
available; how the emergency will affect non-COVID patients,
and how individuals will adapt their behaviour to the new
situation and containment measures.
The report from the Imperial College explains that the calculation
corresponds to the do-nothing scenario, and comes from a
model described in a Nature paper (Ferguson et al., 2006b) and
associated online supplementary information (Ferguson et al.,
2006a). The uncertainty in the prediction was assessed moving
just one uncertain factor, a strategy bound to grossly underestimate
the uncertainty when the model is nonlinear and nonadditive
(Saltelli and Annoni, 2010; Saltelli et al., 2019), as is likely
the case for epidemiological models, due to the exponential term
(s) in the equation.
An intense debate in the media (Steerpike, 2020; Fund, 2020)
and social media1 ensued about the scarce transparency of the
Imperial College model, and its previous performance in the case
of the BSE and foot and mouth disease documented in Mansley
et al. (2011) and Kitching et al. (2006).
As noted, more realistically, by Anthony Fauci—a member of
the White House Coronavirus Task Force at the time of this
work, in his reply to a politician insisting for a number of deaths,
“There is no ‘number-answer’ to your question” (Fauci, 2020).
Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Yaneer Bar-Yam go further in their
indictment of poor use of mathematical modelling in the context
of the UK pandemic experience, suggesting that modelling and
policy making are two sources of error in the UK action. They
note that “[I]f we base our pandemic response plans on flawed
academic models, people die” (Taleb and Bar-Yam, 2020). The
subject of modelling work for COVID-19 was the subject of
several commentaries (Rhodes and Lancaster, 2020; Pielke, 2020),
including one involving the authors of this work in the journal
Nature (Saltelli et al., 2020a). Here we stressed that modelling is a
social activity and that more inclusive societal negotiations are
needed in the framing of these mathematical objects.
The pandemic shows how numbers and their uncertainty—if
not properly mastered—may play a dysfunctional role at the
science policy interface (Saltelli et al., 2020a; Bradshaw and
Borchers, 2000).
The pandemic has also shown that the act of quantifying, either
by a model or by an algorithm, increasingly nourishes the
science–policy interface with the opportunity to outsource
decision-making authority to number-based decision-making
(Danaher et al., 2017), when momentous political decisions are
delegated to the purported neutrality of model generated numbers
(Saltelli et al., 2020a).

There is, therefore, a circularity between numbers, models,
algorithms and the interface between science and politics. In this
perspective, the last decade has seen a growing critical thinking
about a crisis in the workings of science—the so-called reproducibility
crisis (Saltelli and Funtowicz, 2017; Saltelli, 2018). One
of the many dimensions of this crisis is related to its ethical
dimension, in the relationship between poor reproducibility and a
perverse system of incentives (Smaldino and McElreath, 2016;
Edwards and Roy, 2017). A sectors hit by the reproducibility
crisis, and the first where the alarm was sounded (Begley and
Ellis, 2012), is that of biomedical research (Harris, 2017; Ioannidis,
2005, 2016), already affected by a collapse in trust (Goldacre,
2012). This should be borne in mind now that the world
waits for a COVID-19 vaccine.
Connecting this growing critical thought about scientific problems
to ethics of quantification shows that a multitude of
unintended effects, lock-ins and path dependencies, are worth
paying attention to.
If one reads the present context with the lenses of social system
theory, then one can take the mediatisation of science (Scheufele,
2014), its commodification (Mirowski, 2011) and politicisation
(Pielke Jr, 2007)—as a consequence of the structural coupling of
different systems—economy, science, media, policy. As per this
theory, due to the German sociologist Niklas Luhmann (Moeller,
2006; Luhmann, 1995), each system communicates using its own
code, true/false for science, profit/loss for the economy, new/nonews
for the media and so on. For the authors in (Saltelli and
Boulanger, 2019), society is confronted with a situation where
science’s code true/false is corrupted by those of the other systems,
such as profit/loss, news/no-news, and finally by that of
technology: functions/does not-function. In this scenario media’s
appetite for quantified information accelerates a process of pervasive
quantification, intended both as the production of more
numbers, and the use of more algorithms in the social media.
As noted in Saltelli (2020), finding commonalities in the
undesired aspects of different forms of quantification can help
chart the problem, and bring some perspective to scholars
involved in different aspects of this discussion.

Numbers, models, algorithms, how different, how similar

What qualities are specific to rankings, or indicators, or
models, or algorithms? What does quantification share with
related concepts like commensuration or categorization?
(Popp Berman and Hirschman, 2018)
As algorithms and Big Data populate ever more deeply our life,
following the evolution of what has been variously called platform
capitalism (Lanier, 2006) or surveillance capitalism (Zuboff,
2019), decisions arrived at by computation may come to pose
important societal threats (O’Neil, 2016).
Quantifications seem to be the leading language used to deal
with and solve different aspect of social and political life, even
when this dissolves the meaningfulness of the number themselves,
as when the news about the pandemic reports number of deaths,
or worse of infected people, with the unbelievable precision of
three, four, even five significant digits.
It becomes hence urgent for society to develop a better
understanding of, adaptation to and defence from, a pervasive
datafication. The exigency of policy to achieve efficiency and
certainty through the instrument of quantification should be kept
under societal control, lest the complexity of models, algorithms
or rankings becomes an end to itself, used instrumentally to
transform political problems into technical ones. It might be that
the new, post-pandemic normal, will have to include a new
maturity in the relationship between numbers and society.

It must be stressed here that there are different quantification
tools and methods with distinguished social, political and economic
impact: an algorithm embedding prejudices is different
from a poorly designed statistical analysis, from a mathematical
model predicting the unpredictable, or from the pervasive ranking
of countries, cities or universities. Inequality embedded in
algorithm may affect members of minority groups (ethnic, racial,
sexual, disability-related, etc.) (Danaher et al., 2017), with a long
chain of impacts. A biased algorithm can inflict longer sentences
to coloured people or simply to people living in a poor neighbourhood
(O’Neil, 2016; Muller, 2018). A poorly designed statistical
analysis for medical treatments could squander billions
and kill thousands (Harris, 2017). Poor modelling may lead to
wrong, or simply unjustified, political choices (Saltelli, 2019;
Saltelli et al., 2020a, 2020b). The proliferation of rankings of
universities has profoundly altered higher education, making it
into a global market and dramatically increasing prices for students
and their families (O’Neil, 2016; Muller, 2018). The list of
examples could continue (Saltelli, 2020). Still, as argued in this
work, the diversity in the various families of quantification hides
important commonalities.
It should also be stressed that a list of perverse quantification
can be contrasted with a list of virtuous ones. These come most
often from the field of physics than from the more complex fields
of medicine or social sciences. Thanks to clever modelling NASA
scientists could position around Mercury the probe MESSENGER,
launched in 2004, after five billions miles and six ½ years
(Kay and King, 2020).
Models for weather forecast are an example where a mutual
process of domestication has taken place between models and
society. By producing useful short-term predictions constantly
updated by new information, and by communicating uncertainty
carefully, these models make it normal for us to read on our
mobile that tomorrow will be mostly sunny with a 20 per cent
chance of rain (Lazo et al., 2009). From agriculture to transport to
energy, virtually all sectors of the economy benefit from these
models (Sarewitz et al., 2000). Weather forecasts become controversial
only under condition of extreme political interference,
as shown by the recent story of hurricane Dorian in the US (Law
and Martinez, 2020), or when high-stakes events, such as storms
or flooding, complexify the transmission from the technical
knowledge of meteorologists to the takers of momentous political
decisions, such as e.g., evacuation for coastlines or cities (Sarewitz
et al., 2000; Pielke et al., 2002). Hurricanes and pandemics are
situations “when facts are uncertain, stakes high, values in dispute
and decisions urgent”, according to the mantra of post-normal
science (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1993). COVID-19 illustrates
perfectly the mutated conditions of operation of science when
moved from the normal to the post-normal regime (WaltnerToews
et al., 2020); under these circumstances, when models
impact directly societal decisions, their use needs better political
and societal coping strategies (Saltelli et al., 2020a).
Sheila Jasanoff, identifies two opposing classes of modelling:
‘technologies of hubris’ and ‘technologies of humility’ (Jasanoff,
2003). Developed to reassure the public, and “to keep the wheels
of science and industry turning”, the technologies of hubris
include quantifications such as risk assessment and cost benefit
analysis whose purpose is to promise a chance of management
and control, even in areas of great uncertainty such as climate
change. The promise is reinforced by claims of neutrality, rigour
and objectivity, but these come, for Jasanoff, with important
limitations, i.e., in generating overconfidence thanks to the
appearance of exhaustivity, pre-empting political discussion of
what remain outside these quantifications, and remaining limited
in the capacity of these technologies to internalise challenges that
arise outside their framing assumptions. All these remarks have

been vindicated—in the opinion of the authors of this work—by
the numbers populating the present pandemic (Saltelli et al.,
2020a). Calls for humility in relation to using mathematical
model (Sridhar and Majumder, 2020) come with disputes where
models become the target of political attack (Pielke, 2020). Some
authors (Rhodes and Lancaster, 2020) speak of “mathematical
models as public troubles”.
Adopting “technologies of humility” (Jasanoff, 2007) would
entail to reflect on the sources of ambiguity, indeterminacy and
complexity, to bring out the ethical dimensions of problems, and
to identify winners and losers in the distributions of costs and
benefits—focusing on the most vulnerable. Most importantly, for
Jasanoff (Jasanoff, 2003), society should identify those factors
which either deter or encourage learning.
It is perhaps useful to note that the aspects of quantification
which might be called hubristic enjoy in our society an privileged
status and popularity, suffice to consider the role of intellectuals
such as Cass Sunstein (Matthews, 2018), and Steven Pinker
(Pinker, 2018). The Panglossian numbers of the latter reassure us
that all is well (Gray, 2018), while the cost benefit analyses and
nudging of the former ensure that—once society is given the right
facts, in numerical form, disagreement will dematerialise, as “the
issues that most divide us are fundamentally about facts rather
than values” (Matthews, 2018). For example, in relation to
COVID-19, the Washington Post notes (Frankel, 2020) that if we
adopt a cost-benefit analysis using as a yardstick concepts such as
the value of a statistical life (VSL, see later in the present work),
this would force society to confront reality in a more precise way;
the alternative to using these tools, admonish the Washington
Post, is to be left to gut feelings, educated guesses or political
arguments (Frankel, 2020).

A fragmented landscape

Quantifications are produced by several disciplinary houses
in a myriad of different styles. What problems are shared by
all these?
How, where and what is quantified? From education to finance,
from criminal justice to global governance, from the economy to
the environment, all fields are colonised by numbers. Mathematical
and statistical models, indicators, metrics and algorithms of
various nature and complexity are used to maximise efficiency, to
measure profit, sustainability, decarbonisation, the achievement
of objectives, the ratings of cities or restaurants. They can give a
price to financial products which only initiates can understand
(Porter, 2012), and which have the power to collapse the economy
(Wilmott and Orrell, 2017; Salmon, 2009).
For some scholars, humanity is now “entering an era of
widespread algorithmic governance” (Kitchin, 2017). Speed, efficiency,
comprehensiveness and fairness are some positive properties
invoked in favour of algorithmic governance. At the same
time, this increasing complexity of algorithms comes in the form
of black boxes (Danaher et al., 2017), where clarity is sacrificed,
because although algorithms have the power to act upon data and
make decisions, they are largely beyond query or question
(Kitchin, 2017; O’Neil, 2016), thus foregoing the properties of
comprehensiveness and fairness.
What kind of ethical reflection is going on these topics? Indeed,
a lot, though in a fragmented landscape.
● Ethics of AI has become a field of its own, with both a rich
literature, institutional initiatives (High-Level Expert Group
on Artificial Intelligence, 2019), including from the Holy See
(Copestake, 2019). ● In the discipline of statistics the community is moored in an
internal ‘statistics war’ about the fundamental concepts to be

used or taught (Gelman, 2019). ● Abuse and misuse of metrics—from the Goodhart’s law to our
days, is also a field with a long tradition of investigation
(Muller, 2018). ● In mathematical modelling the situation is at the same richer
and more confused, owing to mathematical modelling not
being a discipline (Saltelli, 2019; Saltelli et al., 2020a). ● Rankings, inferences, decisions, are all different output of
these activities, which in some cases do not even bring to the
surface a number. Yet these are all instances of quantification.
Wendy Espeland and Mitchell Stevens (Espeland and Stevens,
2008) draw attention to the spread of quantification and the
significance of new regimes of measurement, where democracy,
merit, participation, accountability and even “fairness” are to be
discovered and appreciated via numbers. These authors investigate
five key dimensions of quantification

● the work it requires, e.g., in relation to the need for “wellfunded
bureaucracies with highly trained administrators”; ● its reactivity, in that “turning qualities into quantities creates
new things and new relations among things”; ● its tendency to discipline human behaviour, e.g., by practices
which define what is appropriate, normal; ● its polyvalent authority, in that quantitative authority confer
epistemic authority, and ultimately power (Porter, 1995); ● its aesthetics, in relation to the craft skills and evolving
fashions related to making numbers compelling, and in a
sense, beautiful.
The authors conclude with the pressing recommendation to
move from a sociology of quantification to an ethics of numbers.
This descends from the realisation that quantification is fundamentally
a social activity, and for this its ethical implications
should be considered explicitly and transparently.
While sociology of quantification has received a considerable
boost in the last decade – see the review in Popp Berman and
Hirschman (2018), ethics of quantification is still fragmented in
different realms of quantification.
The COVID-19 pandemic offers perhaps the appropriate
moment for this discussion, now that the discussion about
COVID-19 is formulated in the jargon of mathematics and
models (Rhodes et al., 2020), with expression such as ‘flatten the
curve’ entering into everyday language.
Said otherwise, the present moment of intense reciprocal
domestication between society and the numbers of the pandemic
may bring us closer to the mature use of quantification exemplified
above for the case of weather predictions.

Concerned readings: who is alarmed?

Voices of concern about different aspects of quantification

As noted by Cathy O’Neil (O’Neil, 2016), one deplorable use of
algorithms/mathematics in the guise of operational research, is
making labour conditions harder, by a scheduling which optimises
the employer benefits. She mentions ‘clopening’, the
practice whereby the same worker is responsible for closing a
public exercise in the night and open it in the morning, and how
these practices make it impossible for an employee to plan care
for children and elderly, for studying, for having a life.
Similar, and possibly more drastic conclusions are reached by
Alain Supiot (Supiot, 2007), a jurist, for whom the numerification
of society has created a system where algorithms replace laws, and
the labour market has transformed from Taylorian—where the
labourers sold to the employers hours of labour—to cybernetic,
whereby thanks to the governing by objective, the mobilisation of
the workers is total, in a homoeostatic system where their

performance is constantly measured. In this system, argues
Supiot, any possibility of appeal and negotiation is lost, the law
loses its heteronomy, human solidarity is eroded, as the fellow
worker becomes a competitor, and the individual is left to seek
the protection of the more powerful in order to survive; in other
words, a re-feudalisation of society.
A complementary reading of the situation is offered by the
French movement of ‘statactivistes’ (Bruno et al., 2014), which
reconnects to a rich tradition of sociology of numbers (Pierre
Bourdieu, Alain Desrosieres) to fight numbers with numbers
under the slogan ‘another number is possible’. As shown by the
many compelling examples in the book and articles of the statactivistes
(Bruno et al., 2014; Bruno et al., 2014) the fight against
a dystopian use of quantification is not the end of quantification,
but its correct use disciplined by just laws. The rich repertoire of
strategies deployed by the statactivistes includes ‘statistical judo’, a
technique of self-defence against invasive measures of performance.
Statactivistes also demonstrate examples of how unjust
metrics can be deconstructed and replaced with a fairer one—e.g.,
in the measurement of poverty (Concialdi, 2014), and how hidden
pathologies of society can be detected by statisticians—dramatic
the example of suicides at France Telecom as a result of a
drastic restructuring of the company, see also the discussion in
Saltelli (2020).
At Cardiff University in the UK, a Data Justice Lab examines
the relationship between datafication and social justice, investigating
the politics and the consequences of big data and datadriven
processes (Cardiff University, 2020). An International
Research Network named “Society for the Social Studies of
Quantification (SSSQ)” has been recently created, gathering
scholars from disciplines such as history, philosophy, sociology,
anthropology and political science (Didier, 2020b).
Other virtuous examples of data activism are described by O’Neil
(O’Neil, 2016), pp. 91–92, where ‘Hackathons’ are the occasion for
the opening of the black box of algorithms, to detect embedded
racial prejudice, e.g., in the software used by the police. Other
relevant example of activism are models to combat gerrymandering
in the US, and to defend in the wider world the integrity of the
voting process in elections (Lindeman and Stark, 2012).
A form of societal activism on the relation between models and
society is offered by Tomas Pueyo, not an epidemiologist, who
maintains a blog for COVID-19 epidemiological models and
explains in plain-language the implications of model uncertainties
for policy options (Pueyo, 2020), along the lines of ‘modelling as a
social activity’ discussed in (Saltelli et al., 2020b).

Reasons for an ethics of quantification

Why does society need an encompassing ethics of
quantification? Why it is urgent now?
As noted above, for Espeland and Stevens (Espeland and Stevens,
2008) a sociology and an ethics of numbers is needed due to
the spread of quantification and the significance of new regimes
of measurement. In a previous work from one of the authors
(Saltelli, 2020) the case for an ethics of quantification (EoQ) is
made as follows:
● An ethics of quantification is needed because of the symbiotic
relationship between quantification and trust (Porter, 1995). ● It is a defence against statistical abuses perpetrated by public
or private actors (Bruno et al., 2014). ● It can oppose consequentialism in scientific quantification—
meaning by this the instrumental production of numbers just
because there is a cause or an audience to serve, irrespective of
the numbers’ quality. Consequentialism is typically associated
with an optimistic view of how the ‘good’ can be neatly

computed (Saltelli, 2020), and with the ‘modelling hubris’
often met in quantitative studies (Saltelli, 2019; Saltelli et al.,
2020a). ● It helps to apportion responsibilities and to act on them when
metrics produce unintended or otherwise undesirable effects
(O’Neil, 2016; Muller, 2018). ● An ethics of quantification can assist in realising that “The
technique is never neutral” (Saltelli et al., 2020), meaning by
this that the outcome of a policy study can be decided in
advance just by the choice of the experts and disciplines called
to adjudicate it (Beck, 1992). An important instance of this is
when a political issue is presented/transformed into a
technical one (Ravetz, 1971). Thus, an ethics of quantification
can help to make the relationship between a quantification
and the associated context and purpose more stringent
(Zyphur and Pierides, 2017). ● The fragmented nature of ethics efforts in different disciplines
discussed above calls for an encompassing ethical effort.
To this list, a more general concern can be added for the way
numerification may change the nature of a discipline. The point
has been made repeatedly for the mathematization of economics
(Reinert, 2000; Mirowski, 1991) and for sociology falling prey of
statistical rituals (Gigerenzer and Marewski, 2014).
For the authors in Sareen et al. (2020) the main reason to call
for an ethics of quantification is related to the two faces of
quantification: one of illumination and one of obfuscation. Social
actors producing quantification may strategically illuminate those
aspects that can be socially legitimated, while obfuscating those
that cannot. An example is the use of an AI assisted census to
purportedly increase the legitimacy of a biometricising governance
regime, while at the same time some citizens are not allowed
to register, becoming invisible. This is the case of the Aadhaar
system in India (Sareen et al., 2020).
This debate has become all the more urgent at the moment of
the pandemic. When a set of numbers – deaths and infections in
the present case, establish itself at the centre-stage, other possible
numbers and stories may be neglected, including the losses for the
more vulnerable economic subjects, the loss of rights such as that
to education, to health (for other than COVID-19 issues) and to
civil liberties (Didier, 2020a; Foucault et al., 2020).

Obstacles

Why the battle to discipline a pervasive datafication of the
world will be hard
A program such as one of increased attention to the ethics of
quantification is made arduous by a variety of factors. One is the
prevailing techno-optimistic paradigm, whereby normative bias
and controversy dissipate against the light of well-crafted quantification,
as argued by Cass Sunstein (Matthews, 2018), while for
Aaron Bastani (Bastani, 2019) the new era of big data and artificial
intelligence will present us with an era of abundance, a
“Fully Automated Luxury Capitalism”.
Related to the pandemic, while concepts such as value of a
statistical life are considered by many authors controversial even
within their ‘home’ in actuarial sciences, when applied in the
setting compensatory damages (Viscusi, 2008), e.g., in case of
airplane crashes (Linshi, 2015), they still have currency in global
socio-economic and health contexts. VSL are used in (Thunstrom
et al., 2020) to assert that social distancing in the US will lead to
net benefit of about $5.2 trillion. In spite of the apparent objectivity
of VSL, even within the administration of the United States,
different regulatory agencies use different values of VSL (Viscusi,
2008).

As an example of resistance to datafication, the addictive nature
of algorithms and AI in the new social media is denounced by
Jaron Lanier, who suggests to his readers that they should close all
their social accounts immediately (Danaher et al., 2017).
According to Rob Kitchin (Kitchin, 2017), algorithms create
capital, steer behaviour, identify people, and multiply themselves
in a growing web of applications. They hence represent nonneutral
practices corresponding to specific political economies
and cultures. The working of algorithms is thus not ‘apolitical’.
For Lucas Introna (Introna, 2016) the new regimes of quantification
allows a group of state and private actors to increase their
interconnectivity at the expenses of their subjects—be these
customers, consumers, citizens, migrants, tourists, suspects, students,
friends, colleagues, and many others. These considerations
suggest the existence and reinforcement of lock in and path
dependence processes.
Lock-in are also evident in many strands of occupation. As
researchers, the authors are well aware of the damage brought
about by the system of evaluation of research quality based on
metrics such as the impact factor or the Hirsh factor (Wilsdon,
2016); yet researchers can no more easily stop using these measures
than deans can stop checking the position of their departments
and universities in international rankings.
Whatever course society takes it will have to contend with the
pessimism of the Collingridge dilemma (Collingridge, 1980): it is
arduous to control a technology, as it is impossible to know in
advance its negative effects, and when the consequences become
evident, it might be too late to intervene.

Some emerging Implications for policy

What should be done?

Since the gist of this work is in the commonality of the issues
met in the different families of quantification, the authors do not
repeat in this section all the policy initiatives which are already
ongoing in existing fields where the discussion is more advanced,
as for example in the ethics of artificial intelligence and algorithms,
see a recent reviews in (Cath et al., 2018), (Lo Piano,
2020) or in the domain of official statistics, where codes of good
practices have existed for a long time.
The focus here is on the more general initiatives which could
be taken on numbers in general. Referring to AI the authors in
(Cath et al., 2018) note that “We are creating the digital world in
which future generations will spend most of their time”, and the
same can be said of the present pattern of datafication of
everyday life.
In this respect holistic approaches are needed. For Shoshana
Zuboff “If the digital future is to be our home, then it is we who
must make it so” (Zuboff, 2019), p. 21. Among our most urgent
tasks, for this author, is the “naming of the unprecedented”, i.e.,
to describe and draw attention of the singularity of the present
transition in the battle against what she calls surveillance capitalism.
There are surprising analogies between these sentiments
and those expressed by scholars of different orientation, from the
jurists (Supiot, 2007) to the data scientists (O’Neil, 2016) to the
Statactivistes (I. Bruno et al., 2014), to the historians (Muller,
2018; Porter, 2012), and many others.
Hence, the next sections describe a few suggestions for specific
actors.

Role of organised labour. If this will be a collective fight of ‘us
the people’, the role of unions and other social actors will be of
paramount importance. The example of the fight of the statactivistes
with the official French statistical institute INSEE to change

fight would not have been possible without the help from the
unions which put the problem on the table and assisted the statactivistes
in their battle. The COVID-19 pandemic offers to
organised labour a natural experiment about which workers fall
through the net of welfare systems, how to measure and compensate
the performance of all those workers who have made
social distancing possible (ILO, 2020), as well as to measure the
many ways in which the pandemic increase existing inequalities
(Macfarlane, 2020).

Role of institutions. For Zuboff, the need to fight the “unprecedented”
totalitarian ambitions of surveillance capitalism and its
attempt to dominate human nature implies the capacity for
society to discover that all is not well (Zuboff, 2019). While
Zuboff is quite accurate in the diagnosis of the challenge, she is in
general vague in her conclusions as to what actions this new
indignation should lead to (di Bella, 2019). In our opinion an
important ingredient in the battle of ideas she advocates is to give
civil society and institutions the means to source their evidence
independently to contrast the important devices of persuasion
and lobbing of surveillance capitalists. According to David
Michaels (Spencer, 2020), discussing how to contrast the power of
lobbies, “we need independent science paid for by the producers”,
meaning by this that part of the cost of this increased surveillance
(or anti-surveillance?) should be brought by those who needs to
be regulated—in this case the producers of opaque algorithms
and ratings. It is important to avoid the trap whereby “actors with
the deepest pockets can buy the science they need, frame issues
according to specific agendas and enforce these on the rest of
society” (Saltelli, 2018).
In order to tackle this important challenge to the future of our
societies the recipe of Lee Drutman (Drutman, 2015) is that of an
‘Office for Public Lobbying’. The idea would be to offer citizens
the same protection afforded to indigent defendants by the courts.
In this respect—in a US perspective, the US Office for
Technological Assessment (OTA) can be remembered. Eliminated
in 1995 by a conservative legislature (Chubin, 2001), it
offers a cautionary tale. “A moment’s thought brings to mind a
dozen or more subjects where an analytical agency like OTA
could be of use today”, notes Adam Keiper (Keiper, 2004) in
2004. In 2020, an OTA-like agency would not be without work.

Europe and the agenda for responsible research and innovation
(RRI). In Europe the movement of Responsible Research and
Innovation (RRI), part of the European Commission Horizon
2020 research strategy, has contributed to a reflection on the
‘right impacts’ of research, as well as on research’s governance,
responsiveness, integration and anticipation of the often unpredictable
consequences of science and technology (Owen et al.,
2012). RRI lists six policy keys that RRI should advance: ethics,
gender equality, governance, open access, public engagement, and
science education (European Commission, 2014). Perhaps a
seventh, responsible quantification, should be added to the list.

Ethics of quantification, in principles
If one were to explain, after the illustration above, what an ethics
of quantification consists of, one would be at loss to draw a
synthesis in the present multiverse of numbers. In the field of
statistics, in that of mathematical modelling, in those of algorithms
and ratings, a multitude of aspirations, agendas, and
interests are simultaneously at play. What can perhaps be suggested
here are a few principles which could be usefully followed
to move toward a more mature form of coexistence between
number and society.

● The multidimensionality of the “algorithms of public
relevance” (a definition due to (Gillespie, 2014)) points a
space of socio-political influence and public relevance of the
quantification, requiring a balancing movement that the
authors associate with an ethics of quantification. An ethics of
quantification as a framework to investigate the societal
relevance of quantification. ● Our analysis of the literature has focused on the cognitive
dissonance between possibly adverse impact of quantification,
and their purported function of universal certainty, neutrality,
and control. An ethics of quantification as vigilance about the
spoken and unspoken framing and assumptions. ● Quantification can belong to a culture of hubris or to one of
humility (Jasanoff, 2003). An ethics of quantification as
providing a compass to look at numbers along the humilityhubris
axis. ● The certainty of numbers and the neglect of ambiguity and
‘not-knowing’ (Gupta, 2001) may limit the space of the
possible policy solutions, or worse, it may offer to politics the
chance to abdicate decision by transforming a political
decision into a technical one, imposed by the certainty of
the quantitative prediction. An ethics of quantification for
systematically probing for missing numbers and blind spots. ● As mentioned in our perspective, both society and the
collective of quantifiers have a useful role to play in a context
of participation and activism. An ethics of quantification as
normative framework and intellectual home for various forms
of data-activism, model-activism and stat-activism. ● Quality of knowledge should be the primary tool helping to
map main dimensions of social, political and economic
phenomenon, overcoming knowledge asymmetries. Quality of
knowledge can be assisted by a process of socially mediated
quantification, with a role for forms of participative quality
(van der Sluijs et al., 2005; Saltelli et al., 2013). An ethics of
quantification for fostering quality as fitness for societal
purpose.
These principles are not new, and can be found in different
forms in different works concerned with e.g., mathematical
modelling (Saltelli, 2019) (Saltelli et al., 2020a), indicators (Engle
Merry, 2016), or algorithms (O’Neil, 2016).

Conclusions
This work has tried to emphasise commonalities among different
families of quantification, to stress that these commonalities were
not lost in the thought of the sociologists of numbers (Porter,
1995), and that the call these scholars made yesterday for an
ethics of quantification (Espeland and Stevens, 2008) become all
the more urgent today that societies live immersed in numbers,
including those of COVIDS-19, which are both visible (number of
deaths and infections) or invisible (social monitoring algorithms).
The magic power seduction of numbers (Engle Merry, 2016)
has increased enormously, including under the direction of
platform and surveillance capitalism. As a result, forms of societal
learning and coping have become at the same time more needed
and more difficult.
The present perspective article tried to capture the common
perspective that emerges from the authors’ reading of signals of
concern from existing literature, and to derive from these readings
the good reasons why we as citizens and scholars should act
now. An attempt has been made to show how asymmetries and
lock-ins stand in the way of a solution, especially since it is the
model of political decision itself which has been subtracted from
human agency and entrusted to the often-opaque logic of algorithms.
Finally, a few reflections for policy have been offered,

emphasising the collective need and responsibility for actions,
involving institutions, social actors, scholars and citizens.
