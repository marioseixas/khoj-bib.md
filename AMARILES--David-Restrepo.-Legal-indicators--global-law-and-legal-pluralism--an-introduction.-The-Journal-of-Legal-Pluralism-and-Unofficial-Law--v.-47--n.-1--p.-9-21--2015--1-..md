Legal indicators, global law and legal pluralism: an introduction

This article explores the development of legal metrics by focusing on the links
between legal indicators, global law and legal pluralism. In particular, it addresses the
question of the performative role that legal indicators convey in a situation of legal
pluralism in global law. First, I argue that indicators are not only a set of socio-legal
research methods conducted periodically and systematically with the aim of
describing the evolution of a socio-legal reality over time. From a pluralistic
perspective, indicators are also devices factually constraining the behaviour of
individuals and institutions at different geographical scales. I show that as legal
indicators become entrenched in managerial modes of governance, they adopt the role
of performance measures. As such, they bridge the factual, normative and behavioural
dimensions of social normativity. They rely on data gathering, benchmarking and
auditing practices to attempt framing legally relevant behaviour. Second, I argue that
legal indicators are triggering a mathematical turn in legal thinking, and so
transforming the analytical dimension of legal analysis. The mathematical reasoning
underpinning indicators increasingly attempts to supersede, in practice, linguistic and
conceptual modes of legal reasoning in the mission of constructing legal concepts,
relating them to one another and giving them sense in a specific context. In brief, this
article attempts to show that legal indicators are introducing to the legal field a set of
practices which are central to any contemporary approach to public and private
management, transforming en passant, the way we experience, see and think about
law in the context of globalisation.

1. Introduction

For the rational study of the law the black-letter man
may be the man of the present, but the man of the future
is the man of statistics and the master of economics. (Holmes 1897)

The number of legal metrics in the form of indicators, rankings and indexes is increasing
rapidly. According to a study of the French organisation Civil Law Initiative, until
the year 2000, only six sets of transnational indicators contained relevant information
about state legal systems, in comparison to more than 20 today (Restrepo-Amariles and
McLachlan 2015). But legal indicators are not only increasing in numbers. Recent sets of
indicators are also more refined, accessible and specialised. For instance, the Rule of Law
Index of the World Justice Project assesses societies against nine dimensions of the rule
of law, from which at least seven are distinctively legal (2014, 8)1
. When compared to
former generations of rule of law indicators, such as the World Bank’s Country Policy

These are constraints government powers, open government, fundamental rights, regulatory enforcement, civil
justice, criminal justice and informal justice.

and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rule-based governance rating and the Rule of Law
World Governance Indicator, the Rule of Law Index displays a more sophisticated understanding
of law as a social phenomenon and a more suitable methodological design. It
also confirms a trend to produce legal indicators as a category on its own. The trend
towards the production of specialised legal metrics is likely to continue for long enough
that their study seems both desirable and pressing for legal scholarship.
This special issue of the Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law aims to
explore the development of legal metrics by focusing on the links between legal indicators,
global law and legal pluralism. In particular, it addresses the question of the performative
role that legal indicators convey in a situation of legal pluralism in global law.
This enquiry follows up on the contributions and discussions triggered by the panel on
Instruments of Global Regulation: The Emergence of a Pluralist Global Law? hosted in
2013 by the Commission of Legal Pluralism during the 17th World Congress of the International
Union for Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences in Manchester.
To shed some light onto this question, contributors to this issue explore a variety of
normative devices, which directly or indirectly, rely on or associate with indicators used
and produced at national, regional and global scales, by both public and private organisations.
This article builds upon the analytical and conceptual framework laid down by
Frydman and Twining in the preface to propose a threefold analysis. First, it provides a
brief overview of key research initiatives in the field of legal indicators, their main claims
and central methodological premises. Second, it discusses Frydman’s pragmatic conception
of global law and its added value for the study of the performative role of indicators.
Finally, it introduces Twining’s idea of global perspective in jurisprudence to bring to
light two key transformations indicators are triggering in the legal field, namely, (1) a
mathematical turn and (2) the rise of managerial forms of legal reasoning.

2. Legal indicators: a developing field of legal studies

This special issue is intended to contribute to the emerging literature on indicators and
global law in socio-legal studies. It seeks to follow partly on the footsteps of the project
‘Studies in Law and Development’ (SLADE) conducted by Merryman and Friedman in
the 1970s at Stanford University, which is to my knowledge, the first significant sociolegal
research project in the field of legal indicators. SLADE sought to address the lack of
empirical evidence in the field of law and development by collecting systematic and comparable
information about law and social change in Latin America and Mediterranean
Europe (Merryman 2000, 713). After three years of research, they obtained 26 measurements
of different legal variables spanning a period of 25 years, from 1945 to 1970.
Empirical work relied mainly on fieldwork in each of the countries and on available
national and regional statistics.
Unfortunately, SLADE ran out of funding and the data collected remained mostly
unprocessed in a volume published in 1979 under the title Law and Social Change in
Mediterranean Europe and Latin America: A Handbook of Legal and Social Indicators
for Comparative Study (Merryman, Clark, and Friedman 1979). In spite of not accomplishing
data processing and analysis, SLADE left socio-legal scholars with two valuable
premises that, in my view, should underpin any serious research initiative in the field of
legal indicators.
First, researchers in SLADE argued that indicators were meant to complement, rather
than replace, traditional qualitative comparative legal research (Merryman 2000, 716).
Legal metrics may indeed contribute to a better understanding of certain legal questions,
but taken alone, they are as imperfect explanation of socio-legal phenomena as

10 D. Restrepo Amariles

Downloaded by [University of Otago] at 10:08 14 October 2015
are qualitative or conceptual research alone. Second, researchers in SLADE were aware of
the need to provide a context for data gathering, analysis and interpretation of results.
Hence, they included a qualitative variable to account for ‘legal culture’ in the hope it will
shed light on the quantitative variables measuring both ‘law’ and ‘development’ (Merryman
2000, 722724). Unfortunately, none of the current initiatives in the field of transnational
legal indicators includes a qualitative variable of legal context or legal culture.
Not surprisingly, studies with large-scale, socio-legal, quantitative and comparative
research designs aimed at the production of indicators have been rare since SLADE. These
studies are costly, imply a long-term focus, and require constant updates and highly specialised
interdisciplinary research teams to be relevant. Probably as a consequence of this, as
Twining pointed out at the beginning of the century, law remains strikingly absent as a significant
category from most of the general statistical literature, with the major exception of
crime statistics (Twining 2000, 154). However, Twining also highlighted that rankings and
indicators were flourishing on the back of the greater standardisation of data, and that some
were relevant from a legal perspective and producing considerable effects among its
addressees. For instance, he noted that league tables of universities and law schools in the
United States were having a disproportionate influence on alumni, university administrators,
employers, fund-raisers, donors and even faculty (Twining 2000, 163).
Moreover, Twining noted that international organisations, such as the World Bank,
were relying on indicators and rankings, most often rudimentary, to profiling legal systems
(Twining 2000, 157, 2009a, 289290). He argued that a ‘reflective approach to
evaluating the health of national legal systems, other legal orders or parts thereof may be
stimulated by even the cruder efforts at producing national rankings’ (Twining 2000,
164). In his view, ‘statistical tables and rankings involve comparison’ (Twining 2000,
165), and comparison in turn requires comparators, ‘that is standards or measures for
comparison’, which existing indicators lack (Twining 2000, 164). The lack of conceptual
sophistication of most existing legal indicators is hard to deny still today. But as Michaels
and Twining himself point out, legal scholars should not neglect them, despite their obvious
shortcomings and dubious assumptions.

2.1. Legal indicators: from comparative knowledge to global law

Legal scholars are increasingly interested in understanding the role legal metrics are playing
or are likely to play in legal scholarship and practice. For instance, Michaels has
argued that comparative law knowledge is falling behind other forms of comparative
knowledge, in part because it has neglected developments in the field of legal metrics,
including rankings and indicators (Michaels 2009, 767). In his view, the lack of a common
language of communication with other policy tools  most of which now make use
of performance indicators  may also make traditional comparative law knowledge
become obsolete for policymaking, legal reform and major political projects (Michaels
2009, 791795). Michaels is right in calling on comparative legal scholars to seize the
opportunity to confront their knowledge and methods of knowledge production with indicators
and rankings. This not only with the purpose of assessing the strengths and weaknesses
of their disciplinary approach, and if needed to update it, but also to ensure that
comparative law will continue to have a say in the production of comparative knowledge
with practical policy effects.
More recently, Davis (2007, 2005), Kingsbury, Kirsch, and Stewart (2005), and Merry
(2014, 2011) from New York University have taken on social indicators from the perspective
of global governance and global administrative law (Merry, Davis, and Kingsbury
2015; Davis, Kingsbury, and Merry 2012a, 2012b). They have mainly analysed social

The Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law 11

Downloaded by [University of Otago] at 10:08 14 October 2015
indicators in light of a Foucauldian interpretation of the knowledge-power relationship
to show ‘where, by whom and in relation to whom governance takes place’ (Davis,
Kingsbury, and Merry 2012a, 12). Davis et al. conclude that indicators are a technology
of global governance, i.e., a tool by means of which power is exercised within and beyond
states. As such, they go on to claim that their production and use need to be framed at a
global scale. Their proposal is to start by subjecting indicators to the procedural obligations
of global administrative law, which include transparency, participation and accountability
(Davis, Kingsbury, and Merry 2012a, 2021; Kingsbury, Kirsch, and Stewart
2005, 17).
At the Perelman Centre in Brussels, Frydman, I and co-workers have also analysed
indicators in the framework of global law and governance, but based on slightly different
methodological and theoretical premises. Following the ideas of legal pragmatism, we
attempt to bring to light the effects indicators are producing on the conduct of actors
including states, and to understand how they interact  i.e. compete, complement or
cooperate  with other devices of global regulation. When possible, we provide explanations
about how indicators may be shaping the transformation of law in our increasingly
globalised society (Frydman and Van Waeyenberge 2014).
For instance, Lewkowicz has recently argued that sovereign credit ratings attempt to
constrain the economic behaviour of states in a global, non-sovereign environment. He
provides evidence showing that credit ratings are so entrenched in the operation of the
market economy that states can hardly dismiss or limit their use through legislative action
(Lewkowicz 2014, 151). In his view, ratings contribute to reshape the concept of normative
authority at a global scale, i.e. global law, because, in short, they form an effective
normative device through which private financial institutions set standards and audit the
institutional behaviour of states in the global market economy (Lewkowicz 2014, 148, 157).

3. The performative role of indicators: pragmatism and global law

In the field of global law, the performative role of legal indicators means nothing other
than that indicators are devices factually constraining the behaviour of subjects in a nonsovereign
legal context. They bridge the factual, normative and behavioural dimensions
of social normativity (i.e. facts, norms and reasons for action), and therefore enable the
transformation of social facts of legal relevance (e.g. ordered empirical data about the
rule of law) into standards of behaviour (i.e. rule of law benchmarks) that addressees of
legal metrics generally strive to observe. Indeed, legal indicators are not only a set of
socio-legal research methods conducted periodically and systematically with the aim of
describing the evolution of a socio-legal reality over time; they also have a performative
role as standard setting and accountability tools. They appeal to the ‘magic’ of statistics
(Desrosieres 1993, 88) to create new socio-legal realities, and to the managerial toolbox
to ensure reactivity, this is, a change of behaviour in the subjects being evaluated,
observed or measured (Espeland and Sauder 2007, 3).
Legal scholars often overlook the performative role of indicators, in part, because we
are trained to adopt an exclusive standpoint in the study of legal phenomena, more often
particular than global. Additionally, we tend to limit our scope of research to normative
devices which have an a-priori legal nature (i.e. rules broadly speaking), instead of those
which in practice effectively frame legally relevant behaviour of individuals and institutions.
In other words, we tend to neglect normative (Twining 2000, 2010, 224233) and
legal pluralism(s) (Vanderlinden 2013).
To ensure a broader perspective, this special issue relies on the pragmatic approach of
the Brussels School of Jurisprudence (Frydman and Lewkowicz 2015), first revisited by

12 D. Restrepo Amariles

Downloaded by [University of Otago] at 10:08 14 October 2015
Perelman in the field of legal argumentation (with Tyteca 1958), and later renewed by
Frydman in the field of global law (2014, 181200). Frydman’s re-statement of legal
pragmatism, or europragmatism (Haack 2014), in global law studies underlines three cornerstone
ideas in regards to the study of legal indicators.

3.1. Brussels’ pragmatism and global law

First, Frydman argues that the first stage in the study of the consequences of globalisation
on law should be empirical research, mainly through case studies and field observations
(2014, 184185). In his view, researchers should give priority to micro-legal studies of
legal problems and the perspective of the actors involved (i.e. particular perspectives),
before they move to state or analyse general theories about law and globalisation. This
particular perspective is meaningful because it sets forth what individuals experience as
constrains (e.g. obligations) or empowerments (e.g. rights) framing their legally relevant
behaviour. This symposium embraces this particular perspective in the study of legal indicators
and combines it with a global perspective on the evolution of law in the world. This
explains why contributors rely on case studies of legal indicators and indicators-based
programmes to explore how law, as a social institution, evolves in a multifaceted and
multi-scalar context.
Contributors consequently engage with non-state law (e.g. codes of conduct and certification
programmes), explore phenomena like diffusion of law (e.g. arbitration), competition
among regulatory practices (e.g. corporate social responsibility, labelling and
auditing, and state law) and further discuss the relations between legal metrics, policymaking
and development (e.g. ‘justice in numbers’, happiness indicators and the Open
Method of Coordination). At the risk of simplification, some of them attempt to identify,
from a general perspective, certain trajectories, patterns and differences in the transformation
of legal practices at local, regional and global scales.
Second, Frydman (2014, 183184) defines the field of study of legal scholarship by
reference to the effects normative devices produce in reality (Summers 1981, 872). He
does not define it by reference to the belonging of such devices to the formal sources of
law, or to passing what Dworkin called the ‘pedigree test’ (Dworkin 1967, 17). In other
words, his pragmatic approach to global law replaces the ‘pedigree test’ by an ‘effects test’.
From this perspective, Frydman’s conception of global law partly overlaps with
Twining’s ideas about the meaning of global law in the preface of this issue. Both of
them think of global law first and foremost as a field concept. For Frydman, global law is
an overarching concept defining the study of normative devices with global effects; for
Twining, it is better understood, though with some reservations, as a field of study concerned
with law in the world as a whole (Frydman and Twining 2015). Both of these
views give relevance to the study of legal indicators as an object of legal scholarship and
open new horizons to the use of indicators in our efforts to understand and theorise about
law from a global perspective.
Third, Frydman builds from pragmatism and his rejection of methodological nationalism
an elementary, but substantive, conception of global law (2014, 187188). For Frydman,
global law as an analytical concept, using Twining’s terms, results from the need to
address the question of how to regulate practical situations arising from the emerging
global society, in the midst of a multiplicity of legal systems and fragmented legal
regimes. In the preface, he argues that his conception of global law is pluralistic because
it addresses the above question without suggesting the need for unification or convergence,
or in other words, without reproducing, as mindset or methodology, a state-like
world legal system or monist conception of global law. Instead, he conceives global law

The Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law 13

Downloaded by [University of Otago] at 10:08 14 October 2015
as a struggle among actors, strategies and normative devices to set standards of behaviour,
audit compliance and impose sanctions to actors of the emerging global society.
This conception of global law opens the possibility of thinking about the effects of
indicators beyond the sociological idea of reactivity. It suggests that indicators may also
be studied as normative devices in a non-sovereign environment, i.e. from the perspective
of a pluralistic understanding of global law. This does not mean, however, that indicators
are deployed in a territorial vacuum. For Frydman, global law pervades different levels of
legal and political authority, from the most local and territorialised political entities and
communities (e.g. local or national statistics in the administration of justice) to the most
transnational, network-organised forms of social and economic interaction (e.g. international
arbitration or corporate social responsibility).
The question this special issue addresses unfolds in this context. Overall, contributors
to this issue seek to account for how indicators  as an analytical concept  and other
associated normative devices and programmes (e.g. Open Method of Coordination or The
Marine Stewardship Council Programme) affect the conduct of individuals, institutions
and other subjects of law (e.g. judges, states, investors, fishers, transnational corporations,
etc.) at various geographical scales. Whether this constitutes a subject of study of
global law  as a field concept , or a normative device of global law  as an analytical
concept , is in my view a matter of perspective, global or particular respectively. In
both cases, the question of legal pluralisms (Vanderlinden 2013, 4252) is central since
it highlights the performative role indicators play among the multiple normative constraints
coexisting in a multi-scalar society.

4. A global perspective on indicators and global law: the mathematical turn and
the rise of managerial reasoning in law
The case studies contained in this special issue bring to light the hidden life of some indicators,
their epistemological and operational underpinnings, and the mechanisms through
which they become entrenched in institutional practices and other global devices. Some
of these studies also show the type of contestations and resistance indicators experience
in the specific contexts in which they are created and implemented, and at times, how
they are dismissed, abolished or changed. However, this particular, micro-legal approach
does not provide us with a general explanation about how indicators are changing the
way we see and think about law.
One may need to adopt a long-term scale and global perspective of law in the world,
as proposed by Twining (2009a, 520, 2009b, 18), if one wishes to spot and theorise
about the trajectories, patterns and differences in the way indicators are transforming
legal practices and legally relevant behaviour at local, regional and global scales.
A global perspective, according to Twining, allows us to discern ‘some general tendencies
and biases in Western academic legal culture that are in the process of coming
under sustained challenge in the context of “globalisation”’ (Twining 2009a, 5). This
global perspective reveals two key transformations indicators are triggering in the field of
law, both of which I have already discussed elsewhere (Restrepo-Amariles 2014a,
193234). These are (1) a mathematical turn and (2) the rise of managerial forms of legal
reasoning. In the following pages, I lay down the main characteristics of each of them.

4.1. Indicators and the mathematical turn in law

The mathematical turn defines the increasing use of mathematical and statistical techniques
to describe, explain, assess and prescribe human and institutional behaviour of legal

14 D. Restrepo Amariles

Downloaded by [University of Otago] at 10:08 14 October 2015
relevance (Restrepo-Amariles 2014a, 194). It is a multifaceted notion relating as much to
‘talk about law’ as to ‘law talk’ (Twining 2009a, 2425,44), and as such, it embraces a
set of disparate practices existing in the legal domain. In pointing out their shared mathematical
underpinnings, I seek to provide a common framework to discuss their common
assumptions and implications. In practice, the mathematical turn means nothing other
than that mathematical arguments are becoming acceptable explanations of legal phenomena,
both as a developing method of legal analysis, and as an emerging technique of
regulation.
In legal scholarship, the mathematical turn is an analytical trend in construction. It
relies on mathematical and statistical techniques to describe legal phenomena and theorise
about law at new levels of abstraction. As such, it seeks to expand the range of
research methods and techniques used in legal research and legal reasoning, with the aim
of furnishing legal scholars, practitioners and operators with more scientific and more
general insights about law. As a set of research practices, the mathematical turn attempts
to level up legal research methods with the scientific developments of our time, in which
we have not only more empirical data, but also more sophisticated use of it.
The evidence produced in this way aims most often to complement, sometimes challenge,
the linguistic, argumentative, historical and qualitative-sociological accounts of
law which are often deemed subjective and belief based (Aft, Mitchell, and Rust 2012,
16). What the mathematical turn underlines is probably the beginning of the realisation of
Holmes’ prediction in The Path of the Law, when he said that the man of the future in the
study of the law was not the black-letter man, but the man of statistics and the master of
economics (1897, 469).
In legal practice, the mathematical turn appears as a new way of producing legal and
regulatory devices on the basis of mathematical modelling, as well as a tool to advance
rights and fact-based claims in law-making, law administration and adjudication. Examples
range from the use of statistical evidence in the courtroom (Kadane 2008; Dawid,
Twining, and Vasilaki 2011) and probability in risk regulation (Franklin 2005; Gastwirth
2013) to the development of regulation and compliance software (Grimmelmann 2005;
Bamberger 2010) and the production of statistics in the context of new public management
(Ministere de la Justice Francais ¸ 2012; Borges Fortes 2015).
Franklin has shown for instance the predominance mathematical reasoning has gained
in global financial regulation, prompted mainly by the Basel II accords (Franklin 2005,
243245), and continued under Basel III. Basel II allowed banks to evaluate their credit
risk (i.e. defaults of loans) and exchange rate risk (i.e. losses from changes in currency
exchange rates) using their own internal models and statistical technology under the condition
they disclose them to the national regulatory agency and that the latter approves
them. This opened the path for the exchange of statistical arguments before financial regulatory
agencies and the admission of statistical models as evidence of compliance. This
situation is particularly salient in Europe, where Basel II accords were endorsed by EU
legislation (Directive 2006/49/EC).
Legal indicators combine and further develop both dimension of the mathematical
turn. First, they are used to describe the quality and performance of state law (e.g. Rule of
Law Index) and to theorise about the trajectories of legal systems from a global perspective
(e.g. comparisons through numbers, Michaels 2009). Second, they are also used to
design regulatory devices in a global law setting, including performance measures and
ratings (e.g. credit rating agencies). This special issue also provides evidence showing
that indicators are increasingly used in the design, implementation and assessment of
legal and judicial reforms. They are becoming vital for decision-making processes in

The Journal of Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law 15

Downloaded by [University of Otago] at 10:08 14 October 2015
public and private sectors, for the assessments of legal systems, and especially for the
allocation of development aid funds (Arndt 2009). In brief, indicators are increasingly
taken to be explanatory, sometimes even demonstrative, arguments of the way legal systems
or parts thereof work.
Perry-Kessaris is one of the few legal scholars to have rightly spotted the key analytical
significance of this shift towards numbers and discussed its theoretical implications. She
persuasively argues, following Twining’s dimensions of jurisprudence, that indicators transpose
the approach of neoclassical economics at the empirical (quantification), normative
(marketisation) and analytical (mathematisation) level to the field of law and development
(Perry-Kessaris 2011, 406407). In this context, she claims that the mathematics underpinning
indicators is supposed to ‘clarify and render transparent relationships whether
hypothesized or proven  between concepts’ (Perry-Kessaris 2011, 410). Perry-Kessaris
goes on to claim that the economic approach of indicators transforms the empirical and
analytical dimensions of law because it introduces numbers as facts and establishes methods
of correlation for their association.
I am in general accord with Perry-Kessaris’ thoughtful observations, but since my perspective
is broader, I shall provide further clarifications of my point of view. First, from
my perspective, it seems unfair to put the increasing mathematisation of law’s analytical
dimension exclusively to the influence economics is having on law and development. As
I argued elsewhere (Restrepo-Amariles 2014b, 175194), the movement towards mathematisation
and scientific treatment of reality is a persistent and wider phenomenon affecting
the social sciences in general, including economics, which until the early twentieth
century was anything but a mathematical discipline (Roos 1948, 127129).
Second, I agree with Perry-Kessaris that market ideology and linear relationships are
important economic factors behind the mathematisation of law’s analytical dimension.
Yet, in my view, it is mathematical reasoning broadly speaking that underpins the way
most legal indicators attempt to construct legal concepts, relate them to one another and
give them sense in a specific context. From my perspective, mathematical reasoning is in
contrast with the linguistic and conceptual modes of legal reasoning underlying the
black-letter study of law. Today, an increasing number of legal indicators rely on noneconomic
assumptions such as those based on expert opinions and direct quantification,
yet they rely on mathematical analysis and modelling at the stage of data aggregation
(Restrepo-Amariles and McLachlan 2015, 2338).
Finally, I think this issue provides evidence to expand on the link Perry-Kessaris makes
between Twining’s normative, analytical and empirical dimensions of jurisprudence and
the mathematisation promoted by indicators. In my view, by using mathematical reasoning
to define legal concepts and establish relationships between them, legal indicators promote
a new proceduralisation of law and social values in the context of globalisation. This mathematical
proceduralisation increasingly attempts to supersede the argumentative and consensual
model underpinning law, and international law in particular, in the mission of
defining the form and content of legal standards with global reach.
Legal indicators may thus play a greater role in defining concepts such as labour
rights, legal certainty or reasonable delay of judicial proceedings in a transnational perspective.
Think for instance about the concepts of well-being or unemployment as social,
as opposed to individual, phenomena. What are they if not what ‘well-being’ (GDP or
Gross National Happiness) or unemployment indicators respectively measure? As legal
indicators become entrenched into new managerial models of governance of legal systems,
their mathematically constructed meanings and relationships may continue to
spread in the everyday life of law.

4.2. Indicators and managerial forms in legal reasoning

Frydman has noted rightly that indicators and other unconventional transnational norms,
like the standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), are capable of reaching faster and
wider consensus than international law rules due to their apparent technical and voluntary
character (Frydman 2014, 192200). In the context of the ‘audit society’ (Power 1997,
414), we live in and in which these norms unfold, mathematical reasoning has gained
predominance because it is seen as a technical, often depoliticised, means to set standards
of behaviour and assess their compliance, such as argued earlier in regard to global financial
regulation. However, mathematical reasoning itself is only the analytical tool of the
broader managerial mode of governance in which indicators are entrenched and that is
increasingly pervading the legal field, and legal reasoning in particular.
I use the expression ‘legal reasoning’ here with the explicit purpose of calling to attention
the restricted use that has been given to this concept in Anglo-American jurisprudence
to signify what ‘lawyers do when they argue court cases … and what judges do
when they decide cases’ (May and Brown 2010, 7). In this article, the idea of ‘legal reasoning’
refers broadly to what regulators, compliance agents, rule-followers, scholars,
etc. do when they discuss normative claims of human and institutional behaviour. It is
thus not restricted to the context of adjudication but to the lager spectrum of norm-issuance,
following, administration and enforcement.
Legal indicators are transforming legal reasoning and the mindset in which we tend to
think about the life of rules (i.e. law-making, administration and adjudication) by setting
legal concepts within the managerial mindset of performance measures. Two main consequences
follow. First, law is not defined only as a set of rules, but also as a measurable
process capable of improvement and made up of measurable practices. Second, law, as a
process, embraces part of the managerial toolbox in its everyday life, opening new horizons
to think about the creation, implementation and enforcement of norms, and not only
of rules, in the managerial terms of data-gathering, benchmarking and auditing.

4.2.1. Law as process and performance measures

A performance measure is broadly defined as a ‘general term applied to a part of the conduct
of the activities of an organisation over a period of time, often with reference to some
standard or base, with emphasis on management responsibility and accountability, or the
like’ (Edwards 1986, 12). In management practice, a performance measure is successful
if it facilitates the management control process through which managers ensure that the collection,
allocation and use of resources is done in an efficient and effective manner to
accomplish the objectives of the organisation (Edwards 1986, 12). Legal indicators apply
this approach to law and focus, just like any other performance measure does, on measuring
the inputs, processing system, outputs, outcomes or goals of legal processes.
Most legal indicators today focus predominantly on socio-legal outcomes (RestrepoAmariles
and McLachlan 2015, 15). They measure the extent to which the end results of
legal processes (e.g. adjudication) are satisfactory or not to users of legal systems (e.g.
users of the court system or alternative dispute resolution mechanisms). Indicators assess
legal processes in general, and outcomes in particular, through three methodologically
distinct but practically interconnected stages, namely (1) collection of performance information,
(2) benchmarking and (3) auditing, which generally go together with incentives
for the best performers.

As mentioned earlier, indicators are not only a set of research methods aimed at collecting
information about performance of socio-legal concepts and institutions. They are
also a mechanism of standard-setting and identification of good practices (i.e. benchmarking),
especially, when developed across countries and over time. In my view, benchmarking
as a pragmatic, management-based way of developing standards of individual and
institutional behaviour increasingly cooperates and competes  or is in ‘coopetition’ to
use Djelic’s language (2011, 43)  with legal rules in certain fields of legally relevant
behaviour. However, benchmarking significantly differs from the way rules set standards
of behaviour and assesses compliance.
On the one hand, since a benchmark is drawn from comparison, its content is relative
to the entities compared, realistic because is grounded in actual practice and dynamic
because it changes overtime depending on real performance. In contrast to an intrinsic
concept of outcome quality, benchmarking defines the concept of quality in a pragmatic
manner, for instance, by focusing on the satisfaction of users of legal systems. On the
other hand, benchmarking also introduces an alternative way of assessing social facts
against norms, not in the binary terms legal/illegal  as legal reasoning does with rules,
but in terms of degree, i.e. it determines where a given conduct is located in a performance
scale, and how close or far it is from the benchmark. One may think for instance
of an indicator in the field of corporate social responsibility. It will not state whether a
company is in breach or not of a given rule of environmental law, but rather the extent to
which its environmental behaviour fits the industry conception and standards of corporate
social responsibility (e.g. 6 out of 10).
Legal indicators also introduce auditing as a management practice into law. Today,
auditing has become a lifestyle. Individuals, as users or consumers of services and goods,
whether public or private, request and trust audits because they are believed to ensure
transparency, enhance accountability and guarantee safety (Power 1997, 45). In our,
increasingly global ‘audit society’ (Power 1997), the international bureaucracy uses more
and more legal indicators to conduct systematic and periodic audits of states’ legal systems.
Merry clearly describes the audit role of indicators in the field of human rights:

The turn to indicator creation marks a shift in the way the administration of human rights law
takes place. Instead of pressuring countries to conform to human rights laws on the basis of
ambiguous and contextualized accounts in country reports or case studies—reports in which
each country is presented as shaped by its history, social structure, wealth, and political agendas—indicators
provide comparable information in numerical terms. The burden of assessment
rests on the indicator itself, with its agreed-on standards and means of measurement…
The reliance on numbers, with their apparently simple and straightforward meanings, produces
an unambiguous and easily replicated field for judgment. Compliance becomes far more
open to inspection and assessment. (2011, 88)

Moreover, it is telling, to paraphrase Dworkin, that today even the sovereigns of
Law’s Empire, namely parliaments and the administration of justice, are subject to audit
controls. In this special issue, Borges Fortes provides original empirical data and an illuminating
analysis which contributes to a better understanding of the performative role of
indicators (2015). In his analysis of the Brazilian state programme ‘Justice in numbers’,
Borges Fortes shows the links between the rise of legal indicators and a change in the
behaviour of the Brazilian judiciary. Borges Fortes argues that judges and clerks tend to
come in line with the performance standards indicators embody, in part because they are
linked to mechanisms of internal promotion and professional disciplinary control (i.e.
incentives). He points out that indicators are thereby inducing a worrying shift in the

values driving the Brazilian administration of justice. Adjudication is on the way to
becoming less content oriented and quality driven, and more prone to act in fulfilment of
efficiency criteria.

5. Concluding remarks

Nelken has recently pointed out rightly the capacity of indicators to transform facts into
norms when they are used for governance (2015). Indeed, the fact description and performative
roles (i.e. standard setting and auditing) of indicators may be distinguished analytically
for the purpose of academic or methodological discussions. However, in practice,
when indicators are associated to a managerial mode of governance, these two aspects are
inevitably intertwined. In this regard, I have argued throughout this paper that legal indicators
reproduce a performance-based managerial mode of governance in the field of
global law. They seek to frame individual and institutional behaviour by means of three
key managerial mechanisms, namely performance data collection, benchmarking and
auditing. In brief, this article attempted to show how these practices  central to any contemporary
approach to public and private management today, are expanding into the legal
field, transforming en passant, the way we experience, see and think about law in the context
of globalisation.
In my view, legal indicators are called upon to play at least two decisive roles in the
coming years within legal scholarship and practice. First, indicators may help to improve
the cognitive and theoretical dimensions of our legal discipline. If we legal scholars
engage with indicators in the view of both, providing sustained critique and attempting
refinement, they may in turn help to improve our socio-legal research methods and quality
of our empirical data. This shall enhance our capacity to understand and theorise sociolegal
realities at new levels of abstraction. Second, as indicators are expected to continue
gaining relevance among public and private decision-makers, so will happen with their
performative role. Hence, legal scholars may want to keep an eye on how the expanding
managerial model of governance overarching indicators will affect law from a global perspective,
especially in regards to what seems an inevitable shift towards evidence-based
decision-making in the legal domain.
