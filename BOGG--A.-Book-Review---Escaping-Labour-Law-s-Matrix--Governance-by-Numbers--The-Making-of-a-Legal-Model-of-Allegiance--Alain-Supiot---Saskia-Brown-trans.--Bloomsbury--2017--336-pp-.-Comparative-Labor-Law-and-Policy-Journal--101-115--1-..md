BOOK REVIEW

ESCAPING LABOR LAW’S MATRIX

Governance by Numbers: The Making of a Legal Model of Allegiance, Alain
Supiot, (Saskia Brown trans., Bloomsbury, 2017, 336 pp).

reviewed by Alan Bogg†

1999 was an auspicious year. It was the year that I began in earnest as a
student of labor law in the neoliberal twilight years of the twentieth century,
with my discipline in its seeming death throes. It was also the year that the
critically acclaimed science fiction film The Matrix was released. The actor
Keanu Reeves had been required to read Jean Baudrillard’s famous work
Simulacra and Simulation as a philosophical prelude to reading the film
script.1 The Matrix is a meditation on the nature of real human experience.
The film is set in a dystopian future where intelligent machines have
subjugated human beings who are encased in pods to harvest their bioelectric
energies. The matrix is a simulated reality within which the conscious minds
of the enslaved people are imprisoned. It is rather like a scaled-up version of
Robert Nozick’s “experience machine”
2
: a computer-generated mirage that
masks their real situation of enslavement. The heroic quest of this small band
of liberated human beings was to smash through the simulation and to live a
real human life outside of the matrix. Emancipation meant that the human
beings must reclaim the real territory of lived human experience.
Twenty years on, a reading of Professor Alain Supiot’s Governance by
Numbers: The Making of a Legal Model of Allegiance reveals a manifesto of
profound importance.3
It is a stirring call for the emancipation of the human
being, and the repositioning of the human being at the very center of work
and politics. It is underpinned by rigorous scholarship on a grand scale and it

scintillates with brilliant insights. For Supiot, the fate of work and the fate
of politics are intertwined. In the book, Supiot argues that freedom depends
upon human beings reclaiming the territory and repudiating the map.4 What
does this mean? The territory describes the situation where the human
imagination can leave its imprint in the world through meaningful agency in
labor and democratic politics. The map is the matrix-like simulacrum of
numbers, metrics, targets and statistics which provide the structure and
content of new forms of governance in the public and private spheres.
Supiot’s fundamental claim is that human beings are becoming progressively
more alienated from politics and work through the tyranny of numbers. This
treatise stands in a long and distinguished line of works in French social
theory on the interplay between domination and emancipation in modern
society. The work of Michel Foucault is in point here who, like Supiot, was
also a Professor of the prestigious Collège de France.
Governance by Numbers thus provides a grand theory of labor law’s fate
in the early decades of the twenty-first century. This sets it apart from more
particularized engagements with specific sectors of work activity (for
example, care work), the regulatory challenges of gig work, the phenomenon
of precarious work, or the stability and prevalence of the standard
employment relationship. Supiot’s distinctive contribution is to examine the
multiple linkages among conceptualizations of the state, legal form, public
and private governance, and the constitution of work. In this way, he is
concerned to penetrate the deeper causes of work’s degradation in the modern
era. This process is linked umbilically to the degradation of legal form and
of democratic politics. This contamination across different spheres of public
life is being driven by the normativity of numbers and metrics.
The book is divided into two parts. The first part traces the decline of
law as a cultural form that instantiates shared meanings between citizens of
a political community. Its “overthrow” has been facilitated by the rise of a
“cybernetic imaginary” where individuals are expected “to react in real time
to the multiple signals they receive, in order to meet the targets they are
assigned.”
5 This is the world of algorithms, metrics, instant feedback,
indicators, and benchmarking. The second part explores some of the
consequences of “governance by numbers” for the structuring of employment
relations. Supiot suggests that the withering away of legal form and state
sovereignty has led to the emergence of feudal forms of allegiance between
networks of stronger and weaker actors. While many labor lawyers will be
familiar with “fissuring” discourse in the modern economy,6 Supiot’s

intriguing thesis attaches political significance to this phenomenon. Fissuring
is not merely an economic process: it represents a new form of political
organization based upon vassalage. Having identified these complex
dynamics over centuries of legal and political development, and across a
panoramic comparative sweep, Governance by Numbers then explores the
possibilities for a reconstitution of labor law and the politics of work. This is
a remarkable and ambitious work. Before evaluating Supiot’s main claims, it
is important first to clarify the structure of the argument.
The first part of the book traces the deep historical roots of governing
by law and its gradual eclipse by “governance by numbers.” For Supiot, rule
by law represents a particular aesthetic imaginary. The contours of this
imaginary are painted in bold historical strokes, across different cultures, and
through an examination of Greek and Roman legal traditions. There are of
course important cultural variations in this ideal of government by law, and
Supiot is sensitive to these differences. However, this symbolic ideal of law
might today be understood as the “Rule of Law.” It would reject the reductive
thesis that law is simply an instrument, like a sharp knife, designed to achieve
specified ends with ruthless efficiency. Instead, the Rule of Law represents
an ideal of government where citizens are consecrated as citizens with dignity
and autonomy and are governed by shared rules.7 The law addresses them as
agents with dignity, and it does so in the normative terminology of
obligations. The law is not simply coercive brute force like the threats of a
gangster. Legal texts and political institutions provide a cultural structure of
solidarity in the political community. Supiot’s account of legal and historical
development traces the slow degradation of these ideal of “government,” and
its progressive substitution by “governance”:
Where “government” relies on subordinating individuals, “governance,”
in line with its cybernetic vision, relies on programming them. . . . The
subordinated worker obeys the rules he is given, whereas the programmed
worker reacts to the information reaching him from his environment. The
move from subordination to programme is absolutely central to our
contemporary representation of human action.8
Supiot’s careful tracing of this movement is legal scholarship in the
genre of the longue duree, and this makes it a rather unusual work in the labor
law canon. For example, chapter 4 exposes the latency of “social harmony
by numbers” in ancient political and legal practices. It is an excursus that
takes us through Pythagoras, Plato and the Renaissance Neo-Platonists.
Numbers represented secret truths of an imminent rational order in the world.
This inspired the hope that esoteric knowledge of mathematical harmonies

might provide models for the ordering of citizens in political communities.
Given these roots in esoteric mystical practices, we are then led through the
emergence of a normativity of numbers in early forms of legal practice in
chapter 5. This is reflected in the legal obligation of accounting (whereby the
account becomes the authoritative accreditation of a truth through the
medium of a numerical image); the use of statistics and quantification as a
technique of government, identifying regularities and patterns of social
behavior in order to manage populations; the rise of probabilistic reasoning
in adjudication; and the use of quantification as a basis for designing
legislative interventions. In this way, the law’s encounter with quantification
is a longstanding one. While the harnessing of scientific rationality and
mathematical expertise is both inevitable and productive, it is an encounter
that has also been fraught with risk. The Supiot narrative implies that the
imagined superior objectivity of quantification has always threated to
undermine the authority of law as a symbolic medium.
Chapters 6 and 8 provide the most interesting contemporary insights
into Supiot’s thesis of the gradual entrenchment of “government by
numbers.” Chapter 6 explores the “dethronement of law” in two seemingly
different political situations, the Soviet-style “planned economy” and the
Anglo-American neoliberal paradigm. The modern era represents a
“hybridisation” of these models which have conspired to displace law in
favor of quantification. In the planned economy, law is reduced to an
instrument or tool to implement the detailed numerical planning determined
by the central planning committee. According to Supiot, this was a form of
“government by numbers.”
9
It was not yet a form of governance because the
individual was still subjected to coercive control implemented through legal
directives. In neoliberal thinking, the law is also a mere technical tool that
provides a minimal framework within which contracting parties maximize
their self-interest through bargaining.
In both ideal-types, the conceptualization of law as a coercive
instrument “most certainly represents a regression and shows a lack of
understanding of the law as a nodal point in the domestication of power. Law
is most certainly a technique of power, but it is a technique which binds and
limits power.”
10 This “dethronement of law” leads to its degradation as
cultural form. Laws become a product to be bought and sold in the political
marketplace to the highest bidder; they also become simply another resource
to be allocated in a contract, perhaps through the designation of a private

arbitrator to “resolve disputes” or choice of law clauses in a global
marketplace of legal systems. Ultimately, calculation becomes the norm,
akin to a biological norm or a computer programme, it results from the
interaction of individual calculations and it operates from within. The
interiorisation, or eradication of heteronomy, is precisely what
governance means: whereas government implies a commanding position
above those governed . . . governance starts out from individual freedoms,
not to limit but rather to programme them.11
The fact that there has been a confluence between capitalism and
communism appears to give this process an irresistible momentum. Chapter
8 provides a powerful overview of the displacement of law by “governance
by numbers” at multiple levels of normative activity. In each normative
domain, there is a “system of self-adjusting interacting units automatically
responding to signal inputs and feedback, as programmed by computer
algorithms.”
12 Parallel regulatory phenomena are identified at the levels of
individual governance, corporate governance, public sector governance,
European governance, and global governance. Quantification,
benchmarking, and indicators pervade each of these levels of governance.
This has corroded democratic principles across multiple regulatory levels.
The second part examines the specific consequences of “governance by
numbers” in the field of social law and the organization of work. This is more
familiar intellectual territory for labor lawyers, though Supiot analyses that
territory in new and interesting ways. In chapter 9, Supiot examines the
phenomenon of “governance by numbers” and the friction that it generates at
the interface with “government by laws.” In the employment context, the
book offers important insights into the reconfiguration of Taylorism by
modes of quantification. Under Taylorism, workers “were reduced to the
status of cogs obeying mechanically the rules of the workshop and the
rhythms of the machines.”
13 Despite the promise of liberation through
technological advancement, “governance by numbers” “ensnares managers
and workers alike in feedback loops governed by numerical representations
of the world increasingly disconnected from experience.”
14 Or again,
“Taylorism was based on the total subordination of workers to a rationalised
system imposed from outside, whereas today the organization of work is
predicated on programming.”
15
Supiot then traces the complex dynamics within protective labor law
generated by this new figure of the “programmed worker.” For example,

there is an interesting discussion of sites of resistance from French health and
safety law to the mental degradations wrought by dehumanized work.16
These legal challenges to objectives-led management techniques provide
opportunities for democratic empowerment, and Supiot accordingly rejects
crude technological determinism. This chapter also gestures tantalizingly to
another possibility, which is that labor law developments can also be a Trojan
Horse for the deeper penetration of “governance by numbers” into working
life. Nearly twenty years ago, in the heyday of “third way” labor law in the
United Kingdom, proposals emerged for new contractual paradigms based
upon high-discretion contractual performance.17 On the face of it, this shift
might be interpreted as an emancipatory development marking a transition
from coercive subordination to cooperation and autonomy. Supiot’s powerful
arguments provide a stark reminder that legal developments must always be
assessed within the broader social, economic, and technological context. Just
as formal subordination is eclipsed, new and more insidious forms of
structural domination emerge. Autonomy must be assessed in its totality.
Good faith and ideals of contractual cooperation may facilitate a state of selfenslavement
through the internalization of metrics. Self-enslavement is a
pernicious form of domination precisely because its chains are not so
tangible.
Chapters 10 and 11 set out the core analytical theses of the second part
of the book. Chapter 10 explores the contours of the “withering away of the
state.” For Supiot, this is reflected most strongly in the erosion of the public
sphere and of the sovereignty of state law. State law and the sovereignty of
the state has been displaced by the narrowing of mandatory ius cogens norms
in favor of ius dispositivum norms that can be modified or excluded through
private ordering. It is also reflected in the expanding legal universe of
proliferating norm-systems that can be opted into through employment
contracts. Legal norms are becoming an object of consumer choice like shoes
or sofas. Imagine being a platform driver in Barcelona, contracting with a
platform provider in New York, with your employment disputes governed by
employment laws in Amsterdam. In the most extreme versions of this
phenomenon, employment contracts provide for compulsory and
individualized private arbitration so that employment disputes are channeled
out of the system of public courts entirely.18 In the United States, the public

courts have themselves been complicit in this privatization of public justice.19
According to Supiot, “such legal forum shopping is of course incompatible
with a system based on the rule of law, but it has its place in one based on
rule by laws.”
20 This is no doubt facilitated by the emergence of leximetrics,
using numerical values and coding techniques to rank legal systems by
business-friendly indicators, under the guidance of the World Bank.21
According to Supiot, the vacuum created by the “withering of the state”
and the “dethronement of law” explains the emergence of a new feudalism
based upon “ties of allegiance.” This represents a situation where “the key
idea is not that all should be subject to the same abstract law, but that each
person should behave according to his or her place in the network. Each must
serve the interests of those on whom he depends, and be able to count on the
loyalty of those who depend on him.”
22 On an initial encounter, these ideas
of serfdom, loyalty, and vassalage seemed rather odd and obscure within the
context of the current predicaments of labor law.23 I now incline to the view
that there is considerable analytical power in this way of framing things. In
particular, we start to see familiar phenomena from different angles. In a
brilliant analysis of the “de-constitutionalisation” of collective labor rights in
Greece, Ioannis Katsaroumpas has critiqued the dismantling of Greek social
law through the use of economic conditionality tools by the Troika.24 While
this narrative has been rather shocking to labor lawyers, witnessing
constitutional norms dissolve like mist in an encounter with commercial debt
arrangements, Supiot’s thesis of a new feudalism enables us to see how this
might be a predictable and normal occurrence at the current political juncture.
It also provides a new perspective on the ubiquitous discourse of “the
fissured workplace.”
25 In fissuring, there is a proliferating network of
contracts parceling out productive activities to different contracting parties.
So far, this has been conceptualized as an economic process that creates
regulatory challenges for enforcement, namely, how to affix liability for
employment standards to the “lead companies” in supply chains. Supiot’s
feudalism thesis exposes fissuring as a political process that is subverting the
sovereignty of law. This is a valuable corrective to underestimating the

significance of fissuring, and its connections to a wider crisis of democratic
governance. It also implies that the regulatory responses to fissuring must be
more than technical fixes to existing enforcement paradigms, such as the
introduction of “joint employer” or “joint and several liability” into the
regulatory armory.
The book concludes with “ways forward.” This depends upon a
reconstitution of labor law that recognizes “the anthropological dimension of
work, understood in its broadest and most concrete sense of human beings’
need to inscribe into their everyday living environment the mental images
which guide their action and collaboration.”26 Above all, this book is an elegy
for the tragic loss of meaning in work and in law.27 In turn, the
“anthropological dimension of work” depends upon the reconstitution of
meaningful work. This invites a search for new forms of solidarity and the
creation of new functions for the nation state in fostering solidarities: “the
state’s role should be to guarantee the articulation between national solidarity
and solidarity organizations within civil society and internationally, which
are woven through these networks of allegiance.”
28 This envisages a radical
democratization of the political and economic spheres so that human agency
can overcome the tyranny of numbers. This is the way out of the matrix.
This is a book of significance and magnitude. Its intellectual power lies
in its ability to jolt and disrupt the familiar ways of framing legal
developments. Here are two examples, both of which originate in the domain
of “protective” labor law. As labor lawyers, we have been accustomed to
defending the citadel of social law from encroachment by the neoliberal
barbarians at the gate. “Governance by numbers” demonstrates how the
deepening of quantified domination is being secreted into ostensibly
protective measures.
The first example is in the context of working time regulation under the
Working Time Directive. In Federación de Servicios de Comisiones Obreras
(CCOO) v. Deutsche Bank SAE the question arose as to whether it was
mandatory for an employer to maintain records of the actual duration of daily
and weekly time worked by workers in order to facilitate the effective
enforcement of working time rights.29 The case arose out of a legal claim
brought by a Spanish trade union. Advocate General Pitruzzella’s Opinion
was that monitoring and precise measurement of working time was a

Supiot’s book reminded me very much of CARL JUNG, MODERN MAN IN SEARCH OF A SOUL (W. S. Dell

mandatory obligation, which flowed from the need to ensure effective
enforcement of working time limits. My first reaction to this case was that it
represented a solidification of worker protective principles in the scheme of
working time principles. Supiot’s arguments might lead us towards a more
cautious assessment. The intensification of monitoring, particularly though
technologies and discrete forms of surveillance, may have dehumanizing
effects on workers. Would protective labor laws legitimate the use of
patented wristbands to track the physical movements of workers?30 Should
this be calibrated to measure the intensity of activities so that working time
limits might be fine-tuned even further? What about technology that
pinpoints cognitive activities such as thinking time? It is often forgotten that
the Working Time Directive is based upon a normative principle of the
humanization of work.31 It is vital that this shadow-side of worker-protective
labor laws is given fuller recognition, and Supiot’s thesis provides a novel
conceptual grammar for doing this.
The second example is drawn from some recent developments in U.K.
labor law. In July 2017 “Good Work: The Taylor Review of Modern
Working Practices” was published.32 This report had been commissioned by
the Government to examine working practices in the U.K. labor market,
prompted by public concerns about exploitation, under-enforcement of
labour standards, and the proliferation of classificatory problems of ‘false
self-employment’ in the ‘gig economy’. It was a remarkable opportunity for
a meaningful public conversation about the constitution of work. Alas, the
Taylor Review did not have a Supiot.
There have been critical engagements with some of the details of the
review’s regulatory proposals.33 However, Supiot’s arguments point the way
to a deeper critique of the review’s intellectual and political framework. First,
there is a startling faith in technology to deliver “clarity” on the issue of
employment status, with the review recommending the development of
“online tools” to assist individuals in discovering the legal identity of the
working arrangements.34 This presents the employment status
characterization as a technical exercise. Where next from here? We might

develop numerical values to attach to specific features of the work
arrangements, and an overall score for the employment status threshold. This,
of course, is precisely the lie of “governance by numbers.” Its effect is to
depoliticize the question of the employment status enquiry, which must be
understood as a creative political act in determining which of us has
employment rights (and which of us does not). Dressing this up as a technical
enquiry, to be assisted by new technology, obscures the politics of
employment status.
Secondly, the review proposes a new statutory definition for an
intermediate category of employment status based upon “control.”
35 Building
upon Supiot’s important distinction between the “subordinated worker” and
the “programmed worker,” to inscribe “control” into a new statutory
definition would be to track a set of preoccupations with the “subordinated
worker.” As the numbers of “programmed workers” expand in the economy,
legal tests need to be supple enough to track those constitutive features of
“programmed work.” The forms and techniques of domination are less overt
for the “programmed worker” than for the “subordinated worker,” precisely
because they are internalized forms of cognitive subjugation. A statutory test
of control, focused on external indicia, risks deflecting the enquiry away from
these elements in new forms of work arrangement.
Thirdly, the review embodies a particular aesthetic style of discourse.
For a review concerned with the future of work and its regulation, it is rather
short in running to 115 pages. It contains lots of quantitative data in chapter
4, setting out the current composition of the U.K. labor market in a variety of
colorful graphs and charts. The text is interspersed with trendy line drawings
of people in a variety of work poses. Yet these people are faceless. Supiot’s
arguments have finally helped me to pin down what I have found so irritating
about this report. The faceless figures signify a glossy and superficial piece
of work that is devoid of cultural and intellectual substance at the symbolic
level. The report ignores a rich corpus of case law stretching back over more
than a century, where courts have grappled with and refined different
approaches to employment status. Undoubtedly, this case law has formulated
legal tests with manifold limitations at the technical level. It has displayed
folly more than wisdom. Yet this body of jurisprudence is a rich repository
of cultural meanings that provide the foundations of a common life and for a
law that we have in common. Supiot’s thesis provides a powerful argument
to the effect that the reconstitution of meaning in work is bound up with the
reconstitution of meaning in our shared legal practices. This suggests that a
reductive approach to legal reform, based upon a slim statutory definition that

takes its year of enactment as Year Zero, is unlikely to be the best way
forward.36
Finally, the Government’s main response to date to the Taylor Review
has been the implementation of a “Good Work Plan.”
37 One plank in this
strategy is dedicated to the promotion of “quality of work.”
38 On its face, this
might seem to invoke Supiot’s “anthropological dimension of work.”
However, the proposal is for the “Industrial Strategy Council” to develop and
refine “effective evaluation metrics” to measure the progress of quality
work.39 Supiot’s thesis identifies the ways in which “evaluation metrics” are
utterly destructive of the “quality of work.” For this reason, the Good Work
Plan’s formula for achieving “quality work” will in fact be its undoing. What
is needed is an approach focused on solidaristic democratic empowerment of
workers, through representative organizations, so that these metrics are
contested, shaped, and implemented through democratic engagement.
Unfortunately, the entire corpus of restrictive trade union laws was outside
the Taylor Review’s terms of reference, so there were very few concrete legal
proposals on collective worker voice.
In sum, Supiot’s work has provided us with a highly original and
analytically powerful framework for theorizing labor law in the twenty-first
century. Inevitably, for a major work in the longue duree genre, there are
some important points of disagreement. For this reader, two of them are
fundamental. First, Supiot is forthright in criticizing the EU institutions, and
particularly the Court of Justice, for its “neoliberal deconstruction of labour
law.”
40 As evidence of this turn, which has “proved irreversible,” he cites the
Viking and Laval cases41 and the Association de médiation sociale case.42
The facts in Viking and Laval hardly need repetition in a labor law journal.
In Association de médiation sociale, the Court concluded that Article 27 of
the EU Charter, conferring a right to information and consultation, did not
have horizontal effect. These cases are described by Supiot as exemplars of

“the Law and Economics doctrine, according to which every legal rule must
be judged in terms of its economic effects.”
43
In contrast to Supiot, I think this economistic reading is too reductive.
These decisions are—rightly—unsettling to many labor lawyers. In
substance, Viking and Laval involved the sacrifice of fundamental social
rights where they conflicted with the employer’s free movement rights under
EU law. Yet it is possible to read Viking and Laval as also involving a
difficult constitutional navigation of competing solidarities in an enlarging
European Union. It is as much a conflict between the competing social and
economic interests of workers from different member states as it is a conflict
between the “social” and the “economic” or between capital and labor.44
Furthermore, the Association de meditation sociale case was a disappointing
failure in the use of the Charter by atypical workers seeking to maintain
solidarity and enforce their collective rights. Yet there is now a litany of
working time cases where Article 31 of the EU Charter has had powerful
normative effects on the interpretation of the Working Time Directive.45
There have also been important worker-protective developments under
Article 47 of the EU Charter, and the effective enforcement of EU social
law.
46
Admittedly, the Court’s encounter with collective forms of solidaristic
empowerment has been more fraught. Still, the longue duree perspective
obscures the complex strands that make up our contemporary legal and
political practices. European labor and social law represent a contested
normative site. Any attempt to impose a Procrustean uniformity on this field
is highly problematic, and certainly so when it is filtered through selected
landmark judgments like Viking and Laval. Like other forms of law, the
cultural symbolism of European social law is rich and multi-layered. Perhaps
U.K. labor lawyers are more sensitive to the worker-protective elements in
that unfolding narrative, given our brutal experience of many decades of
neoliberal deregulation. And there is a strong hermeneutic tradition in AngloAmerican
jurisprudence that treats law as an argumentative practice, with

legal interpretation as constructive interpretation, interpreting the material in
its morally best light.47 At the current time, constructive interpretation of EU
social law strikes me as a moral imperative. In an era of resurgent
nationalism, it would be a profound mistake to give up on the very idea of
European social law in totality.
The second fundamental disagreement is on the “withering of the state”
and the “dethronement of law.” Supiot presents these developments as very
highly developed at the current time. His presentation of these processes is
too categorical. Take the “withering of the state.” This fails to account for the
resurgence of authoritarian populism and resurgent nationalism that has led
to a dramatic reassertion of the coercive power of the nation-state. We can
see these developments in Hungary, Poland, Italy, and the “Brexit” debacle
in the United Kingdom. This re-forging of nationalistic community is often
implemented through coercive primary legislation. In the United Kingdom,
for example, the Immigration Act 2016 and the Trade Union Act 2016 both
represent legal interventions constructed around the cultural symbolism of
organic national unity.48 It could be read as the legislative assertion of a
Schmittian politics of “friend” and “enemy,” with the “enemy” in the guise
of the “illegal migrant” or the disruptive “cultural Marxist” trade unionist.49
This development represents not the “withering” of the nationalistic state, but
its recrudescence. The rise of nationalistic communitarianism, centered on
the nation state, is the reaction against rampant marketization. An urgent task
for our time is to salvage the social and inclusive nation-state, based upon
decent migration regimes and respect for fundamental rights. At the very
least, then, the “withering” thesis should be understood as a single strand in
a rather complex set of vectors shaping the development of the modern state.
I would regard the resurgence of the populist nation-state as one of the most
important developments of our time, and it is difficult to locate it within
Supiot’s intellectual mapping. It also means that it is particularly important
to be precise in portraying the contours of Social Europe at a time when the
EU might have a vital role to play in stabilizing decent work and decent
politics across Europe.
Now take the “dethronement of law.” This obscures the persistence and
value of the general law to provide solutions to some of the problems being
thrown up by the degradation of work. For example, a recent case in Ontario
was concerned with the enforceability of a private arbitration clause that

claims based upon the “withering of the state” rather than its authoritarian resurgence.

compelled the individual to arbitrate in the Netherlands under Dutch law.50
The arbitration clause was treated as invalid by the appeal court, in part
because of the doctrine of unconscionability. This is an important
development in resisting the encroachment of “governance by numbers” and
law as marketized product. In the United Kingdom, the UKSC recently used
the common law fundamental right of access to a court to strike down the
tribunal fees regime that had effectively priced out the most vulnerable
workers from enforcing their basic employment rights in a public court.51
This was based upon a constitutional principle of the Rule of Law, which was
formulated as a public good in the political community. These decisions are
only possible because the law has not been “dethroned,” even though it may
be experiencing tectonic pressures in a globalized world. National legal
systems continue to provide workers with a law in common, some of it of
ancient lineage and carrying deep symbolic meaning, and we do the law (and
the workers) a disservice if we exaggerate its demise.
In sum, Supiot’s work on “governance by numbers” should be read as
the beginning of a research project, rather than its culmination. It reminds me
of the literature around the “standard employment relationship.” Scholarship
had been rather quick to declare the death, extinction, disappearance, or
otherwise mortal condition of the standard employment relationship. More
recent work has taken a more measured view of its position in labor
markets.52 In a similar vein, we now need to examine some of the core claims
of “governance by numbers” in the real world of work and social law. It is
likely that the “withering of the state,” or the “dethronement of law,” or the
rise of algorithmic control, represent important strands in a wider, complex
and dynamic picture.
In 1907, Mahler apparently said to Sibelius that “the symphony is like
the world, it must encompass everything.”
53 Supiot’s work is labor law on a
Mahlerian scale. There are few labor law treatises that lead one through
(amongst many others) Gödel, Livy, Cicero, Schmitt, Simone de Beauvoir
and St. Paul. This is a book that demands much of its reader, but the rewards
are rich indeed.
