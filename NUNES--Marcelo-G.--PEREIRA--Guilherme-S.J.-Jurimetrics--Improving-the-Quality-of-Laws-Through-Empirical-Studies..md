DIAGNOSIS AND SOLUTION

The act of legislating involves a large expenditure of economic and human resources
by legislative houses, the academic community and civil society. Once enacted, the

new law still requires an additional effort from the Judiciary and law enforcers, in
its interpretation and application. In order not to be wasted, these efforts must be
based on investigations of the concrete and current legal reality, in order to guarantee

that new legal regimes meet the desires of the population and the real conflicts
that are daily referred to our courts.

Using jurimetrics can improve the quality of laws

No matter how careful one is when drafting a law, it will always contain a space of
freedom that must be filled in at the time of its fulfillment. Empirical studies of
law, therefore, assume a role of great relevance, as they allow us to know how

citizens and judges behave in the face of an existing law and how they are likely to
behave in the face of a new law. This type of investigation is an important tool that
allows calculating how a law is likely to be received and whether it will be complied with

— or not — by society.

One of the economic and quick means to investigate this reality is jurimetry, a discipline

that studies the functioning of the legal order through statistics, describing the
characteristics of the law in operation and inferring associations capable of
explaining the behavior and reactions of this order. Making use of sampling

and inferential studies, this technique is capable of investigating large populations and
identifying association and causality relationships that elucidate the reasons for the
successes and failures of our current practices. The concrete plane of law
needs to be studied because court decisions, contracts and all acts created daily by

the thousands in the Brazilian legal order are not a mechanical consequence of the
law, but constitute the result of a complex and rich process of coordination of factors legal, social, economic and

Brazil is going through a moment of profound economic and social transformation, a fact

recognizable through the numerous bills and codifying reforms pending in the National Congress.

At this historical moment, it is essential that we pay attention to the importance of empirical

studies. Legislating without statistical data is legislating in the dark.

There is yet another aspect that demonstrates the importance of empirical studies in legislation.

They are also important so that we know where there is hyper-regulation and

where there is hypo-regulation, that is, in which fields there is already excessive regulatory

intervention by the State and where, on the other hand, there is a lack of such intervention.

Such studies make it possible to know where legislative reform is and where it is not, as well

as, having concluded that there is a need for reform, what and how it should be changed.

Abstract academic studies are necessary, but equally essential is the study of reality and

reasoning with a logic focused on practice. All this will help us to outline legislative policies with a

greater probability of success.

Jurimetric surveys are a privileged access channel to the concrete level of law, capable of describing

these large populations of conflicts (the Brazilian Judiciary Power faced an unbelievable mass

of 90 million cases in 2011), informing legislators and jurists about the shortcomings of the

legal regimes currently in force and, thus, provide a clearer image of the improvements they entail.

The dissemination of jurimetric research will help the legal community both in the

preparation of diagnoses and in the development of solutions. Jurimetrics is able to provide

support in legislative debates and, mainly, to (i) identify the foci of hyper- and hypo-regulation;

(ii) overcome idiosyncratic legislative debates, based exclusively on personal experiences and

theoretical concepts of law operators; (iii) diagnose with greater precision the problems that justify

the movement of the legislative machine; (iv) to anticipate with reasonable precision the

effects of new legal regimes; and (v) evaluate the results of transitions between regimes, as

well as the fulfillment of goals pre-established by the Legislature. As a result, we will

have a legal order that is more in line with reality, more functional, more effective, faster, more

economical and, therefore, fairer.

No doctor or laboratory puts a drug on the market without first submitting

its active ingredient undergoes rigorous control tests. In the same way, the "social medicines",

which are the laws, also need to be submitted to tests capable of anticipating their adequacy to

overcome the disturbances that they propose to correct.

psychological tests, which contain abundant information about the challenges to be faced

by legislators.
