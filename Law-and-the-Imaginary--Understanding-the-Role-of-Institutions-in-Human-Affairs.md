"I was stiff and cold, I was a bridge, I lay over a ravine. My toes on one side, my fingers
clutching the other, I had clamped myself fast into the crumbling clay." Franz Kafka, "The
Bridge", 1922 tr. Edwin and Willa Muir It's a remarkable short story by Franz Kafka called "The
Bridge". A traveller approaches a bridge high up in the mountains. It's the bridge which tells the
story. It says how at one end it is anchored firmly in the rock and its feet are anchored firmly at
the other end, Under it, the void. Far below, one can hear a roaring river and rapids. And the
bridge summons all the strength it has to bear the traveller as he crosses, but it cannot resist
the temptation - because this is the first time someone has crossed - of turning round. And so
the bridge drags the traveller down into the abyss. This image expresses particularly well the
role and the place of institutions in human affairs. People are faced with this issue of the void of
meaning. We all need to give our lives meaning, but none can be found scientifically. Institutions
are there to provide us with shared meaning which everyone must accept, but which allows
everyone to live, as far as possible, without violence. Chapter 1 - FROM GOVERNMENT TO
GOVERNANCE Law and the Imaginary Law is something at once familiar and mysterious. Its
importance is often underestimated, yet it plays, today, an absolutely pivotal role. What we are
experiencing today is a major crisis of law. Now what does that mean? To understand the
function of law, we must first understand the anthropology of this strange animal called the
human being. Human beings, like all animals, inhabit the world through their immediate,
biological experience, they exist in the here and now of their instinctual life. But through the
power of speech, the greater use of their brain, and through the whole evolutionary process so
well described by the anthropologist Leroi-Gourhan in his magnificent work, "Gesture and
Speech", human beings at a certain point in their evolution become able to represent
themselves and live in a universe which is not only the here and now of instinctual life: you are
in a meeting, a room, but you can be elsewhere in thought, in the distant past or in different
places. Every child makes the intoxicating discovery of this ability to invent a world which is not
there but into which he can project himself. This is what is meant by the imaginary, the fact that
we live both an instinctual life, and also a life of images. The human being is therefore faced
with a difficulty unknown to animals, the difficulty of harmonising the two, so that our mental
images remain connected to the realities of the world. For example, it is imaginary in this sense
to say that all men and women are free and equal, it contradicts what we can observe, the
factual truth. We see inequalities, and today they are enormous or the equality between men
and women, which is declared in our laws, but does not truly exist in reality. Hence law is the
site of a tension between a certain representation of the world, which must be realisable, and
the actual facts on the ground. It straddles both realms, and resembles both art and science. In
any given period, a single imaginary will subtend a particular civilisation. From the Industrial to
the Cybernetic Imaginary The dominant imaginary at the beginning of the industrial era - the
industrial era falls into several periods, it began in the 19th century, then the second industrial
revolution, associated with the use of electricity, and lastly the First World War and between the
two Wars, when Taylorism became the general method of organising work. During this period,
the dominant imaginary was classical physics. The world was represented as a vast system of
clockwork. God was the Great Clockmaker, the world was a play of forces, and everything was
a question of energies, laws and forces, including the human being in the workplace, who was
thought of in the same terms. Artists portray this, great figures like Fritz Lang with "Metropolis"
or Charlie Chaplin with "Modern Times". They show the imaginary reduction of the human being
to a mere cog, or a productive herd obeying orders mechanically. This representation of the
world began to change during the Second World War and immediately afterwards, with the
invention of the first 'intelligent machines', or computers. They are machines capable of reacting
to the signals received from their external environment. So we have a machine capable of
regulating itself: it is fitted with a programme so that it adjusts to variations in its environment.
This is technically what is called 'regulation', a term drawn from the vocabulary of engineers. For
example, a coal-fired boiler which adjusts its temperature according to the temperature of the
air, or a boat on automatic pilot, where the boat will follow the direction set, without human
intervention. This change also affected the way human work was conceived in the same period.
The Taylorist vision was replaced by what Peter Drucker called management by objectives, that
is, we should not prevent people thinking and have them obey like brainless slaves, rather, we
should develop their mental powers so that they can be programmed to achieve the objectives
of the organisation. Henceforth, this is how human beings should be made to work. And so that
they can monitor their own activity, - Drucker advocates "self-monitoring" - the objectives which
they fix must be quantified so that their performance can be measured. This notion,
"performance", has swamped our vocabulary ever since. So there is the idea of objectives,
actions, and feedback, so that one can adjust one's performance. This change also affects how
one thinks about institutions today. They are likewise conceived in terms of objectives and
programmes. What interested me was to show how the conception of governing individuals
shifted from an idea of order and mechanical obedience to an idea dominated by a cybernetic
imaginary. Cybernetics is these theories which said that one could consider all machines,
humans and animals to be communication machines, and generalises the idea of the computer
across the whole universe. This cybernetic imaginary produces a radical transformation in our
ways of governing, and thinking about institutions. The Origins of our Institutional Crisis Today,
one talks a lot about the economy, but the root of our crises is institutional. We are living
through a far-reaching crisis of institutions. What is an "institution"? What is "instituting"? A
primary school teacher - an "instituteur" in French - institutes children, that is, teaches them to
act on their own, like an adult. It is different from a tutor, who just gives tuition. So instituting is
learning to be free, through learning common rules. Clearly, in this sense, instituting children is
not only a matter for schools, but also concerns other institutions, such as the family, the State,
the nation, and the business world. These are all places involved in instituting the subject, that
is, where subjects learn the frameworks within which they can exercise their freedom.
Historically, in many societies, instituting was achieved through heteronomy, that is, when a
person imposes a common orientation, and people simply obey. This is true of a monarchy, in a
patriarchal family, and in an old-style Taylorist firm, where a heteronomous authoritiy fixes a
course which must be respected by all. Democracy is an ideal in which this common meaning
respected by all, is also developed by all. Everyone contributes to constructing the frameworks
which will be valid for everyone. This is what is called the sovereignty of the law. But this
supposes that everyone has the capacity to consider the common good and not only their
private interests. Montesquieu said - but he was not the first -, when examining the different
political systems that democracy presupposes the citizen's virtue, that is, the ability to set aside
one's petty private interests in order to deliberate collectively on the common good. Today, the
dogma of globalisation and ultra-liberalism is that all rules must be organised around private
interests alone. What drives organisations is private interests alone, and if everyone calculates
his or her private interests, adjusting to others through contracts, we could achieve a world
where justice reigns. Then we could dispense with trying to define a public interest that is
binding on everyone. This is what has caused our serious institutional crisis because no human
community can cohere around juxtaposed private interests. Running Society on Automatic Pilot
Changes in vocabulary are often revealing, and over the last 30 years the words used to qualify
the rules which govern us have undergone important changes. We no longer talk of
government, but of governance; no longer of rules, but of regulation; no longer of morals, but of
ethics. What is at stake in this shift in vocabulary? When we talk of government, rules, and
morals, we are talking about rules imposed from the outside. Governance, regulation and ethics,
however, refer to rules observed spontaneously, as though people had internalised them. So
this change in vocabulary tends to close the gap between the rule and the subject it applies to.
Individuals should behave - hence the idea of behaviourism - human beings could be
programmed, and by examining their behaviour and using the right methods one can control
their behaviour - people have done research on this, things like neuroeconomics, where one
imagines piloting people's behaviour just like one programmes a computer. So the imaginary
here is the idea that subjects, once programmed, will adjust spontaneously to each other.
People think that one can simply programme men and women, and run society on automatic
pilot. Chapter 2 - THE DREAM OF HARMONY BY NUMBERS The Belief in a World Ruled by
Numbers We can identify certain moments in the history of the West - but it would be useful to
compare with China, where the relation to numbers was also very important - we can identify
moments in this history when mathematical representations and figures were regarded as the
ultimate key to social harmony. This was Pythagoras's dream. Pythagoras, the great
mathematician, also inspired a slightly mystical group, which thought everything was ruled by
numbers. We see signs in Ancient Greece of this desire for rule through calculation and
geometry. One aspect of this belief was the discovery of links between geometrical proportions
and musical harmony. Harmony is a question of making different sounds resonate together, it is
the concord of what should be discordant. This idea of harmony was common to music, art,
science, and law. Harmony was thus linked to these spheres of the imaginary. It is clear from
this how mathematical representation, music and human institutions could all be thought of
together. We should not forget that numbers, like letters, are symbols, but they have a different
power because they are not polysemic like words. Every word can be interpreted, whereas in
principle a number is a symbol which can be shared beyond languages. Today, when we go to
other countries, even if we do not understand the language, we can read the numbers. It is a
sort of universal language. The Invention of Bookkeeping Quantified representations of an
ensemble that we can believe in appeared before official statistics, with the invention of
bookkeeping techniques by Italian traders in the late Middle Ages. The first bookkeeping treatise
we have is the work of a Franciscan monk, who is known for importing algebra into Europe.
What is striking is that this appeared at about the same time as the invention of the modern
painting in art. I decide that "what I want in this picture is the representation of an ensemble",
and then "in this chart or quantified table" - with the invention of double-entry bookkeeping - "I
want what is called in English law a 'fair view' of a firm's financial situation". A faithful image, a
true likeness, which shows me the truth of what this image portrays. This technique was
invented as a way of making merchants accountable. This has been admirably explained in a
study by Samuel Jubé, who shows that initially bookkeeping was about responsibility. The idea
was to account for oneself, to make visible one's financial situation for all the other merchants,
so that the market could function correctly. In this respect, recent developments in accounting
are a clear sign of today's disorders because bookkeeping, from the beginning, was obliged to
respect the principle of prudence: you can enter a figure in the books, but you must be careful
about the trust you place in this number. So if I buy something I enter it at its purchase value,
and I subtract its depreciation, but I don't speculate on its market value until I have sold it. This
rule, of prudence, was abandoned at the end of the 20th century and replaced by "fair value",
that is, the immediate market value. This had catastrophic effects during the 2008 financial
crisis. Now we see an inversion and an abandonment of the principle of prudence. The Allegory
of Prudence In Nantes Cathedral, the tomb of Francis II of Brittany is surrounded by four
statues, of the four cardinal virtues: fortitude, temperance, justice and prudence. Prudence is
represented as a young woman holding an object in her left hand. I overheard some schoolchildren
saying that it is an iPad, but the statue is from the Renaissance. In fact, it is a mirror.
She is facing outwards, in one hand she has measuring instruments, and in the other, the
mirror. On the back of the young girl's head is the face of an old man. What this iconography
tells us is that Prudence must use measurement, calculation and quantification to plan an
action, but she must also take the past, and experience, into account. So it is a complex
message. If you keep only the measuring instruments, you are abandoning prudence. Today,
bookkeeping has stopped being prudent. The Development of Statistics On this invention of
statistics, this dynamic of quantification, we have the good fortune to have many excellent works
by Lorraine Daston in the United States or the late Alain des Rosières in France, who wrote
"The Politics of Big Numbers", in which he reexamines the history of the invention of statistics,
with all the problems it posed initially. One of these, in which law is directly involved, was
deciding whether to make the smallpox vaccine obligatory, although it was known that a certain
number of the children vaccinated would die from the vaccination. The question was the
justification of laws based on quantified social data. This only really developed in the 19th
century, and the Social State was the direct product of this. People discovered in the 19th
century that society could be regarded as an object placed in front of one - which was not the
case previously, and the word "society" only gained its modern sense in this period - and as a
quantifiable object. And people tried, through quantification, to explore the attributes and the
laws of how society functions. And once these laws of society had been mastered through
quantification, it would be possible to act on these laws. This was taken in two directions:
physical causes were attributed to social phenomena, and social causes were attributed to
physical disorders. The former gave rise to eugenics, and beyond that to racism and Nazism,
saying that one should forbid ill people to reproduce, or those who where not successful
socially. We should remember that in the Nordic countries, there was legislation of this sort right
until 1965, with forced sterilisations. The most atrocious forms were the extermination of those
considered unfit. All of this was based on the idea of a scientific and quantified representation of
the world. People reasoned that if you behave badly - they did not say bad genes at the time,
but the wrong race - the unhealthy elements must be eliminated so that humanity can progress.
The other current was those who said, on the contrary, if there are ill people, alcoholics, it is
because they are unemployed, or do not have good conditions, so one must act on the social
causes to see an improvement in physical conditions. This was the origin of the Social State. So
the Social State is itself a large-scale expression of this idea of using numbers to justify
legislation. Chapter 3 - THE UNHOLY UNION OF CAPITALISM AND COMMUNISM The Soviet
Heritage The unholy union of communism and capitalism was a theme which I treated briefly in
a previous book, "The Spirit of Philadelphia". I wanted to come back to it because I think it is
important for understanding what happened after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and ten years before
that, with the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, which in my view are as important, and they are earlier
and thus premonitory, as the fall of the Berlin Wall. Generally, these events are seen as the
victory of capitalism over communism, but if we take a closer look, what happens is rather a
phenomenon of hybridisation, which gives different results in different countries, but among
which one can detect common features. To do so, we must return to the Soviet experience and
Lenin, who actually had no particular economic doctrine - he was influenced by a German writer
- and who devised economic plans. Soviet planning was the idea of a centralised calculation of
collective utility, which was carried out by the government of the Soviet Union, and this would
make the country as a whole progress, and increase the common good. The key institution for
this planning was the Gosplan (State Planning Committee). The Soviet Union developed a
gigantic system of statistics, and on the basis of this data a draft quantified plan was dispatched
starting from the centre and moving down to the periphery, through a myriad of intermediary
institutions, then there were commentaries on these plans, feedack, and on the basis of these
replies, the plan itself was drawn up, and this plan was sent out again in the form of legallybinding
directives. This is where law came in, in the form of these directives, but they were
simply the transposition of a set of calculations. So this was not governance, but government by
numbers, since there was still the distinction between governing and governed, leaders - who
were the avant-garde of the working class, who paraded for all to see on Red Square - and the
mass of workers who had to achieve by carrying out these directives, the figures and goals. The
goals were expressed in terms of control figures, which were a kind of macro figures. To give
one example, the Shanghai Classification, which is behind almost all reforms in French
universities, - making bigger and bigger units in order to move up in the Shanghai Classification
- is a direct derivative of Soviet planning and its large control figures. Seeing its influence today
on the orientation of research should raise a few eyebrows. The Capitulation of European
Justice In the case of the Court of Justice of the European Union, among others, we see the
result of applying the idea of governance by numbers to the law, in the form of the "Law and
Economics" theory. This doctrine was developed first at Chicago, in the wake of Milton
Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics. A certain number of legal theorists, amongst
them Richard Posner, argued that every rule can be the object of a calculation of utility. To know
what the right rule is, we must make this type of calculation. This is how the case-law of the
European Court of Justice works. So there is no intangible rule, everything must be weighed up,
which is called the principle of proportionality. One of the most caricatural expressions of this
method is found in the "Viking ruling", which labour lawyers know well because here the Court
of Justice submitted the right to strike and the right of assembly to a calculation of their
economic utility. The "Viking ruling" said that the principle of human dignity must be made
compatible with the principles of free competition and free entreprise. Whereas in the thinking of
the great renewal of dogma, at the end of the Second World War, and in its majors texts, the
principle of dignity was intangible, as it is in the German Constitution where, as a result of
constitutional reforms, it is forbidden to challenge it. So one can see that this machine of utility
calculations forces everything into an economic calculation. This is a very good example of how
the Court of Justice thinks. But one could also take the example of the Constitutional Council's
case-law in France today. The European Community, when that was still its name, had agreed
on common social rules, called Social Europe, which was one of the declared goals of the
Community, and the only ones who did not want them were the British, but the entry of the
former Communist countries into the EU completely destroyed the balance, particularly in the
composition of the Court of Justice, because these countries inherited a Soviet-style attitude, in
which law is there to serve the economy. So there was a conversion to neoliberalism which
could be done very quickly because there was not much respect for the law. Tzvetan Todorov
summarises this well: it was a system in which everything was negotiable, ideology was nothing
but a fiction. So there was a general conversion to the most extreme forms of liberalism in these
countries, and it is arguable that this is one of the reasons why the Court, which had been very
prudent - since its legitimacy was very weak - became very hostile to common social rules if
they laid the groundwork for systems of solidarity. This inversion can also be seen with China
and Russia. For example in China, in the Constitution under Deng Xiaoping, it is stated that no
one shall disturb the economic order of society. This applies perfectly to the case-law of the
European Court of Justice which we just mentioned. You can have social legislation as long as
it does not affect the economic priorities. So the economic order is in some sense
constitutionalised. In the case of France, much could be said about how the upper civil service
embraced the virtues of the market, despite their lack of experience in this area, and this
produced a number of financial disasters which were paid for by the tax-payer. One could
compare - but this is sociology rather than law - what happened there and what occurred in the
Soviet Union, where the oligarchy transformed rapidly from managing huge public enterprises to
managing huge amounts of private capital. Something comparable occurred in France, where
the upper civil service previously served the State impartially, what Pierre Legendre, well before
Pierre Bourdieu, called the "State nobility", but then this ethos of the "State nobility" was
seduced by the market model, with bankable advantages, because when you move from the
salary of a high civil servant to the salary of a privatised company, you obviously earn a lot
more. So one can see in this development, in the way things work today in Bercy (France's
Finance Ministry), in this permeability between the world of finance and the French upper civil
service, something comparable to what occurred with the Soviet oligarchy. Chapter 4 - THE
LIMITS OF GOVERNANCE BY NUMBERS Heteronomy as the Condition of Freedom What the
long history of law and institutions has shown us is that one cannot have autonomy for each
human being in the absence of a common, heteronomous framework. The most obvious
example is the ability to express oneself. It is impossible to express ourselves freely - if only to
make stirring calls to total revolution against the injustice of the world order - without first
accepting the law of language, that is, without speaking a particular language. The language we
learnt as a child was something heteronomous for us. Only if I accept this heteronomy of
language do I become a subject able to express himself or herself freely. Without this
heteronomy of language, I remain at the stage of gurglings which no one else can understand.
And in that case, I cannot claim to act freely. The same is true for the organisation of society: a
common law must exist, in order that each person may be empowered to act freely. If you
destroy this common law, and the dominion of the law comes to an end, each person will
appear to have autonomy but in reality each is abandoned to the whim of someone stronger, or
will try to dominate someone weaker. What develops in this context is what I call ties of
allegiance. Thus what looks like generalised autonomy in fact creates the conditions for a return
of ties of allegiance as the contemporary form of the legal bond. The New Forms of Autonomy
The notion of "subject", which is very complex, and untranslatable into many Oriental languages
- it is a big problem in Japanese, that the same word can refer both to a grammatical and to a
psychological figure - etymologically, it is Subjectum, "thrown under". This idea is present when,
to affirm myself as an individual subject, I must respect a heteronomous rule. To take a concrete
example, the new technologies enable all people to express themselves using the social media,
but this will only produce collective conformity, unless each person has acquired a certain
culture with which they can act and think freely and independently of the others. So what
remains of the subject in a cybernetic universe? Nothing but a point, which reacts to signals.
You receive signals from your environment, and you must adjust to these signals to carry out
your programme. The ultra-modern subject, in this light, looks sadly like an extinction of
freedom. Your behaviour can be programmed because we know that you are going to behave in
accordance with a calculation of your private interests. All is reduced to what I call contracting
particles motivated by self-interested calculations of utility. This would be one possible figure of
modernity. The Harm Caused by "New Public Management" The State, as the central figure of
our political order, represents the heteronomous instance which takes responsibility for what is
not calculable in human lives. For example, people's identity, since the State guarantees
personal status, and the honouring of promises. These domains were entrusted to the State.
And it is because there was this heteronomous, vertical dimension of the incalculable that
another plane could develop, where individuals are free to act solely by calculation, the plane of
the market and the contract. So you have, in a sense, the vertical plane of the law and the
horizontal plane of the contract, but the two are inseparable. Represented like this, the State
cannot be confused with an economic operator acting in the plane of the contract. It ensures
that this plane of the market functions correctly. But if you treat the State as itself an economic
operator, as New Public Management does - New Public Management says that you must apply
to the State and to the domestic economy the same rules as those applied in a private business
- this is a way of abolishing the distinction between the two planes. Everything becomes flat.
This vision of the world as perfectly flat was imagined by an English novelist, Edwin Abbott, in
the late 19th century, who wrote a clever little tale called "Flat Land", where he imagines a world
in which only two-dimensional beings exists. Such a world is unsustainable in the long run. This
means that New Public Management, by undermining the heteronomy of the political order, will
force private operators to take on what the State has abandoned, that is, the non-calculable.
One of the expressions of this is corporate responsibility. In a political order which functions as I
explained just now, where the law reigns and the State functions well, the State sees to longterm
environmental protection, and businesses can concentrate solely on making profits. In this
light, when Milton Friedman, one of the founders of the Chicago School, says that a company's
only corporate responsibility is making money, I am not shocked by this, as long as the business
pays its taxes and obeys all the social and environmental legislation. However, If the State is
disempowered, then inevitably the corporate sector is considered to be responsible for the
social and environmental issues it encounters. So there is a movement of privatisation of the
public sphere, as well as a movement of "publicisation" of the private sphere. Suffering at Work
Simone Weil's compelling descriptions of industrial labour show how mind-numbing this type of
work was, because workers were forbidden to think, and were enslaved to a stultifying,
mechanical repetition of tasks. This was clearly a form of alienation. With our new types of
management, the issue is different. The aim is now to control people's mental functioning.
Robert Castel was one of the first in France to identify this, he called it "therapy for the normal",
the fact that psychological techniques are used to ensure that workers execute programmes
well. This gave rise to new management techniques, some of which were qualitative, such as
appraisal interviews, which have become a standard rite in all organisations, including the public
sector. Appraisal interviews are those moments of feedback where together you measure the
performance you have achieved, and then you readjust the objectives accordingly. But at the
same time, one can say that the appraisal interview is a form of dispossession in the sense that
it is like confession, where you confess what you did, the difficulties you encountered, and your
successes, and you must therefore bare your heart to your manager. The difference is that in
traditional confession you examine your conscience in order to regain self-possession, whereas
here you have to bare all in order to reset objectives and be reprogrammed. And this can
amount to a new form of dispossession even if it is not always that. It is always on a knife-edge,
with these new management methods, which bring possibilities of emancipation but also risks of
dehumanisation of work. The Denial of Reality Genuinely human work is work where the human
mind, and the images it invents, can engage with the real. It is an experience in which workers
both learn about themselves and show what they are capable of doing. This is genuninely
human work, and in my lectures I tried to show that there are two forms of dehumanisation, not
just one. There is the form which was incriminated at the end of the industrial era, when you
reduce human work to the work of an animal or a machine. But there is another form, when you
enclose the human being in a system of representation entirely divorced from any experience of
reality. There are some pathological cases, like the Kerviel affair, where financial whizz-kids are
so immersed in a quantified world of symbols that they lose all contact with reality, but they can
cause real disasters which have a tremendous impact. This enclosure within systems of
symbols divorced from reality - and we should recall the meaning of symbol here because
normally the symbol is precisely what links a sign to a concrete and real object - and when the
link is broken, people become enclosed within systems of representation devoid of meaning. In
such cases, there are only too options: fraud, or depression, madness. In Kerviel's case there
was a bit of both, and in a recent case, the Volkswagen affair, you clearly have engineers faced
with two incompatible quantified commands: "it must not cost more than x" and "it must not
pollute more than y", and their solution was to invent a computer programme which could cheat.
They thus incurred risks for the company, the public, and the environment which were
enormous. In other words, they entirely separated the map from the territory. Chapter 5 - THE
DECLINE OF THE STATE The Public / Private Hierarchy Overturned To address the issue of
the withering-away of the State, we should first recall that it was a theme introduced by the
founding fathers of Marxism. Friedrich Engels prophesised that the State would disappear of its
own accord, as soon as society conformed to the laws of scientific socialism. Hence the State
was destined to disappear as soon as Communism got into its stride. It is striking to see that
challenges to the role of the State, which started in the 19th century, because the State was
considered to be a metaphysical entity which had no real function in a positivist vision of the
world, those challenges have resurfaced today, due to the return, in a new guise, of liberalism.
To understand this moment, we must also remember that Western democracies were able to
win out over totalitarian regimes partly because of the invention of the Social State. In this light,
the famous speech by Franklin Roosevelt, on "the four freedoms", is very striking. There is an
island in New York which commemorates this speech, in which Roosevelt says that those who
defend democracy cannot suffer from want. People who suffer from want are the breedingground
of dictatorships. So you have to have enough to eat to know that you are fighting for
something. So the State expanded, and it was acclaimed as a protector, and so, on the
economic front, it was the Keynesians who developed that. The neoliberals - of which one of the
most remarkable and talented, and the most interesting for jurists, because he trained in law,
was Friedrich Hayek - their idea was precisely to abolish the preeminent place of the State and
say that what should be at the top of any normative construction is three things: private
property, contractual freedom and legal liability. These three had already been mentioned by
David Hume, as the three fundamental laws which one can derive from observing nature. So the
idea was that there was a spontaneous order, the order of the market, which is universally valid
and is grounded universally on respect for the three fundamental laws. And the role of the State
is to support and respect this universal order of the market. This is what I call the utopia of a
total market, where there would be universal and almost timeless rules, and where States would
deal with local problems only. Several legal innovations have reinforced this ideology. One of
them was the creation of the World Trade Organisation in the 1990s which aimed precisely at
subjecting all States to a certain number of rules, which are basically rules from private law. This
overturns the public-private hierarchy, because in the previous order of the Social State,
freedom of enterprise and of the markets was preserved, but under the supervision of the State,
which was responsible for social cohesion and systems of solidarity. Today, the overturned
hierarchy makes economic freedoms into the higher rule. Solidarities are admitted only as
exceptions to that rule. They are only tolerated, more or less. The other figures which show this
inversion are European institutions. They too are built on the almost constitutional assertion of
economic freedoms, while States are in charge of local solidarities only, and then only through
exemptions, and as long as economic freedoms, with their almost constitutional value, are not
affected The Rana Plaza Disaster With globalisation, multinationals can escape particular
national legislations and regard them from the perspective of forum shopping, setting up
wherever the legislation is most advantageous to them. So they can largely elude the public
authorities. But they find themselves in a kind of legal void, where they are accountable, but no
judge is able to hear their case. I shall take a concrete example. Two or three years ago, a
disaster occurred at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh - I went into greater depth in my lectures -,
where a textile factory collapsed. It had not respected any security regulations, and 1,000 young
women working there died crushed in that factory. They had asked not to go back inside
because there were signs of danger, but they were forced to, with the threat that otherwise they
would lose their jobs. It transpired that this company worked for many major Western brands,
both European and American, and people immediately said: these companies must take
responsibility. They are held responsible for what is one of the largest industrial accidents in
recent history. I happened to meet one of the top managers of a French firm involved in this
case, and he said to me "people are just trying to blackmail us, it is not true, it is not us ...". Who
is right? In this case, we need a judge, but there is no judge at an international level. So the
company exposes and risks its reputation - which is a very precious thing in today's world -
without there being a judge to turn to. And in some respects corporate social responsibility is
successful because it protects a company's moral position without a binding law. But in my view,
this is not sustainable in the long term. The Reemergence of the Logic of Friend / Enemy The
reign of the law, in which all people recognise each other as equal before a common law - which
is how a political community is achieved - when this is destroyed, one of the effects is a situation
in which people look for an internal enemy. I come back to Carl Schmitt here, who says that
what is properly political is identifying the enemy, being able to identify the enemy. He thought
the Friend / Enemy logic had a universal value because the political community only constitutes
itself by designating an enemy, whether outside its frontiers or within them. And he says this is a
question of life and death. To my mind, Carl Schmitt does not get to the bottom of the issue of
law. Law is something other than establishing an order through violence or force. Law is what
makes subjects believe in a common heteronomous reference. And if this acknowledgment that
we are all subjects of the same law disappears, the public sphere fragments and the population
realigns in terms of Friend / Enemy. The Friend / Enemy theory explains moments of
institutional crisis where precisely there is no shared faith in the same law, and people regroup
according to affinities, and by naming an enemy. This is revealing because the return of the
Friend / Enemy logic is a symptom of a crisis in our legal frameworks. This return is visible at
every level, particularly in the way public debate today abandons argumentation, and
degenerates into verbal attacks. In public debate in the public sphere, as it appeared in the 18th
century, and as Jürgen Habermas has theorised it, we all hold the belief that through reasoned
argument with others we can achieve a better common representation of society. With verbal
attacks, by contrast, the aim is to find elements which will destroy our opponent. And
unfortunately what is called public debate is increasingly becoming a free for all, which is a
symptom of this institutional crisis. Chapter 6 - THE ABUSE OF WORK Total Mobilisation,
1914-1918 The First World War was an event of the utmost importance in every respect, and it
can be seen as the beginning of a 30 years' war which ended in 1945. It was also, in itself, the
very first experiment in what can be called the industrial management of human material. For
the war effort, and in order to bring supplies to the front, and reinforcements, which were
consumed in a way comparable to market consumption, as Jünger observed, Taylorist
techniques were used which until then had only been employed locally. For the requirements of
the war, these were generalised. As one of the sensitive souls who did not return from the war
unscathed, and among all those who later wrote about their experience of the War, one of the
most remarkable witnesses was certainly Ernst Jünger in his attempts to make sense of his
experience. He was a Prussian aristocrat who saw a world collapse, and he tried to make sense
of it, and he also diagnosed lucidly the radical novelty of this war in relation to previous wars,
saying that with these new methods there was not a single seamstress, in her far-flung village,
who did not participate in some way or other in the war effort. There was total mobilisation,
"Mobilmachung", which characterised this new way of waging war. From Total War to the Total
Market In order to confirm the relevance still today of this idea of total mobilisation, - I didn't do
so in my lecture because I thought about it just recently - one could look at a speech by David
Cameron who, as British Prime Minister, presented his political programme to the British people
explaining that we were in a "global race". This implies a deadly race, where we will either sink
or swim. So this political project is a kind of generalised Darwinism where the only way ahead is
through combat: you survive, at the expense of your neighbour, or you disappear. But the
"global race" David Cameron was thinking about was evidently the competitive race on the
international markets, and the total market here replaces the total war of 1914. With the return
of this theme of total mobilisation, we have the abandonment of the idea which appeared at the
end of this 30 years' war, in 1945 - in several founding texts like the Declaration of Philadelphia,
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the first plan for an international trade
organisation - the idea that one should reconstruct an international legal order based on
collaboration between nations. This model was rejected by Northern countries on several
occasions, since they did not want to show international solidarity with Southern countries, and
they pushed for making the competition of all against all into the norm in international relations.
This was finally enshrined by the WTO. And this led to the idea of a "global race" and the return
of the idea of total mobilisation: Sunday too, including night work. Women's night work has
increased by 100% in 15 years in France. We now know that the effects of night work on the
health of both men and women are particularly alarming. So today we are in this atmosphere,
that we must mobilise workers, eliminate all limits on working hours, again in this atmosphere of
total mobilisation, no longer in the framework of a war of weapons, but an economic war.
Reformism and Transformism: the Lessons of Bruno Trentin I had the good fortune to meet
Bruno Trentin, and I had a strong friendship with him. His biography is particularly interesting
because his father was the only law professor to have refused to swear allegiance to Mussolini.
He was brought up in the South of France, with a double French and Italian culture, and was
one of the great Italian Trade Union leaders of the 1970s, and one of the agents of the
destalinisation of the Italian Left. Towards the end of his life - rather despondently, as he told me
- he was a member of the European Parliament. He wrote a major book called "The 'polis' of
Work". It is important because in it Trentin retrieved all the debates circulating under Fordism, in
the aftermath of the First World War. The question confronting the political and trade union Left
at the time was: "Why do we fight?" It was an important question because without a mobilising
force and the idea of a better society, no political struggle is possible. This is one of the
problems in our current crisis. On this issue, Trentin opposed reformism and transformism. A
reformist politics asks what world one wants to build, and then tries to find the political means to
this end; whereas transformism is a term taken from Italian politics, but it can be transposed into
France, it is the politics of changing tack and adjusting in order to keep hold of power. We have
several examples of this in France - I do not need to specify. So the question posed for the
political and union Left after the First World War was whether the new forms of organisation of
work, Taylorist forms, which stultify workers, whose whole life is spent enslaved to a machine,
monitored by the foreman, with no right to innovate, is that acceptable? He describes the
debates on this subject. Some said "no", the real goal of social justice is to enable every worker
to have humane conditions of labour. I take this expression from the Preamble to the
Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, written in 1919. This position, represented
in France by Simone Weil, said that this was the greatest injustice, reducing entire human
masses to the state of mindless herds. More generally people said, including in the Soviet
Union, that it was the price to pay for technological modernity. It has the blessing of science.
The scope of social justice was thus reduced simply to quantitative issues, compensation: what
price can I obtain in return for this life devoid of meaning, which I must surrender to my
company? At what price and for how long? So I try to reduce the length of time, and that is the
theme of the working day; and I increase the price, and that is the theme of salaries; and I
ensure my physical safety. Demands for social justice included these three basic elements of all
the demands for social justice. This gave rise to the concept of employment. The notion of
employment is this sort of exchange, where I abandon all forms of freedom in my work, and I
agree to be alienated, because that is progress, but on the other hand, not for too long and I will
be well paid, I will receive a pension, etc. This was the pact on which the modern Social State
was founded. And Bruno Trentin saw clearly that this pact was disintegrating, and this is what
brought us together, the need to get beyond a defensive attitude and to open up new
perspectives for mobilisation and seize the opportunities for greater freedom and more humane
work provided by new ways of organising work Corporate Social Responsibility Concerning
responsibility, the real problem is that in the ties of allegiance we have described, if we take an
economic example, international productions chains, where a t-shirt on sale in Paris is the
product of a manufacturing chain involving workers in Tunisia, Bangladesh, etc. These
production chains make it possible for those who hold economic power to get advantages from
this type of organisation without having to be accountable for the damage it can cause. This
possibility of disconnecting the positions of power from the positions to which responsibility can
be imputed is a major problem. And it is not simple to resolve because we are used to thinking
that there is one person responsible. But, on these production chains, if we look at the Rana
Plaza case again, the bosses were absolute rogues because they knowingly put these women's
lives at risk through naked greed and criminal attitudes. So there is no good reason why these
people should get away with it on the pretext that they were working under pressure from the
big companies, which preferred not to know about the working conditions of these workers. The
problem is identifying responsibility in networks of allegiance, and linking the degree of
responsibility to the degree of power held. And also defining a figure with ultimate responsibility.
Because even if one cannot find the others, there must be someone who is accountable, and in
general, in the last instance, it is the company director. We have some examples of possible
solutions, for example in European law, for cases of liability for defective products, where one
can work back up the chain to find the company which first put the product into circulation. So
bonds do exist between different agents in the economic chain. The Decline of Solidarity
Solidarity is perceived as an enemy by neoliberal ideology. Friedrich Hayek states clearly that it
is an atavistic remainder which should be done away with, because we are heading for a world
he calls catallaxy, that is, "globalisation" in opposition to "worldisation". "Globalisation" is where
the globe is peopled by contracting particles which maximise their utilities individually, which
interact, and in order for this interaction to function well, the three fundamental laws must be
respected: property, liability and the binding force of contracts. Apart from these, nothing must
hamper the fluidity of the system. Systems of solidarity are regarded as clots in the blood
stream, to be destroyed. This is why neoliberalism keeps attacking freedom of association and
the right to strike, which in its view are particularly vexatious forms of solidarity. Also public
service agencies, insofar as public services represent monopolies which resist this generalised
competition. So the dominant trend is to dismantle the established forms of solidarity which had
been instituted by the Social State. If you dismantle these systems, the need to find protectors
and to count on people for help does not go away, but it reappears as religious, tribal or ethnic,
identity-based solidarities. This analysis sheds light on the present situation, in which there is a
collapse and an indictment of all the systems of solidarity established by the Social State, and
on the other hand, there reappear particularist, ethnic, identity-based solidarities, which are
rarely peace-loving because they are mostly solidarities of combat. This is why we should not
sacralise solidarity as such. We saw, with the '14-'18 War, how Darwinism embraced Solidarity
by transposing the war of all against all from the individual to the group. So one should not
sacralise it, but one should not think one can just do away with it either. So once again we are
faced with the question: how rethink systems of solidarity so that they harmonise with the
present state of our customs, cultures, and technology, in all their diversity and on the scale of
the world. This is the agenda for a real "worldisation". Chapter 7 - FROM THE DECLINE OF
THE LAW TO NEW TIES OF ALLEGIANCE The Return of Ties of Allegiance One of the
paradoxes of the quest for an impersonal form of power, running human affairs on automatic
pilot, a quest already present in the order of the law, because the law could represent an
impersonal figure, and even more so now with governance by numbers - the paradox is that this
quest made forms of personal dependence reappear. There are two reasons for this. The first is
that the way of thinking, in the case of work, but as we saw this can be transposed into relations
between companies, or between more and less powerful States, is to say "I set you objectives, I
give you a sphere of autonomy, but you are accountable, and you must exercise this autonomy
for my benefit". This structure of modern management is exactly what in Medieval law was
called "tenure-service". Tenure-service means "I shall grant you a holding, I who am your
suzerain, and you will manage it autonomously - a fief for nobles and censive tenure for
commoners - and you will manage it for my benefit". This structure of tenure-service
corresponds quite precisely to management by objectives. This is the first reason why one can
say that allegiance has returned. It is this structure and today's ways of thinking about work that
bring back allegiance. Another reason is that the weakening of the figure of "the same law for
everyone", the weakening of the figure of the State, this withering-away of the State, its ability to
offer protection, especially the Social State which promised everyone security at every moment,
this weakening obliges those who are most affected by the disappearance of the State as a
tutelary and protective figure to look elsewhere for guarantees. To survive in these
environments where a common law no longer prevails, one must pledge allegiance to someone
stronger than oneself. One must find a protector, whom in return one pledges to serve. These
ties of allegiance are operative at every level, in relations between companies of different
strengths, between workers and managers, and also in the relations between countries. During
the Greek financial crisis, Greece was requested to pledge allegiance to its EU partners. If you
read the text Greece was obliged to sign in July 2015, it says, "Yes, it's all my fault". The Greeks
were made to sign that if Greece had an unmanageable level of debt, it was exclusively due to
the policies introduced since January 2015, which is utterly untrue. But they had to perform this
act of submission so that later they would be granted a loan. When dealing with the Greek
deficit, the Troika, that is, the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank
decided on the fate of the Greeks using methods which far exceeded the normal powers of
European institutions over a Member State. But this was precisely an effect of what we saw with
New Public Management, that is, treating a State like a business. When a businessman goes
bankrupt, he is forbidden to continue trading, and in the case of Greece, one said that the Greek
people should have no say in the matter. They had been put into receivership. So the Troika
acted like a sort of receiver. And one can see how this idea of governance by numbers
flagrantly contradicts the idea of democracy. So these ties of allegiance shape every level of our
institutions, which is why the concept seemed to me to have a particularly powerful operative
force. Rule by Men and Rule by Laws We have seen that a Mediaeval structure resurfaces, but
this does not mean that we are returning to the Middle Ages. It means that, in the history of law,
there are a limited number of ways of thinking about human government, and when one of them
is exhausted, another one appears. Some notions are recycled, such as "citizenship", which one
can see in Ancient Greece, it is reinterpreted differently in Rome, and again in the Italian City
States at the dawn of modern times, then during the French Revolution, and then in the 1980s
Auroux Laws, which speak of "citizenship in the work-place". Each time the concept has a
different meaning. So it is not that we are returning to the Middle Ages, but that a certain
structure is reappearing. Because there are not that many ways of governing people. Here I
borrow terms from Chinese political philosophy, where rule founded on laws was distinguished
from rule by men. For Confucius, the ideal was that people assimilated the rules of good
conduct to such an extent that they did not need laws. That was government by men, in the
form of ritualism. Its opposite was government by laws, where a common law applies to
everyone. Apart from ritualism, feudalism was another form of rule by men. It works through a
bond of personal allegiance, where I become the vassal of my suzerain, who gives me
protection. This form had different versions in different societies. There is a magnificent work by
the great historian Marc Bloch on feudal society which is well worth rereading because it shows
how this feudal structure was expressed very differently in different parts of Europe. Perry
Anderson also does this type of comparative work, in "Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism",
showing how important Japanese feudalism was in Japan's economic successes at the end of
the last century because they knew how to get the best out of this bond through employment for
life: I give you life-long employment, but you must serve me faithfully, that was one of the keys
to Japan's economic success. It did not take the legal form which existed in Europe, where
feudalism developed in the matrix of Roman law. And within Europe itself, English, French and
German feudalism were different. An in-depth study would certainly reveal this same type of
diversity. And in the case of France, there is an old feudal substratum which can resurface at
any moment in forms which are in keeping with the French tradition. In order not to give the
impression, which would be false, that this diagnosis of a revival of ties of allegiance reflects a
certain pessimism, I must stress the fact that unlike the fantasies around the total market, as
something universal, homogeneous, and a homogenisation of systems, from the perspective of
"worldisation" as I have tried to define it the issue is rather for every society to get the best out
of its own tradition. That is to say, to invent its modernity on the basis of its own tradition. In the
case of France, in the long history of French legal culture, there are certain resources which can
be mobilised. Instead of this, the tendency today is to use comparative law in much the same
way that Dr Frankenstein used surgery, that is, thinking one can graft an English head onto
German muscles, with a Swedish heart... No. The problem is to regain confidence in a certain
tradition, while not getting enclosed in a fantasised representation of national identity, but also
not yielding to the idea that now there is only one way of governing and it should be imported
into France. This is very important, and it links with the issue of reform today: how can one best
use a legal tradition to tackle the problems of the modern world? An Example from France:
Reforming the Labour Code It was foreseeable, and already mentioned in the 1999 report,
"Beyond Employment", that the single currency would reduce the scope of Member States'
economic action to one adjustment variable, namely labour costs. The rest was not under a
country's control. There was only this one leverage, to which they clung absolutely frantically,
thinking that with this alone they could adjust to international competition. "Adjust" here means
ever lower standards of social protection. So when I saw a politician on television throw a huge
French Labour Code in a very theatrical gesture onto the table - in fact it was in fact the Code
with commentaries - saying "This is the origin of all of France's ills", it was entirely foreseeable.
But I also thought it was irresponsible and showed a lack of political perspective, of
contextualisation of problems, because the labour law we inherited from the industrial world was
conceived for employment, and corresponded to a system of production which is no longer ours.
We must rethink and reformulate the categories of our labour law. It cannot simply be dreamt up
by academics. One of the problems of the 2016 El Khomri labour reform was that it was based
on expert analyses and not on negotiation. Labour law has always been based on practice, that
is, on the experimental knowledge which business leaders and employees via their trade unions
have of the world of work. That is where reforms can really take root. The Labour Code's first
article, which derives from the Larcher Law, actually makes it obligatory for every labour law
reform to be preceded by cross-industry negotiations. But in the case of the El Khomri Law, first
came the experts and afterwards, to expiate this original error, there was a succession of
negotiations with different trade unions. So it got off on the wrong foot from the start. In the
debates on this reform, if I were to make value judgements, with politicians who get the
advantages of both the public and the private sector, there is an oligarchic tendency. Seeing
them indict the working class's excessive privileges is something obscene, clearly. When one
moves from the upper civil service to banking, while keeping the safety of one and the financial
advantages of the other, attacking the extravagant entitlements of post-office workers or nurses,
and always blaming what remains of the public services in France, it always means pointing the
finger, setting immigrants against the others, old against young, pensioners against the working
population, insiders against outsiders, this is the result of a breakdown, an incapacity to shape
an agenda for political mobilisation valid for all citizens. It is another symptom of the crisis of the
political, of our "living together". No Social Harmony without Social Justice How can one, to use
the terms of the cybernetic imaginary again, reconnect the political to experience? This notion of
experience is very important. Often one regards issues of social justice as a sort of illusory
dream, the stuff of boy scouts and pious preachers. actual fact, the principle of social justice
was formally advocated on two occasions in the course of the 20th century, once in 1919, and
the other time in 1944, that is, following unimaginable butchery and mass murder. And it was
asserted twice, first in the Treaty of Versailles, and then in the Declaration of Philadelphia, that
"universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice". One
foreseeable consequence of a world in which injustices keep growing is that there will be
violence. In what form? In wars, it was violence between countries, but now novel forms of
violence appear before our very eyes, but they are to a certain extent foreseeable. What is very
striking in the Declaration of Philadelphia and in the Universal Declaration is that they are
explicit: "Historical experience has shown that if we let injustices flourish, we will have war." So
reconnecting the political to lived experience seems to me to be an absolute priority, in order to
avert this possibility. So we have before us a mammoth task, in which, first of all, populations
must be enabled to reappropriate the political sphere. It should not be confiscated by experts,
nor by a class of political careerists, which cannot see the map for the territory, which has lost
touch with people's real experience.
