According to Ronald Coase himself, the expression “Coase theorem” was not coined by him, but by George
Stigler (cf. Coase, 1993, p. 249).

A factor of production (or its owner) does not have to enter into a series of
contracts with the factors with which it is cooperating within a firm, as would
be necessary, of course, if this cooperation took place as a result of the
functioning of price mechanisms. . A single contract replaces a series of others
(Coase, 1937, p. 391).

A more detailed and exemplified explanation of transaction costs is given by Coase in The problem of
social costs: “To carry out market transactions it is necessary to find out who you want to negotiate with,
inform people that you want to negotiate and on what terms, conduct negotiations that lead to an agreement, draft the
contract, carry out the necessary inspection to ensure that the terms of the contract are being observed,
and so on. These operations are often quite costly, costly enough to preclude many transactions from
taking place that would be conducted in a world where the price system operated costlessly.” (Coase,

Initially, Director taught the Economic Analysis and Public Policy course,
essentially a price theory course, but he was later invited by Edward Levi
to collaborate on the antitrust course. After an attempt to teach together,
they decided to divide the lessons into four days for Levi and one for
Director. What happened was described by some who took the course.
Wesley Leiberler said this: “For four days each week, Ed Levi would
approach the law and use traditional techniques of legal reasoning to relate
cases to each other, and create a synthesis of the kind that jurists are
accustomed to explaining and rationalizing cases. cases. It was a
considerable feat. For four days, Ed would do this, and for one day each
week, Aaron Director would tell us that everything Levi had told us over the
previous four days was nonsense. He used economic analysis to show us
that legal analysis simply didn’t hold up.” [...] From then on, the superiority
of legal economic analysis, at least in the area of antitrust, became firmly
established at the University of Chicago Law School. (Coase, 1993, p. 247 – emphasis added)

(1) individuals are rational maximizers of their satisfactions in their behavior
outside and inside markets; (2) individuals respond to price incentives in their
behavior outside and inside markets; and (3) legal rules and legal outcomes

(Mercuro; Medema, 1997, p. 57)

“Rationality means [...] the willingness to choose, consciously or unconsciously, a means capable of
achieving whatever objectives the maker of the choice has in view. [...] It does not presuppose
consciousness, and it certainly does not presuppose omniscience.” (Posner, 2003, p. 17)
In an alternative but convergent description, Ejan Mackaay breaks down these same assumptions into
four fundamental premises: (i) methodological individualism; (ii) rational choice; (iii) stable preferences
and (iv) the use of the notion of market equilibrium (Mackaay, 2000, p. 408-9).
Of course, there are exceptions, such as the “economic analysis of crime” carried out by Shikida and

It is easy to see why the rule in contract law is non-intervention in the
freedom of the parties. According to the Coase Theorem, the parties'
agreement tends, in fact, to socially efficient solutions. Thus, state
intervention will only make sense when it leads to better and more efficient
solutions than the parties' agreement alone could achieve. (Timm; Guarisse, 2012, p. 174)

Another example of second-order adverse effects from state interference in the will of the parties
is provided by the authors: “In many cases the legislator's interventions seem to favor a certain
group, but a deeper analysis shows that this alleged benefit carries with it a cost . An example is the
application, in Germany, of the European Directive [...] which determines the seller's liability for
defects in used cars for a period of one year after purchase. This resulted in a significant increase in
the price of used cars in Germany, as car dealers would now need to take out insurance to protect
themselves from possible claims.” (Timm; Guarisse, 2012, p. 177-8)

any area of private law, including property and contracts, is not recognized
as an efficient tool for redistributive policies because it often entails four
groups of undesirable flaws: (1) risks of imprecise targets (hitting the

correspond to the initial objective); (3) high transaction costs; and (4)

When a magistrate in an eviction process decides to protect the elderly
who have not paid the rent for some time (the supposedly weaker party) to
the detriment of the landlords (the supposedly stronger party), even with
the good intention of doing social justice, he signals to everyone other

in cases where the individual does not have incentives to use arbitration in
dispute resolution, his choice for state jurisdiction will depend on the
efficiency of judicial institutions. The inefficiency of the state courts will be
an incentive for the individual to resolve their disputes by changing their
business standards, in order to avoid or make legal disputes unnecessary.
Potentially, this process even involves reducing economic activity as a
whole [to avoid dispute settlement costs]. (Salama, 2012, p. 388)

First, arbitration may reduce transaction costs directly related to dispute
resolution. Secondly, arbitration can favor the establishment of a more
adequate incentive system for the fulfillment of contracts, maximizing gains
in the contractual relationship between the parties. (Salama, 2012, p. 383)

The basic hypothesis that I bring here is that the dynamics of the supply
and demand relationship for dispute resolution services has contours
similar to those of supply and demand for products and services in the
markets. Microeconomic theory suggests that, in markets, competition
generally leads to lower prices. Likewise, I will argue that competition
between the state model and the private model can reduce transaction
costs in providing the dispute resolution service. (Salama, 2012, p. 388)

intervention is expected to be able to correct them, although it may not be successful in all

“Since the creation of the Doing Business project by the Private Sector Development Group of
the World Bank (WB), the Law and Finance literature has come to play a prominent role in the
practical field of legal reforms, since its methods of measuring the quality of the law were adopted
to support comparative research on the business environment in World Bank member countries.
They thus began to influence investment decisions by private actors and the BM itself. As a result,
the rules valued as inducing financial development began to be taken as a reference by national
reformers who intended to create better conditions for private investment, especially by those who
demanded resources from the World Bank for the implementation of these reforms. Recently, this
has been reinforced by the fact that other areas of the WB have started to adopt the indicators of the
Doing Business project to assess the impact of reforms financed by the World Bank.” (Fabiani, 2011, p. 53-4)

Although he does not specifically refer to the influence of the Law & Finance movement, João
Márcio Mendes Pereira's thesis on the World Bank highlights the instrumental role that banners such
as "good governance" played for the Bank, in the sense of "providing an apparently technique for
[...] transforming Eastern European countries and the former USSR into 'market economies'”, as well
as promoting reforms in developing countries (cf. Pereira, 2009, p. 208 and passim). The pretense of

Milhaupt and Pistor point out that “extralegal devices” operating in Japan, South Korea and China
can “serve as a foundation for economic success, at least to some extent.” (2009, p. 39) Among
them is the practice of administrative guidance, or administrative guidance of business activity by
the State (2009, p. 41). Meredith Woo's study in Chang's (2007) work addresses this practice with
greater attention, focusing on the cases of Japan and South Korea. Administrative guidance is
defined there as a state practice whereby “economic policy is formatted and implemented by
mechanisms informal bodies, consciously insulated from the interference of the formal legal
system.” (Woo, 2007, p. 162) As a result, there is “wide discretion for the bureaucracy to make,
interpret and apply detailed rules of economic behavior.” (2007, p. 164) Woo argues, in particular,
that the use of administrative guidance was even more important for the development of South Korea
than in the case of Japan, as it was not just used to give “pushes” (to nudge) in the economy, but
also to reform it through “the industrial reorganization of 1998, which proposed finding the
comparative industrial advantage of each conglomerate and then requiring firms to stick to it. The
ultimate goal was to reduce overinvestment by reducing the number of firms in the same industrial
sector, forcing firms to focus on their 'core competence' after years of excessive and redundant
diversification.” (2007, p. 168) In other words, state orientation organized competition between
Korean industrial conglomerates, allowing them to safely specialize and acquire scale gains in production, which favored their strategic positioning as companies globally.

the advanced economies of the modern West have experienced periods of
aggressive industrialization and economic growth with a wide range of
different ownership regimes in operation. Property regimes differ, sometimes
dramatically, across industrialized societies, and all these societies harbor a
variety of different formal and informal regimes.

Some systems opt for litigation between opposing claimants, each claiming
to have an exclusive right [...]. Contrast this with systems that openly
discourage formal dispute resolution mechanisms and instead encourage or
constrain opposing claimants to use less formal channels of bargaining and
coordination. (Milhaupt; Pistor, 2008, p. 181)243

Economic growth has often depended on the erosion or elimination of
traditional entitlements, as well as generating new rights and new forms of
ownership. [...] Using property as an instrument for development strategy
requires choosing – between varied economic interests and between modes
of entitlement. The strategic instrument may well be the relative strength or
clarity of one, rather than another, legal interest. In any property regime, some
entitlements will be weak and vague, others will be strong or clear. The
strategic configuration of a property regime requires careful consideration of
the economic impact of making some rights strong or some entitlements clear
over others. (Kennedy, 2011, p. 6)

David Kennedy complements this point by stating: “Economic activity, in this view, takes place
outside state power and thrives best when left alone. Today, it might seem that modernization and
growth in the less developed regions of the world require that this economic domain be freed from
developmental state control just as it was once freed from feudalism and mercantilism. [...] It is not
uncommon to associate strong and clear property rights with a strongly restrained State and
concomitantly with a robust private market, capable of functioning as an engine of growth and guarantor of efficiency.”

“Several legal tools are used in this context: price control, subsidies, tariffs, quotas, lines of credit,
public tenders and purchases, tax incentives and waivers, monopolies and public banks. The fields of

put in place an industrial development project led by a State that knows adequate means to achieve
legitimate ends, including increasing the population's income. .”
(Coutinho, 2013, p. 87)

“To this ideal typical model of the State, dedicated to a national policy of economic development
that is still dissociated from the social dimension, corresponds to a type of legal framework that has
the primary task of institutionalizing and operationalizing the modernizing and industrializing impulse.
Law enables the structuring of a technocracy focused on the administration of the public apparatus,
including the management of bodies, companies and institutional interfaces, as well as sectoral
regulation, which leads to an abundant normative production. Legal rules are used both to structure
the State itself and to stimulate specific sectors such as steel, civil construction, mining, petrochemicals,
gas and oil, for example. Ultimately, the law is used to create non-existent markets, stimulating flows
and transactions that otherwise would not exist.” (Coutinho, 2013, p. 87)

the formulations of Walt Rostow (1964 [1960]), in Stages of economic development. According to
this author, it would be “possible to classify all societies, in their economic dimensions, within one
of the following five categories: traditional society; the preconditions for the take-off, the take-off,
the march to maturity and the era of mass consumption.” (Rostow, 1964, p. 14)

“In terms of legal tools, Moment 2 corresponds, synthetically, to the use of the apparatus
to 'liberalize' markets. A state intervention considered intrusive is rejected through the introduction
of incentives for competition and rivalry between economic agents, the deregulation of sectors
hitherto subordinated to norms that provided for technical and technological standards, performance
targets, as well as controlling entry and exit of agents in the markets.” (Coutinho, 2013, p. 88)
The reforms in public law corresponding to this second moment sought to contain the role of the
State in the economy. “Economic and administrative law in several countries is used to, through
privatization processes, remove the State from the economy, sell public assets, giving the Public
Power the role of regulator in a game in which the players are private actors. The clear definition and
secure enforcement of property rights and the function of reducing transaction costs in favor of the
fluidity of market exchanges summarize the essential functions of an efficient legal order.” (Coutinho, 2013, p. 88)

renationalize state-owned companies that had been privatized, impose price
controls, create a top-down development plan, discourage foreign
investment, declare a moratorium on its international obligations, carry out
deficit spending, or closed its markets to foreign industries. Efforts focused
on building new forms of industrial policy that emphasized innovation and
partnership with industry. At the same time, it has placed substantial
emphasis on social policies and redistribution and has aimed to combine
its social policy and industrial growth strategies. (Trubek; Coutinho;

(Trubek, 2013, p. 12), given the preservation of previous policies such as inflation control, openness
to foreign investment and macroeconomic policy in general (Trubek; Coutinho; Schapiro, 2012, p. 8).
The recovery occurred in 2004, with the Industrial, Technological and Foreign Trade Policy (PITCE),
which focused on financial support and the promotion of innovation in four sectors: semiconductors,
software, capital goods and medicines. Part of PITCE’s strategy was to “facilitate partnerships and
synergy between universities, companies and research institutes” as well as to provide “government
support for university research.” (Trubek; Coutinho; Schapiro, 2012, p. 9, cf. Schapiro; Trubek, 2012,
p. 48) In 2008, the Productive Development Policy (PDP) replaced PITCE as a “much more ambitious
and complex” industrial policy and which “placed special emphasis on collaboration between the
public and private sectors” in a more varied range of industries (Trubek; Coutinho; Schapiro, 2012,
p. 9-10; cf. Schapiro; Trubek, 2012, p. 50). This lineage of industrial policy based on public-private
coordination continued with the “Brasil Maior” program, started in 2011, and which identified 20
priority sectors for economic development (Trubek; Coutinho; Schapiro, 2012, p. 11).

The new state activism in Brazil corresponds to the resumption of industrial policy instruments
in the 21st century, which had been abandoned in the 1990s in favor of market-centered approaches.

role played by law went beyond the function of merely guaranteeing the

constitute a long-term financing system, for which it was necessary to establish
a regime of state ownership in the banking sector, thus supplying the need for
private investors. Since then, the Brazilian financing model has been based on

In the Brazilian scenario, the trajectory of the BNDES, in addition to
challenging the expectations of economic reforms conducted along the
lines of the Rule of Law, has also been a significant example of what an
institutional reprogramming exercise can be. Although the Bank was
constituted as a support agent for developmental programs, adapted to the
State-centered pattern of development and import substitution strategies,
its intervention has been redesigned in the last twenty years. From an actor

reinvention (cf. Castro, 2012). For a specific application of this critique to Brazilian constitutional
law, see Globalization, democracy and constitutional law: legacies received and possibilities for
change (Castro, 2014b). These texts harbor criticisms of conventional ways of conceiving and
working the law, in relation to which the AJPE presents itself as an alternative.

The AJPE presupposes that institutions and policies should serve orders
compatible with the equal enjoyment of human and fundamental rights and
that individuals and groups should not be enslaved to institutions whose
structure opposes obstacles to such enjoyment. Being fully conventional, it
is the institutions (public policies, economic policies, international
cooperation mechanisms) that must be changed to adapt to the exercise of
the enjoyment of human and fundamental rights, not the opposite. (Castro, 2009, p. 46)

In this sense, for Marcus Faro de Castro, economic justice implies “reconciling the functionality
and productivity of the economy, on the one hand, and, on the other, the equal protection of the
fundamental rights of individuals and groups” (Castro, 2009, p. 21) .

legal institutions of “unavailability reserve ” (cf. 2010, p. 161), as in the cases of family property and
limitations on attachment that affect some properties and wages. As an example of this distinction,
a “package of rice on the shelf of a supermarket or in the pantry of a restaurant” is treated as
commercial property, while the same package, in the cupboard of a domestic kitchen, represents civil property (2009, p 50).
Finally, in the case of hybrid property, “productive consumption practices are very close to those of
final consumption”, as occurs with home or “backyard” industries, small family farming properties

Indexes occupy a central position in the Positional Analysis procedure. This way of providing
legal arguments with numerical expression reflects the recognition, by AJPE, that the articulation of
knowledge in the form of mathematical indicators is of great relevance for guiding the behavior of
different actors, including public authorities and private agents. Globally, a variety of indicators
(including those from private sources, see section 2.3) have been used as guides for the development
of public policies and also as tools for their evaluation, in the most varied areas and themes. The
normative implications of indicators are already recognized in recent legal literature, such as the
work Governance by indicators: global power through quantification and rankings, by Davis et al
(2012). In addition to its normative implications, another relevant aspect of using indicators or
argumentation in statistical form is its use for social criticism. As Alain Desrosières points out,
indices have historically been used to make visible – and bring to the agenda of public discussions
about – economic and social phenomena that previously remained hidden, through the measurement,
for example, of unemployment, poverty and the creation of indices of income inequality, among others (cf. Desrosières, 2014).

The view of the economy as being organized in contracts is close to the writings of Ronald Coase
in The nature of the firm (1937), in which institutions such as “firms” are seen as “connections of
contracts”. See section 4.1.
