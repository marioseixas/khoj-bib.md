Quantification and Objectivity. From Statistical
Conventions to Social Conventions

Robert Salais∗

Abstract: »Quantifizierung und Objektivität. Von statistischen Konventionen zu
sozialen Konventionen«. Standard quantification processes and most often their
analysis are derived from statistics’ technique and approach. Social conventions
are at the core of daily life, practical knowledge and coordination between people;
statistical conventions are at the heart of cognitive activities developed by
statisticians. What does quantification mean when addressed from the wider
point of view of social conventions? This article analyzes the differences between
social and statistical conventions. It enlarges the concept of objectivity in having
recourse to the lenses of the plurality of worlds as defined by the economics of
convention (EC), and to the concept of the informational basis of judgement in
justice introduced by Amartya Sen. A wider conception of quantification processes
in the social world can thus be elaborated, which opens fresh views on what
become, in these processes, the concepts of facts and democracy.
Keywords: Quantification, conventions, statistics, worlds, plurality, informational
basis, judgment in justice, facts, democracy.

1. Introduction

In his article in Historical Social Research 37 (1), Alain Desrosières (2011) has
shown how deeply the economics of convention (in short EC) is historically
rooted in research on the history of statistical conventions and categories. Are
statistical conventions of measurement nonetheless of the same nature as the
social conventions people have recourse to coordinate in daily situations of life
and work? Or do they delineate two separate universes that intersect only fortuitously?
Such questions are all the more important as standard quantification
processes, and most often their analysis, are both derived from statistics’ technique
and approach. Social conventions are at the core of daily life, practical
knowledge and coordination between people; statistical conventions are at the
heart of cognitive activities developed by statisticians. Hence, what does quantification
mean when addressed from the wider point of view of social conventions?∗

In this article, I try to develop that wider view on quantification processes in
taking inspiration from the EC. In Section 2, I review the status of objectivity
in a few of the canonical works of sociology of quantification. In Section 3, I
more in-depth analyze the differences between social and statistical conventions.
Then, in Section 4, I enlarge the concept of objectivity in having recourse
to the lenses of the plurality of worlds as defined by the EC, and to the concept
of the informational basis of judgement in justice introduced by Amartya Sen.
In Section 5, I list the main characteristics of quantification processes on which
to look from such a combined point of view, mixing the economics of convention
and Sen’s developments.
So let me begin by briefly presenting the two universes of social versus statistical
conventions. I will come back to them in Section 3. Social conventions
allow us to coordinate with others, to form mutual expectations, to understand
each other without even having to think about it beforehand, and explain to
others the purport of what we are going to do, without ex ante negotiating a
contract, without external rules embedded into institutions and dictating our
behavior. Systems of conventions shared by people create worlds in which
people mutually consider they live and act together. These worlds are not “real”
in the positivist sense. They are real in the sense that coordinating people
give the elements of these worlds compatible meanings and verify the likelihood
of these meanings by the fact they successfully achieve their undertakings
and projects. There is a plurality of such worlds of variable scope based on
different principles. As social beings in our daily life, we are moving from one
world to another, depending of the activity, the people, the situation at stake.
They are not at all immutable worlds forever. They arise and re-arise again in
situations by being generated via mutual expectations and coordination between
people. They are for people more or less implicit or reflexively explicit
depending of events and hazards. Though they are not – properly speaking –
substantial, these worlds left interpretable traces, either material, cognitive, or
symbolic in the situations. To what extent can all these very diverse common
worlds we just spoke about be relevantly subject to standard quantification
processes, applying statistical techniques?
To have a preliminary view of what statistical conventions are, open any
publication by a statistician. You will always find, at the beginning or in a byside
insert, a series of methodological precautions. These tell the reader the
detailed procedures and categories that have been employed, what they allow to
say and not to say when interpreting them. The fact that the right procedures
are followed serves as proof that data is correct. Publishing the methodology is
supposed to guarantee the reproducibility: anybody who would try to reproduce
the methodology would arrive at the same outcome. Doing so, statisticians are
applying the procedural objectivity as employed in scientific research. Is this
type of objectivity valuable for quantifying processes of social life? Do “ordinary”
people have recourse on this type of objectivity when deploying social
HSR 41 (2016) 2 │ 120

conventions? Or do they put into action other objectivities? These are the issues
I will first consider.

2. Scientific Objectivity and Social Conventions

Approaches of quantification processes have begun in the Anglo-Saxon world
in the more general field of sociology of sciences. The Anglo-Saxon world, its
social actors, and researchers, are characterized by its focusing on a specific
conception of objectivity, that of scientific objectivity as first developed in
Britain by the very influential scientist Francis Bacon.
I have immersed myself in a series of articles on objectivity that I had collected,
promising myself to read them one day. These articles come from special
issues from Annals of Scholarship published in 1992 that included work by
noted researchers in the field of sociology of quantification, such as Lorraine
Daston, Theodore Porter, and Peter Miller.1
 I find that the predominant notions
and practices in the Anglo-Saxon world can be summarized by their strong
historical reliance on a specific concept of “facts.” Any knowledge is not
“fact.” To become fact, knowledge should be detached both from the context of
observation in which facts were generated and from contemporary theoretical
controversies (that are relegated to the rank of ideologies). If so, such facts
could be said as objective, which means that such facts become entirely selfsufficient
as incontrovertible truths. They owe nothing to the turbulence of
ideological debates or the specificities of the field of observation. So they must
prevail in the discussion.

2.1 From Baconian Objectivity to Modern “Evidence”

The above posture, very influential over time, is that adopted by Francis Bacon in
the 17th century, in opposition to Aristotle and the scholastics. Lorraine Daston
has followed the posterity of this position through the debates it raised over time
within the scientific community (Daston 1992). It is worth briefly recalling in
what system of beliefs Bacon has embedded his conception of objectivity.
Frank and Fritzie Manuel (1976) remind us that, among many writings, Bacon
was the author of a utopia, The New Atlantis (Bacon 1951). The major
institution of Atlantis was a college of 36 scientists-priests called the Elders.
Their mission – an action program obeying to a very centralized organization –
was to monitor in Atlantis the development of science toward innovation and
the accumulation of scientific knowledge. This so-called Solomon’s House was
independent both from the state and from the people. Elders decided what
inventions and experiments should be made public and which should not, and

1
 See Allan Megill, ed. (1992, 1994).
HSR 41 (2016) 2 │ 121

also when to impart secret inventions to the state. “The end of our foundation is
the knowledge of the causes, and secret motion of things; and the enlarging of
the human Empire, to the effecting of all possible things” (Bacon 1951, 288).
The methodology was based on the repetition of the same experiments under
different conditions (what are called today experimental designs). Outcomes
were discussed by the college and new experiments decided. Some Elders,
called the “Interpreters,” were in charge to “distill from all the experiments
general observations and axioms” (Manuel and Manuel 1979, 258). One recognizes
the experimental, science-based objectivity of the concept of “facts” as
above defined.
The other dimension of the objectivity of “facts,” independence from ideology,
has been today amputated from its Baconian religious connotation. Bacon
was concerned not to sully science by human emotions and, above all, that
scientists “do not presume by the contemplation of nature to attain to the mysteries
of God” (Bacon 1951, 6). Indeed, the scientist had a religious duty to
inquire into God’s creation and to force nature to yield up in works all the
potentialities inherent in creation (in other terms all that had ever been there,
waiting for its discovery). But the objective of science for Bacon was accumulation
of knowledge through the contemplation of nature, not accumulation of
capital through the exploitation of nature. This (fragile) preservation of nature
proceeds for Bacon from its God creation.
In the long run, this concept of “fact” has been refurbished without losing its
key foundations. Today, minus religion-based ethics, plus quantitative efficiency
(the search of what works),2
 the same ideal of objectivity is called “evidence.”
Evidence remains something on which everybody should agree without
discussion whatever his political, social, or theoretical position, and that can be
extracted without cognitive damage from the singularities of the empirical
observation. Evidence is not pre-given; it should be built through procedures
that possess the property of objectivity.
In matters of scientific knowledge, the possibility of relying on this type of
objectivity is dependent on the experimental protocol that must be as rigorous,
verifiable, and reproducible by a third party as is possible. As emphasized by
Allan Megill in his introduction, the underlying objectivity is procedural (Megill
1992). As long as the procedure is followed, the result obtained belongs to
a sphere that is neither that which is true or just, but the unfalsifiable. It will
remain valid until another researcher posits another theory and shows, using a
methodology of the same nature, that in fact there should have been a different
understanding of the same reality, that there are other properties and forces at
work. And even then, the figures will be established along similar types of
procedures.

2
 Search of what works is now the matter of a myriad of books in the Anglo-Saxon literature,
both scientific and popular.
HSR 41 (2016) 2 │ 122

In such a methodological posture, quantification is sought, not merely for the
additional information it provides, but mostly to bring the incontrovertible procedural
proof that one is right. Could what is valid in scientific matters be transferred
as such to social life (not to speak of the controversies on such issue in
hard sciences also)? If so, “facts,” even those related to human and social affairs,
should thus be abstracted from the social conventions of their time and population.
This pretention is highly contestable, as we will see below.

2.2 The Use of Evidence in Quantification in Bureaucratic and
Managerial Circles
Observing Anglo-Saxon bureaucratic and managerial circles, Theodore Porter
(1992) and Peter Miller (1992) conclude that, in these circles, the force of
quantification lies in its reliance on the objectivity of figures and the intangibility
of the bureaucratic and managerial rules that underlie their constitution. The
objectivity of figures is based on arithmetic, and therefore cannot be contested:
4 is larger than 3; a drop from 100 to 80 is a 20% reduction. The intangibility
of the rules is due to the fact that they are rationally grounded and have been
rigorously established to achieve a certain sort of optimum balance, both social
and economic.3
Procedural objectivity has another property, “politically” interesting to
transport into the social domain. It is impartial. The subject of this type of
quantification cannot complain of partiality, and conversely can argue that s/he
has not profited from any special treatment. Neither injustice nor favoritism,
this type of quantification instruments a particular conception of justice, the
justice based on objective equality of treatment. These two authors suggest the
ways in which – in this social context of objectivity – figures can be appropriately
manipulated and have the power to transform practices, behavior, and
thinking. As Miller puts it, the proponents of corporate accounting (in this case
analytical accounting) are driven by the utopian desire to “form” a new man, in
the strongest sense, of giving shape and – almost – life. Such a new man would
think and act according to the dictates of performance prescribed by accounting.
He could not imagine any other way of being. For he has been convinced
that the world created for him is efficient (privileging performance) and just
(treating individuals equally). This world espouses values that this individual
recognizes: talent, merit, and responsibility.
Procedural objectivity of that type is based on standardization, on the belief
that, whatever the complexity, diversity, and singularities of circumstances, it is
always possible to put somebody in a given case of a statistical table at the
crossing of some general nomenclatures without losing any relevant piece of
information.

3
 This conception of “rule” can be found in John Rawls (1955).

2.3 The Impossible Transposition in Social Life

However, things are not so simple, for the transposition in social life of procedural
objectivity is precisely a utopia. It does not work for every case or all
circumstances. When is it relevant and when is it not are questions that cannot
be eliminated without the risk of social or cognitive damage. To take this example,
the film “Welfare” by Frederick Wiseman, devoted to a welfare office
in the United States, illustrates the conflict, very painful for both parties, that
arises when a request for aid that would be justified in terms of social justice
based on the welfare of persons does not fit into the framework defined by the
system of rules. The employee is caught between the desire to do the right
thing, and the impossibility of satisfying the demand. And the applicant cannot
achieve a just resolution of his case.
Does such a situation, apparently unsolvable, mean the impossibility to
overcome the conflict or does it simply signal that there could exist other ways to
define the problem, other worlds of quantification, and types of objectivity than
those based on standardized impartiality? In such a situation, debating and convincing
other participants that one is right is inconceivable for individuals because
their claims are facing a complex, standardized, and powerful machinery, a
multilevel system of rules which produce the data and the final yes or no judgment.
Are there nevertheless worlds, in the sense recalled in the introduction, in
which social justice could be achieved in being founded on other principles?
The way to overcome the blockade and to understand what is at work is to decode
the entire chain that has produced the data. Only professionals of statistics
have the capability to do so, if not the will. If it is done – and Alain Desrosières
and Laurent Thévenot were pioneers of such an undertaking (Desrosières 2008;
Thévenot 1984) –, it would publicly appear a series of rules of classification and
measurement that, taken one by one, are in no way scientific axioms. They are
socially determined in the sense that other choices would have been possible
that would have led to another frame and judgment. In the illustrations from
Wiseman, it could have appeared for instance that both the applicant and the
employee had another principle of justice in mind, hence other ways of classifying
and quantifying that would have achieved an agreement. One of the reasons
could be that they know by their experience of life that, in this instance,
using a minimum income threshold to decide whether to help or not was not
relevant. For the specific case, the right issue was to provide the claimant with
a decent housing that he cannot obtain on the market. The market was functioning
on the basis of conventions, i.e. mutual expectations, like exhibiting individual
responsibility, having a secure job, inspiring trust, etc. But, as these
conventions are not taken on board by the rules of the welfare system, no adequate
solution could be found.

3. When and Where Could Statistical and Social
Conventions Meet?

We will pass here in review the specificities of statistical versus social conventions,
and then consider how they could meet. The main difference between
statistical and social conventions is basically that the former are rules, not
conventions; only the latter can be labelled as conventions.

3.1 Statistical Conventions

Statistical conventions are not conventions in the sense of expectations mutually
agreed among people, but rules. These rules have been pondered at length in
keeping with forms borrowed from science, and aim for objectivity and incontrovertibility.
They create standard categories (which then allow general statements
detached from elementary observation) by treating as equivalent all
people, or answers to questionnaires that possess the same general property. As
they are built for the long run, they have also their own temporalities that do
not correspond to social temporalities.
Statistical conventions are built with reference to a founding scene: the configuration
as defined by Norbert Elias (1973) in which the person is subject to
questioning and is called upon to answer. These conventions are meant to construct
and equip this scene adequately to reach the expected ends. We can
speak of injunction because the person who is questioned faces (just like in a
company) a vast institutional system embedded in the mechanisms, rules, and
components of the scene, and hence enters a power relationship. This is clear in
administrative statistics, for example the production of data that goes along
with the daily operation of the welfare office, but is also more subtly present
for the person being questioned for a population census or a survey.
Likewise, the general categories that underlie equivalence, according to
Alain Desrosières (Desrosières 1998) (or commensurability, in the words of
Wendy Espeland; see Espeland and Stevens 1998), and the observation methods
deployed to implement them are elaborated, criticized, and revised in the
professional spheres of statistics, accounting, or law. In these spheres, the discussion
about which rules to choose and the choices to be made cannot totally
escape from some observation on what is going on in society and the conventions
at work. But the aim is that – once established – these rules can go their
own way. So, the dynamic relationship between statistical and social conventions
in a given society is complex and even unpredictable. Both systems borrow
to each other, but at the same time they differ and sometimes even can take
distance from each other.
HSR 41 (2016) 2 │ 125

3.2 Social Conventions

Social conventions also partake of cognition. That cognition, however, is the
one of ordinary people, focusing on common situations, not of professionals of
cognition. It arises not in a statistical scene centered on responding, but in daily
life where action must be coordinated with others. At the difference of scientific
or rational cognition which aims at producing explicit formal knowledge,
the finalities of “daily” cognition are practical, even better, pragmatic. It is
consequently centered on acting, precisely on the relevant acting that will produce
the expected outcomes for people.
For EC, it follows from these characteristics that ordinary action always has
three interrelated moments: a cognitive moment, a normative moment and a
pragmatic one.
These moments, most of the time, are never considered as such either in statistics
or in quantification processes. These moments are, however, essential to
understand. In practice, they emerge in the instant and locus of the action (in
other terms in the situation) and are indexed to these instant and locus. They
are also dynamically articulated. The cognitive moment brings forth what “suffices”
to know in the pragmatic moment (whose aim is the successful completion
of the coordination). What to pragmatically know in the situation is linked
to the normative moment. Conventions are also practical norms other people
expect you will refer to in your action. So, they are not purely pragmatic in the
usual sense, but they convey a notion of justice. It follows, for the EC, that the
normative moment mobilizes individual conceptions about the fair treatment
people expect from others during the coordination. Expectations on fair treatment
allow people to select in their environment the relevant information, to
interpret the behaviors and intentions of other people, and to guide his own
action. The coupling of the three moments leads to success or to failure of the
engaged coordination.

3.3 When and Where Could Statistical and Social Conventions
Converge?
We have already noticed that the establishment of statistical conventions needs
to be somewhat connected to social reality. If not, if they are too far away from
daily understandings of that reality by people; the data processed from people’s
answers would produce an information, mostly irrelevant for political purposes.
In case of unemployment for instance, at least in France at the turn of the 20th
century, women at work in homework (5 or 6 million), or peasants having at
the same time an industrial job did not understand a situation of no work as
unemployment in the modern sense (Salais, Baverez and Reynaud 1999). This
situation was understood as part of normal life. Homework, for instance, had its
off seasons with no orders. So, when questioned in a census, homeworkers did
not produce answers leading to be classified as unemployed.
HSR 41 (2016) 2 │ 126

But it also can work in the other way. The diffusion in public policies of
general categories may in the long run induce a shifting of “indigenous” understandings
of social situation and lead not to identity, but to convergence towards
statistical conceptions. It depends of other economic, social, or political transformations.
In France, again for unemployment, from the 1970s onwards, women
looking for a job began to register at public employment offices. In so doing, they
adhered in practice to the official statistical definition of unemployment and were
included in official statistics. It led to an increase of the number of unemployed
people that was somewhat artificial because it was not linked to any fall of the
level of employment.
Such reciprocal moves are unpredictable. It could or could not occur. As
Bénédicte Zimmermann (2001, 2006) demonstrates, the move toward a general
and generally admitted category of unemployment proved impossible in Germany.
The plurality of social worlds (see the next section) was so resilient that
still today several regimes of employment, hence several understanding of what
means to be unemployed cohabitate in Germany.

4. Worlds and their Informational Bases of Judgment in
Justice

The problems with the articles on quantification mentioned above are, firstly,
their tendency to limit the person to the rational individual, and secondly, the
failure to take plurality into due consideration. They rightly described the conceptions
of quantification in Anglo-American administrations and enterprises,
but cannot ground any relevant critics. These limitations must be surpassed in
order for research to fully grasp social processes of quantification. That is what
EC can take on board by focusing on social conventions.
As individuals are social beings embedded into networks of affiliations and
activities, they are able to differentiate different worlds in the meaning we
provided in the introduction and to which we will come below. They are able to
think and act within them by practicing the system of conventions relevant in
the world in which – in the situation under progress – they consider to be.
Hence, they have the capability to take distance from and to be critical against
quantification processes they believe inadequate to their conception of the
evaluated domain of activity or to their values. Any scientific approach of
quantification processes should fully integrate these facts. It is no more possible
to view the diversity of practices by the unique lens of objectivity as evidence,
impartial objective justice and standardization of data. One should be
open to other elaborations that obey to the above principles.
To succeed requires working at the crossing of two fields of research, that of
the plurality of worlds already labored by EC and that of the informational
bases of judgement on justice (IBJJ) as developed by Amartya Sen in his capa-
HSR 41 (2016) 2 │ 127

bility approach. We first remind the plurality of worlds as conceived by EC,
and then, make the bridge with the Sen’s IBJJ.4

4.1 The Plurality of Worlds and their Conception of Objectivity
and Justice
The “plurality of worlds” hypothesis and its empirical description are running
all along EC’s research process, especially in Eymard-Duvernay (1989),
Boltanski and Thévenot (1991), and Salais and Storper (1993, 1997).5
 Through
various elaborations, all these works converge towards the same basic axioms
and outcomes.
As stated in the introduction, systems of conventions give access to a plurality
of worlds. In Salais and Storper (1997) we distinguished four of these
worlds: the industrial world, the interpersonal world, the market world, and the
intellectual world – plus combinations between them. Let us here only focus of
their conception of objectivity and justice.6
The industrial world is congruent with objectivity as evidence, for its organization
and functioning are based on systematic standardization of products, of
industrial processes, of work and individual identification, of measurement, of
performance reduced to quantitative variables. The industrial world takes the
evidence exhibited by numbers as a general principle to direct evaluation. No
aspect of the reality at stake can escape to such processes of rising into generality.
No singularity is capable of resisting such generalization and equivalence
or to serve to support for criticism. In the industrial world, the particular is
expressed only as an example, an application of the general model. It does not
signal the presence of another world in the situation, though this might appear
beneath the surface during the coding of elementary operations (Thévenot
1983). This is the price to pay in order to establish the impersonal impartiality
of a quantitative observation of the situation, which is the sole conception of
justice making social and economic coordination possible in that world. But
there are other worlds, such as the interpersonal world and the market world. In
the interpersonal world, coordination is based upon durable personal relationships.
People have an in-depth knowledge of the others coming from familiarity
acquired through proximities. To coordinate in a given situation does not
have to rely on quantification. It mostly requires spontaneous forms of understanding
of the situation based on familiarity and experience. In the market
world, quantification is of interest only because it reveals the degree of competition
between individuals and, more generally, between participants in the
market. It helps to make ratings and scorings along price and cost comparisons,

to discover the best offer or the best demand, to build anticipations on the futures.
Basically, the ideal-type of quantification for all markets in the market
world is made of the series of indicators that enable stock markets to make
conjectures about the shares of all sorts that are bought and sold.
More generally, in the compromises that prevail between these worlds and
the industrial world, quantification can be useful at certain levels of aggregation,
but not at more “local” levels. And the question of what not to quantify
becomes a key issue for achieving such compromises. There is no need to
quantify everything; as Sen said, “description is choice” (Sen 1980). In other
terms: quantifying is at the same time submitting people to evaluation, hence to
control, and trying to guide their actions. Not to quantify implies to decide,
whatever the way to do so, what type and scope of freedom, and into what
domain have to be left to people, especially as markers of trust.

4.2 Sen and the Informational Basis for Judgment in Justice

So, we must look beyond the sociology of science-based quantification to elaborate
the theoretical foundations of the plurality of modes of quantification,
based on the plurality of worlds, and thereby the plurality of social forms of
knowledge. Amartya Sen’s works on capability and the informational basis of
judgement in justice (IBJJ) are offering the basis for a wider and more relevant
theoretical framework on which to build. Sen – in an entirely different intellectual
domain: the theories of justice – broaches the dimension of justice in its
double dimension of “correctness” and of “fairness.” The originality of Sen,
compared to Arrow or Rawls, is his insistence on the informational basis of
judgement in justice, which, in a democracy, defines the content and mechanisms
of collective choice. In his theoretical treatment of collective choices,
Sen maintains the need for objective evaluation of the individuals and their
social positions, as opposed to the dominant procedural current of ordinal ranking.
The knowledge of social reality, of its substance, should be the object of a
collective building of knowledge, not only the ranking between situations or
individuals.
Such introduction of fairness issues radically transforms theoretical and
practical approaches to quantification in the social world. Firstly, it renders
explicit the normative dimension of any quantification process, which legitimates
the need of public discussion and democratic deliberation on choices initially
considered as purely technical and to be left to technicians and experts. Secondly,
it enriches the concept of “facts,” making factuality and knowledge a collective
elaboration where all stakeholders interested in the domain under review have to
participate. Suddenly, John Dewey and his concerns about inquiry, the constitutions
of publics, and people’s participation become parts of the fields of research
and of collective action. Far from to be isolated against social conventions and
HSR 41 (2016) 2 │ 129

against the singularity of situations, facts, to be rightly and correctly elaborated,
require taking into account social conventions and singularities.
Sen introduces, in effect, a fascinating concept for research on and practices
of quantification, that of factual territory. Let us first quote Sen:
The informational basis of a judgment identifies the information on which the
judgment is directly dependent and – no less important – asserts that the truth
or falsehood of any other type of information cannot directly influence the
correctness of the judgment. The informational basis of judgments of justice
thus determines the factual territory over which considerations of justice
would directly apply (Sen 1990, 111).7
A factual territory for a given issue at whatever level is composed of all the
information which is, no more no less, necessary and sufficient to achieve the
two criteria of correctness and fairness for the decision to build and the choice
to make. For the same situation, depending of the world to which people consider
belonging (or of the compromises between), several factual territories can
be built for the same issue and a choice so offered to the democratic debate.
The last – but not least – advantage to the concept of IBJJ is that the relevant
information is not limited to quantities. This helps to have a wider look at
quantification processes, notably at the selection of facts to be quantified and
how, of those which are not. It helps to be aware of the normativity embedded
into technical choices and to reveal it.
Without harking back to the canons of Arrow or Rawls, let us say that in
theories of justice, the problem of democratic choice is to achieve an optimal
outcome, according to two criteria to fulfil:
1) All individuals feel that they occupy the right place and have their claims
taken into account, because they find the necessary resources and, according
to Sen, the capabilities to conduct the life that they value.
2) This optimal outcome is attained through democratic deliberation between
individuals in which each and all have been able to participate, express their
claims and have them heard by others. Collective agreement is possibly only
under these twin conditions. So, it is a matter of collectively reaching a state
of common knowledge that is just, i.e. both correct and fair.

5. Implications for Research on Quantification Processes

Of course, few effective processes of quantification obey the whole guidelines
leading to an IBJJ. But starting from this theoretical framework helps to discover,
for a given process, which it takes on board and which is missing. So
doing, one can found both: a relevant critique and a search for alternatives. To

made by us.

conclude, we will focus on three issues that make the difference for the analysis
of quantification between the standard evidence approach and the approach of
EC: facts, objectivity, and democracy.

5.1 Which Facts?

Coming back to our discussion in Section 2, one should emphasize that the
facts so engendered – their “factuality,” if one could say – are not at all the
evidence, so praised in Anglo-Saxon methodologies. The difference concerns
several points:
- there are collective judgments on the situation at stake, its issues, and participants,
not positivist or what-works statements reflecting some pre-existing
reality, purged from its conventional elements;
- these judgments constitute cognitive representations in which normative
concerns are embedded into the choice of cognitive categories and inquiry
methods;
- there is a plurality of possible relevant judgments for the same situation and
issue, depending on the agreement between participants on the relevant
world (or compromise between worlds).

5.2 Which Objectivity?

The status of objectivity is not, and cannot be, the same for statistical and social
conventions. The difference comes from the treatment of social justice. At best,
as we have seen, statistical objectivity can support an instrumental conception
of justice, equal treatment of quantifying between people, and impersonality.
But it has not been explicitly searched for.
Expectations of fair treatment by people in their daily life and work are far
from being restrained to equal treatment of quantifying. For instance, in a
world built around personal and durable relations (one can find in neighborhood,
in family, in small firms, or personal networks), people expect more than
only impersonal treatment. As they know that others have a true knowledge of
them, they expect (mutually) to be treated at their value. Not a standard number,
but a value whose expression is, for the essential, qualitative, unique, and
even singular as it is closely linked to the situation and to the persons present in
it. In the market world, people expect as fair treatment to buy and exchange
goods that satisfy their individual utility, hence the key role they attribute to the
signals sent by the participants to the market and to their correctness. Only in the
industrial world built on systematic standardization in all domains could people
be ready to accept their instrumental reduction to numbers (though not so easily
because there are here and there always traces of other worlds in any coordination
built along industrial world’s principles, for instance in wage determination,
or in tacit expectations from managers that workers compensate by their
initiatives the failures and hazards that occur in any rational organization).

So if one endorses the theoretical approach of EC, objectivity should be understood
as “conventional,” that is an objectivity which is not only correct in
terms of scientific procedures, but is by the same way based on common expectations
between the participants with regard to the right principle of justice (or
the compromise) to refer to. The plurality of objectivities has to be acknowledged,
each of one being viewed as socially valid, and of equal theoretical and
practical value. Objectivity should be considered, above all, as a social construct
at the crossing of correctness (in its usual scientific acceptation) and
fairness (applying a principle of justice recognized as legitimate in the community
at stake).

5.3 Which Democracy?

In an EC approach, enriched with Sen’s IBJJ, the theoretical and empirical grid to
analyze quantification processes should start from the following assumptions:
- As a social construct, any objective judgment evaluating situations or people
should be produced, neither from outside, nor from rules chosen by some authority
or power considering it has some natural a priori legitimacy to do so.
- Choice has to be “democratic,” with the participation of the evaluated.
- Even so, these assumptions can be transcribed in several ways, depending of
the way the leading authority conceives its action and coordination with the
evaluated and find an agreement with them.
Following these guidelines to build observations helps to have access to segments
of reality that are most the time inaccessible to standard approaches. One
will only develop the last point about the diverse conceptions of authority, for it
largely remains terra incognita. We had our attention attracted to this issue
thanks to our approach to the state, developed with Michael Storper (Salais and
Storper 1993, 326-46). Looking at the diversity of states’ conceptions in Europe
and in process of the invention of the European Union, it is easy to discover
traces of different historically-rooted conceptions of central authority and
its relationship with democratic practices (Salais 2015). There are parallels and
homologies to establish at a higher level with the worlds we presented in this
contribution, especially the industrial world, the interpersonal world and the
market world.
Remember that a world in our sense is not real in the standard meaning, but
is a pragmatic world that holds on by the belief, shared by the participants, that
they belong to that world. So doing, people develop mutual expectations that
allow them to successfully coordinate. The same could be said of the relationship
between a central authority and the people under it. Such a relation holds
and leads to expected outcomes, only and only if both sides share the belief
they belong to the same world. If not, quantification processes are characterized
by a lack of consistency, which leads to rational manipulation, cheats, and
other similar manifestations from both sides. Using a grid based on types of
HSR 41 (2016) 2 │ 132

authority and of legitimacy so conceived again helps to shed lights on such
phenomena and to decrypt discourses and attitudes.
What are the key issues for defining such types of authority and legitimacy?
is a largely open question. In Salais (2015), with regards to the state, I oppose
two global conceptions of the relationship expected by both sides.
1) In the first conception, each side agrees to devolve to the central authority
the whole task of building the quantification process (modalities, what and
how to measure). Evaluated people, through their representatives, are asked
to indicate if they agree the choices made by the central authority. The applied
procedure is similar to the one which is used in standard representative
democracy. The question that remains and to be observed is to what extent –
as they have no true say in it (and are satisfied by such a position) – the
evaluated people are committed to take the evaluation procedure as their
practical benchmark.
2) In the second conception, the authority and the future evaluated people, by
common agreement, decide to build part or all of the modalities of the procedure,
including what and how to measure issues. In practice, it requires
that both sides commit themselves into deliberative procedures which try to
achieve deliberate decisions. At the difference from strategic decisions, deliberate
decisions are decisions that both sides have the effective intention to
apply. One will not go further, except to note the proximities with the concepts
of subsidiarity and of deliberative democracy. One cannot expect that the central
authority or the people spontaneously enter in such a demanding cooperative
process. In his works, John Dewey (1927) has in-depth explored the political
conditions making such frames of coordination possible. Dewey
understands democracy as a collective practice led by collective movements
that struggle for creating what Dewey calls publics, that is people gathering
together able to defend a cause (common goods for instance) and to build the
relevant knowledge for implementing this cause. When built along Dewey’s
lines, democratic quantification processes would bond the authority to implement
principles of social justice as well as criteria and procedures that would
have been collectively agreed and tested. Here we have the right format both
to implement and to make relevant research on quantification.

6. Conclusion

Quantification is plural. One can build several processes of quantification for a
given social activity. These processes will differ depending of the agreed principle
of justice among the participants. Such a plurality means that any quantification
process has to be situated, for the choices of what and how to quantify
depend of the situation, the activity, the people, and their principles of justice,
in other terms, the world (or the compromise between different possible
HSR 41 (2016) 2 │ 133

worlds) they agree they are living together. So, any quantification is at the
same time an evaluation based on explicit or implicit values. Another consequence
is that to be not only democratic, but basically correct in terms of representation
of the reality and fair in terms of justice values, quantification processes
cannot be built from above and from the external. They should involve,
from the beginning to the outcome, the people whose activity is the object of
quantification. Last but not least, one of the key questions often neglected on
quantification issues is what is worth to quantify and what is worth not to quantify.
For the sake of efficiency, for instance, it could be better for all to let
spaces of freedom for people in which what is going on is neither observed, nor
evaluated.
What precedes has to be taken both as a grid about what to observe and
how, and as general guidelines to build what should be in our view a satisfying
process of quantification; even if, until now processes of quantification in the
social world have not yet, except rare examples, followed such guidelines.
