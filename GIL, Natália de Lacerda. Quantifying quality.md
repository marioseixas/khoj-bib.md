In this article, I present an analysis of the relationships, observable in the
Brazilian case, between school failure rates and the measurement of teaching
quality. The option was to focus the discussions on the possibility of quantifying
the quality of teaching since the 20th century. Initially, it was necessary to
consider the polysemy of the term quality and its implications for quantification
processes. Examination of the documentation allowed us to see that, in Brazil,
the naturalization of the poor school performance of students and criticism of
the high failure rates, repudiated as a mechanism of selectivity and exclusion ,
coexisted for a long time . The link between school failure and teaching quality
is, even today, perceptible in the Brazilian educational context, as observed by
the analysis of the construction method of the Basic Education Development
Index (IDEB) which, since 2007, seeks to quantify the quality of the school in
Brazil. In this index, measuring the school knowledge that students master is not
a sufficient condition to consider quality education. It has also been assumed
that it is necessary to guarantee a normalized school flow, with a low incidence of failure and dropout.

Keywords: education, statistics, IDEB, education quality, teaching evaluation.

Currently, there is a clear concern about the quality of education

Academic research and the action of private non-profit organizations
have also devoted attention to measuring and/or debating the quality

of teaching. If measured by the right to access school institutions, the
quality of education would have improved, but still presenting
problems. It is positive that 99.2% of young people aged 6 to 14
attended school in 2017,3 but it is worth remembering that this means
that more than 211,000 people in this age group were out of school
(IBGE, 2018). In 2017, the average number of years of study for
people aged 25 or over in Brazil was 9.1 years, with 10.1 among
white people and 8.2 for the black population. If one prefers to
consider school flow indices, that is, statistics that indicate whether
those who enter the system regularly follow the school path
established by law, we have, in general terms, the following table:
between the 1st and 5th year of Education Fundamental4 failure, in
2017, was 5.2%; between the 6th and 9th years, it increased to 10.1%; in high school, the school failure rate

6 “Prova Brasil and the National Basic Education Assessment System (Saeb) are
large-scale diagnostic assessments developed by the Anísio Teixeira National
Institute of Educational Studies and Research (Inep/MEC). They aim to assess the
quality of teaching offered by the Brazilian educational system based on standardized
tests and socioeconomic questionnaires. In the tests applied in the fourth and eighth
grades (fifth and ninth years) of elementary school, students respond to items
(questions) in Portuguese, with a focus on reading, and mathematics, with a focus on problem solving.

it reached 10.8%.5 As failure is significant in Brazilian schools, we have
another index that we can use: the age-grade distortion. Thus, we know
that 95.5% of children aged 6 to 10 attended the initial years of Elementary
School at the expected age, with no significant difference between the
sexes. In the age group from 11 to 14 years old, the rate was 83.3% of
men and 88.0% of women at the age at which they ideally should attend
the final years of Elementary School. For those who are more concerned
with knowing how much students learn, we have, for example, data from
the Prova Brasil.6 In this case, a possible interpretation, based on the
scores obtained in the standardized tests, is that, among 5th grade
students , 56% present expected learning or beyond expectations in
reading and 44% in Mathematics; among those in the 9th grade, these
percentages would be 34% and 15% respectively.7
Despite the profusion of numbers, it is not unreasonable to ask: is it
possible to effectively quantify quality? What is the limit of statistics in the
task of allowing us to know the results of a country's education?
And, after all, what is quality? The issue is thorny, as we will see later,
and those who produce and analyze educational statistics generally know
this. However, such numbers are formulated and presented in such a
way as to make one believe that it is indeed possible to quantify quality.
The perspective is encouraging and, almost always, the excitement is
enough to end the discussion and move on to analyzing the numbers.
Hence, the difficulty in quantifying quality is considered a minor problem, at most

the social order partly owes its permanence to the imposition of classification
schemes which, by adjusting to objective classifications, end up producing
a form of recognition of this order that implies precisely the lack of
knowledge of the arbitrariness of its foundations: the correspondence
between objective divisions and the classificatory schemes, between
objective structures and mental structures, is at the root of a type of original
adherence to the established order.

Reification is just one of the difficulties that must be dealt with if one
intends to think with statistics. Such difficulties do not allow us to advocate the
abandonment of quantitative analyses. They are useful, very useful, they
undoubtedly contribute to the task of providing intelligibility to complex
situations, such as education. Perhaps the problem is succumbing to the
seduction of numbers and the necessary effort should be to distrust the feeling

of objectivity they give us. No, statistics are not objective. They are a useful
objectification resource – which is different – and they carry risks, side effects,
which we cannot ignore or disregard.

In the last three decades, an important critical literature on quantification
has emphasized that statistics are not a simple description of reality, they are,
on the contrary, the result of objectification processes defined by the categories
used, by the choice of what to measure, by the modes to observe (Hacking,
1990; Rose, 1991, 1999; Porter, 1995; Desrosières, 2000; Popkewitz, 2011,
among others). Such processes give numbers symbolic power and, being
produced and used by and for people, they also produce devices of
subjectivation. Bourdieu (1998, p. 117-118) highlights that

From scientific research to wide dissemination, the problem deteriorates.
Because, when it makes headlines in the newspapers, the “quality” of
education has already become a thing, we then have the reification of quality,
and there is no need to discuss what we are actually talking about again. The
numbers gain fluidity and circulate happily, from news to news, allowing for
good insights, but also almost any type of interpretative abuse.

It is in the sense of contributing to a critical analysis of education
statistics that, in this article, the focus is on the ways of quantifying the
quality of teaching. More especially, what I intended was to scrutinize
how, in the Brazilian case, school failure was taken as an indicator of the
lack of quality in Brazilian schools.8 To do so, I return the analysis to the
beginning of the 20th century, when we have for the first time the
systematic organization of education statistics in the country. This retreat
is explained by the intention to know how the arguments were presented
when establishing the democratic school in Brazil.9 As suggested by
Bourdieu (2014, p. 103), “the interest of the return to the genesis is that it
is very important because there is debates in the early days in which
things are said in all letters that later appear as provocative revelations to sociologists”.
The text is organized into three parts. Firstly, using the available
literature on the subject, although without being exhaustive, I analyze the
notion of quality in education. The polysemy that characterizes the term
makes the task difficult, but, even so, such an examination is unavoidable
if the intention is to quantify quality. Next, I locate, in Brazilian educational
debates, traces of what were considered to be elements articulated
around school quality and its measurement.
In this sense, it is important to observe that the quantification referred,
initially, to the characteristics and abilities of the student body; over time,
it also began to be mobilized to denounce the school's inability to comply with

Statistics produce what Bourdieu (1998) called a “ theory effect”,
that is, as they seek to provide forms of intelligibility of the world,
they collaborate in the construction of the conditions of existence of
what they intend to describe.

Such defenses had a strong influence on the way in which the Brazilian school was established
in legislation.

8 In common sense, however, a high failure rate is often considered an expression of quality.
Even many professors still think this way, despite official documents and specialized literature
for more than a century indicating the opposite. However, I will not deal with this in this article,
although it is a very important issue and still little studied.

9 In the 1930s, liberal educators defended the expansion of the democratic school,
understanding it as an institution that would guarantee equal opportunities for all and would
proceed with a selection that was considered fair because it was based on the innate talents of students.

Several authors highlight that the concern with the quality of education
does not cancel out the continuous attention that must be given to
guaranteeing access to schooling, embodied in the existence of places
in schools in sufficient quantities to meet all demand. In this sense, it is
worth noting that, as education has been proposed in most

After all, what is quality? This is difficult terrain, full of rocks and
tripping hazards. Initially, it is important to state that quality, especially
in education, is a polysemic concept. As for this observation, the many
authors who dedicate themselves to the examination of the question
are in agreement. There are several elements to take into account.
Without intending to establish a temporal sequence and, even less, any
hierarchy, let's start by noting that it is a historical concept, because it
changes over time, articulating itself to values, knowledge and
expectations socially shared in different periods. It is frequent that the
mention suggests a linear and progressive temporal succession, which
leads to believe that the variation of meaning of the term quality of
education would establish, in the historical transitions, total alterations
of meaning. Now, as we intend to argue throughout this article, the
analysis of historical processes leads us not to the understanding of a
sequence of meanings of quality that would replace their precedents,
but to the perception of the coexistence of meanings formulated in different temporalities.
Another aspect to be observed refers to the understanding, in the
case of education, that quality and quantity are complementary.

its social role. Finally, I present the concepts that guide the construction
of the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB), created in 2007,
and present some of its limits and recurrent criticisms. The intention
was not to carry out a detailed historical analysis, but rather to pursue,
with methodological rigor, the arguments that coexist, often in a
contradictory way, in debates on the quality of Brazilian education over
time.

How to quantify quality in education?

In contemporary societies as a universal right, quality education
only for a few people configures privilege and, therefore, lack of
quality from a social point of view.

190 Natália de Lacerda Gil

Understanding quality and quantity as articulated aspects makes it
possible to identify why, in Brazilian history, as in other countries, the
discussion appears to be strongly associated with enrollment totals. But
it doesn't hurt to remember a fact already widely evidenced in several
studies: “extending schooling is not, by itself, a guarantee of school justice.
In fact, everything depends on how the school is organized and what is
done in it” (Dubet, Duru-Bellat; Vérétout, 2012, p. 35). The notion of
quality in education associated with guaranteeing access for all to the
same school – of quality – has some pitfalls. Defending that everyone
has access to a quality school seems a noble and indisputable intention
in democratic societies. However, in this case, who is it about quality?

In what perspective? In line with which society project? As Esteban
(2008, p. 6-7) highlights,

quality is a polysemic, plastic word, which contains virtualities and
positivities, expresses a convergence of concerns, allowing the rapid
construction of a consensus by creating the idea of aggregation around
common commitments. These characteristics hide how much their
different meanings hold opposing and contradictory possibilities of
organizing the school as a social project.

By obliterating the polysemy of the term, the meaning constituted
in specific contexts is assumed to be universal and timeless. This
proceeds to “maintain the historical process of coloniality of power in
which relations of subordination are woven” (Esteban, 2008, p. 7).
Regarding the discourses that refer to the rights of “all children”,
Popkewitz (2011) observes that they give rise to practices of
identifying those who do not share the characteristics of “all children”,
that is, those who would need to be rescued and saved from their
original contexts because they were considered inadequate. When a standard is established

On the other hand, the function of the school, in the context of
globalization and in the face of neoliberal policies, strengthens the focus on
preparing individuals with mastery of applicable knowledge and in compliance
with demands of an economic nature (Stromquist, 2012). Thus, the
standardization of school content and evaluation processes is defended as
decisive for guaranteeing the quality of teaching. In this sense, it is necessary
to remember that, in recent decades, the discussion about quality has been
particularly prominent in business circles and this is not without consequences
in the area of education. According to Oliveira and Araújo (2005, p. 7),

On the one hand, there is the understanding of the role of the school for
human development, on the other hand, there are arguments that advocate
the role of the school for economic development. In the first case, the school
would be associated with the construction of a democratic society. Virginio
(2012, p. 179) highlights the difficulty of guaranteeing the full performance of
this function in the face of standardized evaluation criteria:

Thus, perhaps the most crucial aspect for the discussion on polysemy is
the notion that quality is linked to the conception of education considered. That
is, different educational paradigms – or, if you prefer, educational projects –
will engender distinct quality criteria and different perceptions of what quality
education is. If it is a fact that there are many conceptions of education that
can be described, it happens that two are the most recurrent in the debates
around the theme.

unique quality, there is the production of invisibility and subalternity of subjects
who do not fit the standard (Esteban, 2008).

This distinction is important as it draws attention to the fact that the
concept of quality, even in the business world, carries significant meanings.

public policies and the efforts that have been undertaken, in the sense
of guaranteeing school success, can ensure a better performance in
terms of expectations of success in relation to certain curricular
prescriptions. However, they are insufficient to account for the need
for an education consistent with a democratic society. It is about
thinking beyond the criterion of merit, or even the instrumental character of knowledge.

and different procedures. One should also not lose sight of the fact that a
significant part of the debate on quality in education is imported from the
business world and, even so, in this restricted scope, it embodies different meanings.

Thus, statistics cannot be a basic element to assess what is important –
as if only what is expressed in numbers were important.

If there is no agreement on what quality of education is, how would
it be possible to quantify it? The answer to this question is political, but it
also involves technical aspects. It is a political issue because it depends
on which social group has the most strength to impose its way of seeing.
The elites have greater power to reify quality, according to their conceptions
of school and society (Bourdieu, 2014). Having become a “thing”, quality
can be quantified, inevitably leaving out of the count a wide range of
aspects whose importance in the educational process is undeniable (such
as the development of empathy and learning to respect others, the
establishment of links between different generations, building self-esteem,
creative ability, among others). Now, this is an unavoidable effect of
quantification. As Afonso (2009, p. 13) argues , “not everything that counts
in education is measurable or comparable”.

The answer to the possibility of quantifying quality is also technical,
because it implies excluding everything that, even if consensually
considered relevant, cannot be expressed in numbers: for example, how
to objectively assess students' satisfaction in learning new knowledge?
How to know the development of students regarding

According to these authors, in some circumstances, the quality of
education has referred to the “final product”, the student who learned, or
it may also be an indication of a low cost process, especially low cost for
the State.

This becomes a problem when one loses sight of the fact that the
statistical representation of a phenomenon is just a way of seeing it,
meeting the criteria of the spaces of power; it may even be very useful in
certain circumstances, but it does not correspond to the totality of what is accounted for.

self-esteem, social skills and creativity? Or how to measure the
importance of the bond between generations established throughout
the educational process? The risk is that, as they cannot be
expressed in objective indices, attention and time will not be
devoted to such aspects that are essential in youth development
processes. This shows that the choice of categories in statistical
surveys, supposedly a purely technical issue, has an indelible
political dimension. As Rose (1991, p. 674) states,

The lack of consensus and all the complexity involved in
defining what “quality of education” means, however , have not
prevented quantification from being carried out for a long time.
Tacitly operating with this multiplicity of issues, concepts and
actions to quantify the quality of education were overlapping over
time. In the Brazilian case, as we will see below, measurement
dates back to the 1930s and was improved amid the debate about
what and how to quantify in quality. A brief historical excursion
allows us to examine the arguments and note the origin of the
“layers” of meaning that exist in the discussion today.

School failure was not always a problem in Brazilian schools
(Gil, 2018). Although since the installation of the first colleges, still
in the colonial period, there were school exams that students could
fail – a practice that continued in public classes during the imperial
period –, this occurrence is not mentioned in the documentation of
both periods as frequent or as problem. The apprehension of
school failure as a problem stems basically from the association of

Sociologias, Porto Alegre, year 23, n. 56, Jan-Apr 2021, p. 184-209.

paradoxically, in the same process in which numbers reach a privileged
status in political decisions, they simultaneously promise a
“depoliticization” of politics, redrawing the boundaries between politics
and objectivity, intending to act as automatic technical mechanisms to
make judgments, prioritize problems and allocate the scarce ones. resources.

However, even before this school phenomenon gained prominence
and could be statistically measured, the quantification of student
performance took its first steps in Brazil. Following the example of France,
initiatives were organized to apply psychological tests to students in order
to identify their capabilities and classify them by intelligence level. It is
important to note that the development of such measurements in France
took place at the request of the Ministry of Education, which intended to
solve the problem of students lagging behind in school learning, selecting
them to be taught in special classes, adapted to their needs. The difficulty
in ensuring the democratic principle of the right to education for all
resulted in the demand made by the French government to Alfred Binet,
in 1904, to “develop techniques for identifying children whose school
failure suggested the need for some form of special education” (Gould ,
2003, p. 152).

two aspects: on the one hand, the progressive adherence of Brazilian
society to the notion of democratizing schooling as a right and, on the
other, the production, since the 1930s, of more reliable, comprehensive
and regular education statistics.

In Brazil, such tests were assumed with optimism by educators at the
head of the school democratization project, in the 1920s and 1930s, who
were fully convinced of meritocratic principles and saw in schools an
institution capable of carrying out the fair selection of innate talents. 11
Statistics, in this sense, fulfilled the role of measuring the distance of
each individual in relation to the standard norm. Thus, a spectrum of
abnormality was created (Lima, 2018) which, based on performances in
psychological tests, served to classify students and engendered
processes of subjectivation. As Rose (1999) points out, statistics are part of

The intelligence tests developed by Binet allowed the creation of
scales for measuring IQ (intelligence quotient) and these scales traveled
the world, being adapted to different national contexts.10

It is important to note that the understanding of innate talents as a fair resource for the
selection and classification of students will have a long life in educational debates. For a
critique of the ideology of natural aptitudes, see Bisseret (1974).

in the initial classification for class groupings and application of teaching
programs etc., and in the periodical evaluations of the intimate process of
educational work and its practical effects, considering the extension and
composition of these programs, in addition to other objective tests, the
mental tests and pedagogical or schooling tests, those for the verification
and measurement of mental qualities, these for the verification of the
students' performance in the different disciplines.

The Brazilian educators who occupied prominent positions in the
bodies responsible for conducting educational policies, in the period,
showed strong adherence to liberal ideals. In the first decades of the
twentieth century, they vigorously defended the democratic school,
understanding by this expression a school in which absolutely all
children were guaranteed enrollment, whether boys or girls, poor or
rich. Enrollment guaranteed to all, the school would select, through its
own processes, the best of each generation. These would be provided
with a long schooling, so as not to waste their talents. For the others, it
would be foreseen courses of preparation for work, leading each person
to the position consistent with their abilities, so that each one would
give the best of himself for the progress of the nation. As an example,
observe what Teixeira de Freitas, one of the founders of the IBGE and
who, for many years, was at the forefront of the statistics produced by
the Ministry of Education and Health, says: “to be fair, education must
be extended to all citizens, with no privileges save the natural endowments of personal receptivity.”
(Freitas, 1945, p. 348). Jardim (1946, p. 460, emphasis added), from
the Education and Health Statistics Service of the Ministry of Education
and Health, in line with his contemporaries, considered tests to be a
fundamental resource for organizing education:

Rose (1999) also points out that statistics are also ways of producing
knowledge about students in order to support government actions on
specific populations, by proposing strategies for reform and prevention
of behaviors considered undesirable in the exercise of micropower.

the new student appears as an unknown; always offers a field for the
development of hopes: perhaps he is strong at work, an element that fits
well with the group, interested in school activities, compensating for the
efforts spent. The repeater is a failure – he has already revealed himself,
nothing is expected of him. Is it really worth keeping him in the school,
filling a vacancy and preventing, with his presence, the admission of another student?

failures are exact numerical data; but the criteria that determine them, as we
know, change from school to school. Will the 60% promoted in school A be
equivalent, in terms of educational level, to the 60% in school B? Perhaps
yes; maybe not. It is the school authority that examines – the inspector or
principal – and as there are “low” authorities, who are satisfied with little, there
are also “high” ones, willing to tighten the scrutiny of approvals (São Paulo, 1936, p. 3 ).

There is also mention of the recognition that, as school
approval was based on the results of the exams, it was possible
for teachers to start training students specifically for the tests, as
a way of improving the rates. Almeida Junior stated that “the fact
that we focus attention on the phenomenon of failures does not mean

But there is also, in the period, a specific debate about the
measurement instruments. The criteria considered by the teachers during
the exams differed from one school to another. Thus, for example, to
explain the approval rate of 1935, which was a little more favorable in
some educational institutions, Almeida Junior, who held the position of
manager of the state education system in São Paulo, mentioned the
variation in exam requirements as an explanation for differences:

In this sense, it is important to note that, in the early debates, the
notion of quality was associated with the innate abilities of students. In
other words, the problem of low performance in Brazilian schools,
expressed in high rates of failure and school dropout, would be, at least in
part, due to the lack of quality of the children who arrived at school . There
was an evident naturalization of low school performance in Brazil,
sometimes even expressed as inevitable. Cardoso's statement (1949, p.
74, author's emphasis) serves as an example :

Since the 1930s, Teixeira de Freitas indicated that the exclusive concern with

the expansion of the school, verified by the increase in enrollments, was insufficient.

According to him, the main problem of Brazilian schools concerned its low efficiency,

since the school had difficulty attracting the school-age population, as well as

maintaining attendance and guaranteeing approval of students from one grade to

the next. He was against the uncritical expansion of a school that, in his opinion,

needed to improve.

that the only thing we are asking of schools is to prepare students for exams” (São

Paulo, 1936, p. 3).

Anísio Teixeira (1935, p. 74), who was Director of Public Instruction in the

Federal District, also emphasized that the school failed to fulfill its social function by

failing and rejecting a significant part of the student body:

Throughout the period, the analysis of debates on Brazilian education allows

us to see the emergence of a discussion that shifts the cause of failure: from

evidence of the low capacity of students, it also becomes possible to indicate the

inability of the school to fulfill its social role . . So let's move on to this debate.

That's why I considered that

in terms of primary education would have to be, in our view, this:
“before more schools, better schools”. Understood as such, an inviting

it is not enough to have schools for the most capable, it is essential that there are

schools for everyone. It is not enough to have schools for everyone, it is essential that

everyone learn.

It is not difficult to assess how much the modification came to influence the concept

of school performance. Before, given the selective character, failure was almost the

index of teaching quality. If many failed, this meant that the judging criteria were really

students and their families (Patto, 1993), sometimes around the

discussion about a solution to the problem. In this sense, it is interesting
to note that the Revista Brasileira de Estudos Pedagógicos, official
journal of the National Institute of Educational Studies and Research
Anísio Teixeira (INEP), will serve as a space for assessing the
advantages and risks of establishing in Brazil the automatic promotion
(Fernandes, 2000). The arguments in favor pointed to the recognition
that education as a right for all could not be anchored in selective
pedagogical practices. Luiz Alves de Matos, for example, in an article
published in 1956, pointed out “that the elementary school is a matter of
law and that it should not become an agency for selecting privileged
talents, but should be a disseminator of education and culture at the
service of youth and democracy'” (Fernandes, 2000, p. 82). The
opposing arguments did not differ from the principle of the democratic
school, but warned of the risks of hasty action that could be inappropriate
for the Brazilian context. In this sense, Luiz Pereira, in an article from 1958, quoted by Fernandes (2000, p. 84), denounced

Quality measurement: IDEB as a measuring

Quantifying quality... 199

The end of the 20th century was also the period in which there was
wide diffusion of neoliberal policies. It was important, in this sense, to
achieve maximum efficiency with a minimum of public investment. Although
States still want schools to guarantee some level of social cohesion, in this
new context, they tend to reduce their participation in the provision of public
education (Stromquist, 2012). Alternatively, they began to focus attention
on processes of privatization, decentralization and accountability. Among
the control strategies that characterize neoliberalism, great importance has
been given to large-scale evaluations, which aim to measure the quality of
teaching as a way of inducing its increase, for example, through the
competitiveness generated between schools.

The elimination of school failure raised, however, questions about whether
it would not be just a way of “formally solving school failure (failure rates),
but not the real problem – that of student learning [...]” (Mainardes, 1998 ,
p. 25). In other words, these policies resulted in a significant reduction in
the failure rates in the networks where they were implemented, but they
suffered several criticisms and generated distrust about the ability to
maintain the quality of education in this way.

the marginalization and exclusion of the poorest. Some important public
education networks began to adopt cycles or continuous progression in the
organization of their schools, abandoning the annual serial progression that
provided for the possibility of failure at the end of the year, if the student
did not reach a sufficient score in the assessments carried out by each teacher.

From the 1990s onwards, guidelines on education produced by
international organizations emphasized the notion of equity as an
essential aspect (Klein, 2017). The World Conference on Education
for All, held in 1990 in Jomtien (Thailand), reiterated education as a
fundamental right for all and the World Declaration on Education for All:

satisfaction of basic learning needs, signed by the participating
countries , established that “basic education must be provided to all
children, youth and adults. Therefore, it is necessary to universalize
it and improve quality, as well as to take effective measures to
reduce inequalities” (Unesco, 1990, p. 4). The intention to guarantee
a “ minimum standard of learning quality” was linked to the
recommendation to “implement performance evaluation systems” (Unesco, 1990, p. 4).
Brazil followed this movement and, since that period, began to build
instruments to measure the quality of education that intended to assess
what students learned at school. In 1991, the Ministry of Education
instituted the Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB) whose
objective was to assess the quality of teaching through a sample
assessment, carried out every two years, of student performance in
standardized tests (Bonamino; Sousa, 2012) . In 1998, the National High
School Examination (ENEM) was created and, in 2005, the Prova Brasil
was added to the system , establishing non-sampling forms of assessment
that would allow the individualization of results by school. More than
providing parameters for measuring the teaching carried out, such policies
aim to direct curricular contents and pedagogical work. Bonamino and
Zákia Sousa (2012, p. 380, authors' highlights) analyze that

However, as, in the Brazilian case, the guarantee of access to basic
school was delayed and as permanence is not assured, the concerns with
the measurement of learning could not be disarticulated from the measures
of failure and school dropout,12 phenomena that are still very recurrent.

the dissemination media strategy, through rankings, although not official,
together with the distribution in schools of the content and skills matrix
used in the preparation of Portuguese language and mathematics tests,
introduces concrete perspectives of more direct interference in what
schools do and how they do it.

an educational system that systematically fails its students, causing
a large number of them to drop out of school before completing
basic education, is not desirable, even if those who complete this
stage achieve high scores in standardized exams. On the other
hand, a system in which students complete high school in the
correct period is not of interest if they learn very little. In short, an
ideal system would be one in which all children and adolescents
have access to school, do not waste time with repetition, do not
drop out of school early and, at the end of it all, learn.

Thus, a school whose students show good proficiency in the Prova Brasil,
has its IDEB penalized if it presents high rates of failure and dropout. This
evidences, in the conformation of the instrument, the concern with the
fulfillment of the legal precept of education as a right of all. It is also
consistent with what the National Education Plans (2001-2010 and
2014-2024) have been proposing when they indicate, among the goals, the
demand for regularization of school flow, intending to progressively make
failure and dropout rare events. In 2014, the PNE began to include
quantitative targets, however, without specifying the basis on which the
averages intended to be achieved were established. Detached from the
assessment of the objective conditions for achieving the indicated goals,
the numbers become random and express wishes disconnected from reality.

in the country. In 2007, therefore, INEP created an index that associated
both aspects. As stated by Fernandes (2007, p. 7),

With regard to performance, the data come from the Prova Brasil applied
every two years to students enrolled in the 5th and 9th years of Elementary
School and in the 3rd year of High School. With regard to performance,
passing allows assessing problems in the school flow, since the calculation
is made by the difference between those enrolled at the beginning of the
year and those approved, thus allowing to know the numbers of failure and dropout.

With that in mind, at that time, the Basic Education Development Index
(IDEB) was proposed , whose formula associates information on student
performance in standardized Portuguese and Mathematics exams and on
performance, by pass rates.

The IDEB was proposed as a way to establish a quality standard
in education in the country. This is an index designed to monitor
results by school, with the aim of providing information to education
network managers, supposedly accessible information to families
about the institutions where their children are enrolled, as well as
elements for evaluating Brazilian education as a whole. . Thus, it is
intended that the index serves to guide educational policies as well
as for social control over the quality of teaching. The specialized
literature has, however, pointed out some of its risks and limits, many
of which result from the inappropriate use of numbers. A central
aspect, in this sense, is that educational indexes foster the illusion
that it is possible to know objectively the quality of educational institutions. question the

Goal 7 of the National Education Plan explains that it intends to
establish, for Brazil, tangible goals in terms of quality of education
and make accountability viable, for which quantification is considered
fundamental.

It is also necessary to bear in mind that the IDEB does not allow the
assessment of added value (that is, the difference in proficiency between the
beginning and the end of schooling) and, also, that the standardized proficiency
exams do not assess content that is important to the training of students,
restricting up to reading and math. For example, components such as
Geography, Art and Science are left out , or even competences such as
valuing the diversity of knowledge, caring for oneself, others and the planet,
collaborating with the construction of a just society, democratic and inclusive
(Brasil, 2018, p. 9).

In addition, there has been unanimous criticism of the fact that the index
disregards the students' socioeconomic level, leading to the belief that schools
with a high IDEB would have better teaching than the others, when it is known
that the correlation between student performance and socioeconomic level is
always high.

translated as a faithful portrait of the quality of institutions (Almeida; Dalben;
Freitas, 2013, p. 1155).

14 It should be noted that there are differences between what the technical teams
producing statistics want from the numbers and what the managers intend when
ordering the creation of indexes. For these, the objective of inducing policies provided
by the dissemination of statistics is often more explicit, which, in their speech, appears
more as a distortion or abuse in the use of numbers. This aspect was not systematically
verified here, but it constitutes an important issue that deserves more accurate studies.

In spite of these considerations, widely known and considered by
statisticians and researchers who study the subject, the circulation of
numbers is detached from these reading keys and the figures gain
autonomy. The effects of the indices go beyond their initial propositions.14

There is a wealth of literature that shows that this is impossible. All
students have the right to learn, and the knowledge and skills specified
for basic education must be the same for all. However, obtaining this
learning in schools that serve students who bring less of their families
is much more difficult, a fact that must be considered when using the
learning indicator to compare schools and identify successes (Soares, 2011).

the use of an indicator as the sole measure of school and systems
quality will naturally make schools seek to maximize it and, as this
can be done in ways that are pedagogically inappropriate, it can
lead to a dysfunctional educational system.

Less than a functioning distortion, this is one of the characteristics of
quantification processes.

Assuming education statistics as an object of analysis, seeking to
scrutinize the way they are constructed and interpreted, corresponds
here to considering them as participants in educational processes – and
not mere measuring instruments. With regard to the quantification of
quality, the difficulty already begins with the definition of what an education of

Thus, for example, the reception of the index by schools can result in
actions whose only objective is to improve the index and not necessarily
to improve the quality of the pedagogical work. Soares and Xavier (2013,
p. 915), point out that

It is therefore necessary to consider the subjectivation effects that
IDEB causes in the school space (Klein, 2017). Establishing a set of
aspects from which quality is inferred, even if it is a methodologically
relevant resource, comes up against the fact that reception of the index
ends up limiting efforts only with regard to this restricted set. That is, if
the verified proficiency is limited to reading and mathematics, it is not
necessarily because the formulators of the index consider that this is the
only task of the school, but because this would be a sufficient parameter
for a standardized calculation. However, school subjects, education
network managers and the mainstream press tend to receive this
methodological restriction as a pedagogical prescription regarding the
curricular contents with which they should deal. Such effects are beyond
the control of statisticians, causing the measuring instrument to act in
the construction of what it supposedly should only measure.

describe the objective mechanisms that determine the continued elimination
of disadvantaged children. Indeed, it seems that the sociological explanation
can fully account for the differences in success that are most often attributed
to differences in gifts. [...] The cultural heritage, which differs [...] according
to social classes, is responsible for the initial difference of children in the
face of the school experience and, consequently, for the success rates
(Bourdieu, 2012, p. 41-42 ).

quality. Far from being a simple and consensual issue, what I sought to
underline was the fact that such conceptions are the result of sociohistorical
processes that, in the midst of constant disputes, engender the
coexistence of meanings that do not always agree. Such meanings, in
turn, are mobilized in current debates, with varying weight and effectiveness.
The second element that I intended to highlight in this article was the
understanding, resulting from the analysis of historical sources, that,
frequently, what is considered as a measure of the quality of teaching is
the examination of the student's capacities. Here it is worth explaining an
important sociological issue, addressed by Bourdieu in several of his
works. The analysis of the quantification processes of school failure has
contributed to

The tradition of assessing the quality of teaching by measuring what
students know is maintained at IDEB. Although this index seeks to balance
verification of student performance in standardized tests with quantitative
data on school flow, the focus remains limited to students. There is no
mention of the infrastructure conditions of the schools, there is no
consideration given to the training and remuneration of teachers and other
education workers, the public and/or private expenditure per student is not
taken into account, that is, the socioeconomic level of the students is not
included in the calculation. families and resources devoted to education.
This way of quantifying quality suggests an equation that is too simple,
leaving out of the analysis an important part of the complexity of the social
structure that permeates and constitutes the school institution.

Thus, one of the effects of quality quantification that I intended to
emphasize in this article concerns the excessive simplification of the issue
of quality in education expressed by statistics. If, on the one hand, numbers
are a useful objectification resource that helps in the analysis of complex
situations and in making political and educational decisions, on the other,
they lead us to assume that everything that matters would be expressed statistically.
As Desrosières (2000, p. 9) highlights, it is necessary to understand how
social facts are transformed into statistics, taking into account that “the
history of its gestation allows us to outline, retracing old controversies and
debates, a space for articulations between technical languages and their
uses in social debate”. From my point of view, it is not a question of
abandoning the use of numbers, but of being more attentive to its risks and
limits (Gil, 2019).

Since quality education is a right guaranteed by Brazilian legislation, it
is necessary to take into account yet another fundamental aspect. In a
society enthusiastic about “objectivity”, to tell something is, as already
mentioned, to describe it, to make it exist. Hence a dilemma: how to
guarantee the right to education without measures, without parameters,
without statistics? Given this, some authors defend the indispensability of
objectively establishing quality standards in education (Oliveira; Araújo,
2005). The question is not of little importance, but its positive aspect does
not eliminate the risks already mentioned. The space for clashes – of ideas
and policies – is, of course, open. Understanding statistics as an element
mobilized in this game is already a less restricted way of taking it into
consideration.
