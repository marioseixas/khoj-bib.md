The Sheriff of Nottingham Hypothesis:
A Tribute to Theodore Eisenberg

by

Marcelo Nunes, Ivan Ribeiro, Pedro Roquim, and Julio Trecenti∗

We consider what we call the Sheriff of Nottingham hypothesis: that the government
of Brazil, which at the same time is party to litigated cases and the enforcer
of tax laws, constantly enacts norms that seek to strengthen its side. We test this
hypothesis and observe that litigants adapt to new proportions of decisions favoring
tax authorities, with more sophisticated litigants seizing profits beyond those
of ordinary citizens. Our proposal is that this dynamic adaptation takes considerable
time; therefore, it is possible to detect the effect of changes in the law, despite
the selection effect explored by, among others, Theodore Eisenberg. (JEL: C34,
K34, K41)

1 Introduction

Decisions in judicial cases are examined in a wide range of fields, from law to economics
to political science. Researchers look for evidence to corroborate hypotheses
on social phenomena, for example, to underscore claims of racial or gender discrimination
in the workplace, to examine the judicialization of politics, and to evaluate
other hypotheses. Judicial decision-making can be also a fertile ground to examine
the effects of legislative initiatives, so it can be employed to answer the question
posed by this 32nd Seminar on New Institutional Economics – does the law deliver?
Our proposal in this empirical article is to test the hypothesis that recent legislative
initiatives in Brazil favor tax authorities. We call this proposal the Sheriff of
Nottingham hypothesis. In the following subsections, we delineate this hypothesis

precisely and examine the feasibility of an empirical test. We propose that the dynamic
nature of the adjustment in the pool of litigated cases presents an opportunity
for an empirical strategy, which is a claim that appears new in empirical works
in the field. Previous versions of this work focused too much on the proportion
of plaintiff-winning cases, showing how our empirical findings support a fifty–fifty
proportion favoring each part. Although a relevant empirical finding, this proportion
is not the most important finding in our paper, which concentrates on the evidence
showing a dynamic adaptation of this proportion to new legal standards. In that
matter, the level of this proportion is not so important as its change.1

1.1 The Sheriff of Nottingham Hypothesis

Brazil is affiliated with the civil-law tradition, where the law, rather than precedent,
has a major influence on judicial decisions on litigated cases.2 This provides an
opportunity to test for the effects of law by looking at judicial decisions. Discussions
about taxes in such a setting are particularly interesting in that one of the litigants,
the government (represented in these cases by the tax authorities), also has the power
to enact rules to discipline judicial discussions in tax cases. Indeed, the executive
branch, in Brazil, has a large ability to enact laws in comparison with other countries.
It can enact rules relating to its regulatory powers, can start the legislative process
of initiating a new law, and can even enact decrees that amount to new law under
the rubric of medidas provisorias ´ . There is, for sure, the need to show urgency and
relevance in these cases, but such requirements are seldom observed in practice.
In the past, following the enactment of Brazil’s 1988 Constitution, tax laws
were usually poorly designed. Consequently, the country saw a huge increase in
administrative and judicial tax litigation. As time passed, tax authorities resorted
more and more to legislative initiatives to fix holes in tax regulations. Whereas in the
past these reforms were aimed at mending poorly designed tax laws, today they may
be looked on as an instrument for the government to have its way in imposing more
and more taxes without regard for constitutional safeguards and taxpayer rights.
As in the fable of the wolf and the lamb, the government could be resorting to
excuses to justify questionable standards in tax laws. We named this explanation
of the government’s behavior the Sheriff of Nottingham hypothesis (Ribeiro, 2006,
pp. 23–61, referred to the Robin Hood story in a closely related work, examining the
selection hypothesis and the possibility of favoring one party in judicial decisions).3

1 We thank especially the discussants for our paper, Jonah Gelbach and Peter Moffatt,
as well as Christoph Engel, for bringing this point to our attention. 2 There is a long tradition discussing the differences between the civil-law and
common-law traditions; the most recent spurt of theoretical and empirical works in the
field started with Djankov et al. (2003). For a recent account of this debate, see La
Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2008). 3 The name of the article and its main hypothesis were inspired by Glaeser,
Scheinkman, and Shleifer (2003), which first talked of a King John redistribution as
opposed to a Robin Hood redistribution.

The sheriff in several versions of the Robin Hood story is the greedy agent of Prince
John, acting in questionable ways as his tax collector.

1.2 The Validity of Inferences from Litigated Cases

In this empirical article, we try to find evidence of this bias by examining judicial
decisions in tax cases. We look for the influence of changes favorable to tax
authorities in law on the proportion of taxpayers winning in litigated cases.
However, for some 30 years now, the validity of inferences about the underlying
population of disputes drawn from a sample of litigated cases has been called into
question. The main claim, put forward by Priest and Klein (1984),4 is that people
decide beforehand whether to file a suit when involved in a conflict, and they do so
taking into account the chances they have to win, so we do not observe a random
sample when examining cases that have gone to trial.
The Priest–Klein model has been described countless times (citations of the
paper are in the thousands)5 and has become a central paradigm in the quantitative
analysis of law. Some authors even make the claim for a specific field of quantitative
research in law, called jurimetrics, in the consequences of the selection-of-disputes
hypothesis.6 Donohue III (1988, p. 911) criticizes law-and-society scholars for
not accounting for their predictions (“just as theoretical work without empirical
verification is of little value, empirical work not guided by an intelligent theoretical
framework can be fruitless”).
The main hypothesis of the model is that one would observe a proportion of
decisions favoring each party – plaintiffs and defendants – in litigated cases that
does not reflect the real proportion for the whole population of potential claims.
The model also states as a hypothesis that, under reasonable assumptions, one
would observe a fifty–fifty proportion of decisions favoring each party – plaintiffs
and defendants – in litigated cases. Partisans of asymmetric-information models of
litigation called into question the validity of that hypothesis; among those we can
mention Shavell (1996). Although our empirical findings show a trend towards this
equilibrium, the fifty–fifty proportion of taxpayers’ winning in litigated cases is not
central for our empirical strategy. As one can see from the development in the next
sections, our empirical strategy relies in the change in this proportion, and not in its

4 The paper states the selection hypothesis clearly and gives several examples
where the rule applies, but there are also some forerunners. Tollison (ed.) (1980) presented
an intuitive version of the rule, and Danzon and Lillard (1983) also stressed the
selection effects.
5 A quick search (done on April 16, 2014) in Google Scholar points to more than
2,000 citations of the paper. 6 See, for example, Ribeiro (1998), stating that “the analysis of judicial decisions in
such form wouldn’t be, when taking into account the Priest and Klein hypothesis, an
easy task in the narrow framework of econometric analysis. This is why there would
be the need for a specific field for quantitative analysis in law, which I call jurimetrics”

level.
7 To understand this fifty–fifty result, let us look briefly at the model and its
main assumptions.8
A party involved in an everyday conflict, and that finds itself in a position to
seek reparation for some sort of damage, must decide if it will go to court to
demand what it thinks is appropriate. Before going to court, this party must weigh
the possible gains and costs of doing so, confronting those with any extrajudicial
settlement the other party is willing to offer. The chances in a judicial case can be
assessed by comparing the quality of the case with the standard courts use to grant
victory in a trial. The quality can be seen as a compound of the evidence, precedents
or legislation favoring the plaintiff, conditions to support the litigation, and other
aspects. The underlying quality of filed cases has, as an assumption of the model,
a standard normal distribution.
Let us denote by D the decision standard that must be met by the plaintiff for
the judge to concede whatever is claimed. Every case that meets or exceeds this
standard D will be awarded a favorable decision, whereas those that find themselves
below this standard will not. Plaintiffs and defendants, while negotiating on any
possible settlement before going to court, form unbiased estimates of the quality
of the case. Let us call this imperfect (although, once more, unbiased) estimate Y
.
Therefore, the assessment of the quality of the case formed by each part can be
expressed as Y + εY
p for the plaintiff and Y + εY
d for the defendant. The errors in both
estimates are drawn from independent normal distributions with equal variances,9,10
and the subscripts stand for plaintiff (p) and defendant (d).
The plaintiff will settle and refrain from bringing the case if his or her demand
is less than the defendant’s offer. In this calculation the plaintiff will consider his
or her expected profit from the settlement (i.e., the probability Pp of victory times
the amount J to be awarded in the case he or she wins the case), the cost Cp
of litigating, and the cost Sp of the settlement, which can be expressed in the form
Pp J − Cp + Sp. Likewise, the defendant will offer Pd J + Cd − Sd . Suppose the costs,
both for litigation and settlement, are the same for the plaintiff and the defendant,
and the stakes at the trial are also the same.11 Priest and Klein then claim that cases

7 We thank Christoph Engel for bringing this argument to our attention. 8 The discussion here follows closely Waldfogel (1993). 9 Waldfogel departs slightly from Priest and Klein’s notation by allowing uncertainty
to derive both from the variation in the standard decision Y and from the errors
in estimating the quality of the case by each party. This distinction is not so important
for the cursory discussion in our paper. See Waldfogel (1993). 10 The requirement of equal variances is relaxed in asymmetric-information
models, resulting in a different, but stable, proportion of winning rates. In this case
the proportion would be favorable to the party that has a more accurate evaluation of
the quality of case. 11 Different stakes in the case, for example flowing for reputation aspects, also
change the proportion. Parties that lose more from an unfavorable decision would
bring only stronger cases to trial, and as a result would have a higher proportion of decisions
in their favor.

go to trial when the difference between the evaluations of the quality of the case is
greater than the cost of going to trial, that is, if Pp − Pd > (C − S)/J.
12

With that structure, one can see that cases will go to trial only if there is a substantial
disagreement over the probability of plaintiff victory. Cases further away
of the standard D will be settled, and only cases with quality around the decision
standard will be tried. This yields a filter resulting in a plaintiff victory rate of 50%,
regardless of the proportion of possible winning cases among the population of
conflicts. An increase in the uncertainty about the court standard or the reduction in
litigation costs will entail an increase in litigated cases, bringing the proportion of
plaintiff victories close to the value observed in the population.
The model could explain even a proportion favoring one party when, in reality,
there is a strong bias against that very same party. Suppose a party is disfavored by
judges, so there is a bias against him or her. For example, judges could grant more
decisions against large corporations in tort cases, or they could discriminate against
gender or race. If they know about this bias beforehand, the disfavored parties will
settle more often, bringing to court only strong cases. The decision not to bring the
case would then stem from the violation of some of the assumptions in the model.
For example, the disfavored party could have a higher stake in the case, perhaps on
account of reputational effects. At the end, because they bring only strong cases for
trial, the plaintiffs’ proportion of victory could fall below the predicted fifty–fifty
value; the odds for the entire population of conflicts would still be in the plaintiff’s
favor.
More than the proposed winning proportion of 50%, what this modeling tells
us is that one cannot draw any inferences about the underlying conflicts from the
litigated cases, as these are not a random sample of the conflicts. However, a recent
examination of Priest and Klein’s hypothesis shows that the fifty–fifty proportion is
still valid under a wide variety of conditions and that one must be very careful in
explaining departures from this ratio in empirical data.

1.3 The Static Nature of Priest and Klein’s Model

One aspect of the Priest–Klein model that we will address extensively in this paper
is its static nature. The supposition in most of these studies is that the relationship
between filed cases and the underlying population of disputes does not change
over time. For sure, there is a selection effect in these models, and litigated cases
are not a simple random sample of conflicts. However, this finding does not mean
that the proportion of litigated cases (whether higher or lower than the observed
characteristics of the population) in these models would change over time.
A careful reading of these studies would show that there is an assumption that
this proportion does not vary over time. Several studies, however, depart from

12 Priest and Klein assume that the proportion of the costs, (C − S)/J, is 0.33 on
the basis of the lawyers’ contingency fees, in order to close the model. Such assumptions
are not so important for the discussion here, and we will spare the reader further
arguments.

this assumption, as we see in Henderson and Eisenberg (1990), Donohue III and
Siegelman (1991), Eisenberg and Henderson (1992), and Siegelman and Donohue
III (1995). We address the dynamic aspects of case selection in this research, and
propose a structure for the selection mechanism that allows us to test for the effects
of law on judicial decision-making.
Siegelman and Donohue III (1995) show that the selection effect does not dominate
completely, so we can still observe some effects of the change in the legal
standard on the results in litigated cases. Klerman and Lee (2014, p. 5), by using
a model that takes account of information asymmetry between litigants, assure us
that “plaintiff trial win rates can provide useful information about the law, decisionmakers,
and legal decisionmaking.” The suggestion in those cases, however, is that
selection does not operate alone, so one can still see some of the effects of changes in
law, in the decision-makers, or in the legal decision-making process in litigated cases.
Our contention is that information about the proportion of winning cases takes
time to spread. This violates several of the suppositions in those models. As stated
by Klerman and Lee (2014, p. 5, emphasis added), “changes in legal rules, decisionmakers,
or case characteristics will produce predictable changes in the percentage
of plaintiff trial victories only holding other factors equal. If other factors change
– such as the distribution and characteristics of the underlying disputes, levels of
uncertainty, the asymmetry of the stakes, and the distribution of information – then
the effect of shifting the legal standard on the percentage of plaintiff victories may
well be swamped by the effects of these other factors.”

2 Eisenberg’s Work

Professor Theodore Eisenberg has made several theoretical and empirical contributions
to the discussions on Priest and Klein’s hypothesis. On the theoretical side, for
example, he proposed that variation in costs to litigate will entail differences in the
trial rate (the proportion of filed cases that are tried to a verdict) and in the plaintiff
win rate (Eisenberg and Farber, 1997). The extent of his contribution, however, is
magnified by his empirical pieces, amounting to dozens of important and influential
articles.
For example, Eisenberg (1989) tests more than 57,000 trials between 1978 and
1985 and shows that only in 16 out of 72 subject-matter categories are plaintiff
success rates between 0.45 and 0.55, but he proposes that this may be the result of
the poor quality of the cases selected for trial.13 Eisenberg (1990) notes how these
proportions vary among subject classes and geographic areas, suggesting that the
work of Priest and Klein, although presenting a good baseline analytical tool, must
be extended to account for these disparities. Eisenberg and Henderson (1992, 1993)
propose that there was a reversal in the pro-plaintiff bias in tort cases in both state
courts and federal district court cases on product liability.

13 His contribution on federal civil rights and prisoner cases includes several research
pieces; see Eisenberg and Schwab (1989, 1987), Schwab and Eisenberg (1988).

All of this empirical experience explains the enthusiasm Professor Eisenberg
showed for the pioneering massive data collection and quantitative analyses undertaken
in Brazil by the Brazilian Jurimetric Association. Although one of the authors
of this work began dealing with the selection effect a long time ago,14 to this day
legal and economic scholars in the country try to make inferences from litigated
cases, for example by pointing out the fifty–fifty proportion of cases won by each
party in several empirical studies (dealing with labor cases, civil litigation, credit
cases, and others) as definitive proof that the country has a fair and unbiased judicial
system.
In addition to its theoretical and empirical findings, this study aims to honor
Professor Eisenberg’s memory and to draw once more the attention of law academics
to the selection of case hypotheses, taking into account very recent development in
the discussion.

3 Tax Laws in Brazil

The selection of disputes for the litigation framework will be employed to test
the hypothesis of a bias favoring tax authorities in the administrative adjudication
of tax cases. We proposed that a recent legislative initiative, which resulted in the
replacement of the previous Tax Payers Council by an Administrative Tax Appellate
Court, worsened the situation, resulting in an even stronger bias. In this section, we
present a brief overview of the evolution of tax laws and tax litigation in the country,
clearly delineating the reasons that underscore the hypothesis of a pro-tax-authority
bias. In the next sections, we present the empirical strategy we propose to identify
these unintended effects of the law.
In Brazil, discussions on tax issues begin within the administrative sphere by
means of tax assessments, instruments through which tax authorities assess taxes
that are considered due from the taxpayers. These tax assessments can be administratively
questioned by taxpayers within administrative courts, which have existed
in Brazil since the beginning of the 20th century. The importance attributed to these
courts is related to their power of reviewing acts performed by administrative authorities
– they can, for instance, discharge the amount initially considered to be
due.
As noted above, tax laws in Brazil were, for a long time, poorly designed, so tax
authorities exerted regulatory powers to amend those flawed laws. We believe that
this use of regulatory powers degenerated into continual changes in the rules of the
game to favor the government.15

14 See Ribeiro (1998) for an early acknowledgement of the effects of Priest and
Klein in quantitative analysis of judicial decisions, also presented in Ribeiro (1998).
Identification strategies to circumvent the selection effect can be found in Ribeiro
(2006).
15 There are several examples of such behavior, as in the case of the enactment of
Law 10.637/02 and Law 10.883/03 to broaden the incidence of two contributions (PIS

(2015) 129 The Sheriff of Nottingham Hypothesis

One of these changes, the creation of CARF, will be used in the empirical test of
our Sheriff of Nottingham hypothesis. The purported reason for the replacement of
the old court was the need to improve the court’s productivity. To this end, as spelled
out in the justification of the law, there was a new allocation of jurisdiction for trial
(based on types of taxes). Whereas before there were three taxpayer councils, each
one in charge of a specific class of cases, these agencies are now combined in the
CARF, the sole authority responsible for judging and deciding all administrative
proceedings related to federal taxes.
In addition to the reform in jurisdiction, tax courts were forbidden to deny the
application of a given law under the justification of unconstitutionality. This is
a major change, because former administrative courts had that power. In other
words, they could declare a tax law unconstitutional even if no such opinion on that
law had been issued by the Brazilian Supreme Court or any other judicial body.
While in some countries this change would sound natural, it goes against tradition
in constitutional control in Brazil. Brazil has a hybrid system, which combines
centralized judgment of constitutionality by the Supreme Court with the diffused
judgment exerted by other judicial bodies. The motive for the changes would be, in
our hypothesis, more related to the desire to increase the odds in favor of the tax
authorities’ success in tax discussions than to bring more rationality to the system.
The examination of the intent of the law through litigated cases could be problematic,
as we observed in the previous discussion of selection effects. We believe,
however, that there is a simple empirical approach flowing from the dynamic nature
of the adjustment to the Priest–Klein hypothesis. In the next section, we examine
traditional approaches to selection problems, and discuss why the approach we
propose would be an acceptable one.

4 The Empirical Models

Selection models are pervasive in applied social sciences and an intrinsic trait
of human behavior. In the next subsections, we explore two approaches to the
problem, the standard sample selection model and a simple treatment-effects model
(section 4.1). This subsection literally reproduces Winship and Mare (1992), adding
some few comments linking their modeling to our hypothesis. We move next to
a dynamic examination of the problem to show how a simpler approach may suffice
(section 4.2).

4.1 Traditional Approaches

To understand the sample selection bias, we need to look at the structure of selection
(see Winship and Mare, 1992, pp. 329–332). First, we need to differentiate truncation
from censoring. The former occurs when observations where the value of the

and COFINS), and the enactment of Law 10.865/04, extending the incidence of two
contributions (PIS/Pasep and COFINS) to the import of goods and services.

dependent variable is beyond a certain threshold are excluded. Consequently, for any
value of the independent variable, observations with large positive errors are eliminated
from the sample, thus causing negative correlation between the independent
variable and the error term.
Unlike truncation with explicit selection (that is, the exclusion of all observations
where the dependent variable exceeds a threshold), censoring occurs when these
observations are included, but all we know about them is the value of the independent
variable and that the dependent variable is above a given threshold. If, for example,
we code the dependent variable in those observations as being equal to the threshold,
OLS estimates will be biased and inconsistent.
The selection, for both the truncated and the censored sample, could be incidental,
which means that truncation or censoring is a stochastic function of the dependent
variable. In the classical example of labor economics, where we are interested in the
earnings of female workers, the chance that the wage is not observed is a function of
some covariates and the expected wage itself. If the prospective wage is low enough,
some female workers may decide not to take a job, so making the observation of
their wages impossible.
When we are trying to assess the chances plaintiffs have of winning when filing
a case, we face a similar problem. We just observe the result for those cases where
the plaintiff decided to bring a case, which ultimately would be a function of the
chance of winning itself. Cases with a low chance of winning would not be brought
to court, because plaintiffs anticipate they will lose in addition to having to bear
litigation costs. When the chances are high, we would not observe the case either,
because this time, the defendant would settle to avoid the extra costs of litigating
the case. This can be represented as a tobit model:16

Y∗ (1) 1i = Xiβ + εi ,

Y1i =
Y∗1i
if Y∗
1i > 0 ,
0 if Y∗
1i ≤ 0 , (2)

where Y∗
1i is an unobserved continuous latent variable (for example, the chance of
winning a case), Y1i is the observed variable (the actual result, either winning or
losing the case), Xi is a vector of values of the independent variables, β is a vector
of coefficients, and εi is the error term. The assumptions of the model are that the
error term εi is uncorrelated with the independent variables Xi and that they are
independent and identically distributed (iid). The threshold in (2) can be changed in
order to accommodate any other real situation, rendering the model quite flexible.
Estimates of (1) using the OLS approach are subject to selection bias, in that for
observations where Y1i > 0 the model implies that

Y1i = Xiβ + E[εi|Y∗
1i > 0] + ηi
= Xiβ + E[εi (3) |εi > −Xiβ] + ηi ,

16 The discussions in this and the next sections can be found in Winship and Mare
(1992, pp. 335ff.) and Maddala (1986).

where ηi is the difference between εi and E[εi|Y1i > 0] and is uncorrelated with both
terms. The selection bias occurs because E[εi|εi > −Xiβ] in (3) is a function of
−Xiβ. The tobit model has been used in a variety of situations, but what we propose
in this work is that the Priest–Klein model is of a different nature, akin to a standard
sample selection model.
We will develop this rationale further ahead, but our proposition is that there is
a second variable that affects whether the dependent variable is observed. Our claim,
to be substantiated with empirical evidence, is that it is not only the present chance
of winning that affects this chance, but also that past patterns of perceived chance
are influential. For now, just consider that there is a second variable Y∗
2i that affects
whether Y1i is observed or not, so the previous model becomes

Y∗
1i = Xiβ + εi ,

Y1i =
Y∗1i
if Y∗
2i > 0 ,
0 if Y∗
2i ≤ 0 .

In the most usual form Y∗
2i is determined by a binary regression model as

Y∗
2i = Ziα + νi ,

Y2i =
1
if Y∗
2i > 0 ,
0 if Y∗
2i ≤ 0 , (4)

where Y∗
2i is a latent continuous variable. If, as in our case, Y1i is a dichotomous
variable, and εi and νi follow a bivariate normal distribution, then we have a bivariate
probit selection model. Similarly to the previous case, the OLS estimators here are
subject to selection bias. To see this, note that when Y∗
2i > 0, it follows that

Y1i = Xiβ + E[εi|Y∗
2i > 0] + ηi
= Xiβ + E[εi|νi − Ziα > 0] + ηi ,

and that the OLS regression of Y1i on Xi is biased and inconsistent if εi is correlated
with νi + Ziα, which will occur if the error term εi is correlated with either νi or Zi.
An alternative view of the problem would consider the selection as similar to the
estimation of treatment effects in the case of nonrandom assignment. In this case,
the trial amounts to the treatment, and plaintiff decides whether or not to submit
a case to trial, taking into account the chances of winning. We are looking, with
this approach, for the effect of a dichotomous variable Y2 (if the case was tried)
on a continuous variable Y1, the chance of winning the case. The equation below
expresses this case:

(5) Y1i = Xiβ + Y2iγ + εi ,

where the treatment effects are expressed by γ . Were the assignment to the treatment
to be random, the equation (5) estimated by OLS would be consistent. However,
when the assignment to the treatment Y2i is a function of the error term εi , there is
an endogeneity problem, to be solved with instrumental-variable methods if there
are good instruments for Y2i .

The problem with this estimation in our research is that we do not observe all
occurrences of Y2i in (4), so we are unable to estimate the selection model properly.
To contrast our case with a similar study where it is possible to estimate the selection
model, consider Ichino, Polo, and Rettore (2003). They examine the selection effects
in labor cases in Italy, looking at the firing of workers for misconduct. Unlike our
case, they can observe all the steps in the selection, as described below:

(i) Reports of misconduct are brought to the management staff, which must decide
either to notify the worker or not.
(ii) After notifying the worker, management decides about the firing, taking into
account the seriousness of the violation and weighing the chances that the
worker may appeal to labor courts to reverse the dismissal.
(iii) After being fired, the worker must decide whether to file a case or not.
(iv) Conditional on the filing of the case, we can observe a decision either granting
reversal to plaintiff or maintaining dismissal.

The faithful registering of all reports of misconduct, notifications to the worker,
cases where the company decided to fire the worker, and, finally, the few cases where
the fired worker decided to file a case allows the researchers to easily calculate the
Heckman estimator. As we can see from the description of the data in section 5, we
are unable to employ the same approach. We also would experience some problems
in using the instrumental variables (IV) approach suggested before, applying the
estimation of treatment effects to the case, because there is no observable instrument
for the first phase of estimation.

4.2 The Dynamic Selection of Cases

The Priest–Klein model has a static nature, expressed in the assumptions the authors
make. First, the selection of disputes for litigation is framed as a one-shot game,
where each party decides right away whether to settle or go to court. Moreover,
to do so each party only evaluates the judicial standard and the quality of the
case at hand, with a minor role for previous experiences and other sources of
information. The fifty–fifty rule also implies not only that the decision to litigate is
endogenous, but also that it is simultaneous; therefore, we always see such cases in
equilibrium. We suggest that this may not take proper account of the dynamics of
litigation.
Parties learn from previous litigations, even if they are not involved in them, and
adapt to this new information with some delay. The fraction of winning plaintiffs in
previous litigations influences the decisions and ultimately the volume of litigated
cases in subsequent periods. If this fraction becomes more favorable to plaintiffs,
more cases will be brought to the courts, and the expected quality of these new cases
will be lower than the quality of those already in the pool of litigated cases. The
result is that in the next period the fraction of winning plaintiffs will drop.
The reverse also can happen. If the fraction of winning plaintiffs becomes less
favorable, then in subsequent periods potential plaintiffs with lower-quality cases

will refrain from bringing their cases. This will increase the quality in the pool
of litigated cases in the next period, thereby increasing the fraction of winning
plaintiffs. Once an equilibrium is reached, we will observe the relative stability of
the plaintiffs’ winning proportion that Priest and Klein suggest.
Our Sheriff of Nottingham hypothesis fits nicely into the test of our empirical
suggestion. Because tax authorities overuse their normative powers to increase
tax collections, we should observe several shifts in the legal standard observed in
litigated cases. Plaintiffs would respond to these shifts by seeking new adjustments,
so the expected behavior of this proportion would be a sinusoidal one converging to
the natural portion of decisions favoring each party.
What we see in the empirical works mentioned here is that they usually report
the total number of litigated cases. We suggest that disaggregating these data over
time would allow us to see a pattern showing the proportion of winning plaintiffs
evolving around 0.50 (or any other natural fraction of winning cases, given the
differences in stakes and in variances).
Figure 1 shows the disaggregated data for litigated cases at the Administrative
Tax Appellate Court, showing the proportion approaching the equilibrium 0.50. We
also note that when the government brings an appeal, the proportion of decisions
favoring taxpayers is greater than when taxpayers do (see the evolution around the
90th percentile in the graph). This result is most likely due to a rule requiring the

tax authorities to appeal in cases involving amounts above 1 million reais.17 This
rule violates Priest and Klein’s basic assumption, that both parties should decide
whether to litigate.18
If there is a delayed effect of the proportion of plaintiffs’ victories in one period
on that in the next, any disturbance that changes this proportion should be noticeable
in the first period, being diluted in subsequent periods until the fifty–fifty (or some
other) equilibrium is reestablished. For example, a change in the judicial standard
against which the case is compared or any sort of institutional change that biases
the judges in favor of one of the parties could be detected in subsequent periods,
with no need for one of the selection models discussed previously.

5 Data and Descriptive Statistics

5.1 Data Collection

We collected the data directly from the Administrative Tax Appellate Court website,
using web scraping techniques. We downloaded all the decisions for each year,
generating a single HTML file for each one. We then parsed those files to obtain
semistructured data, assembling a file with the following variables:

(i) Case id
(ii) Name of litigant (taxpayer)
(iii) Date of the Council session that decided the case
(iv) Rapporteur name
(v) Decision id
(vi) Text of the decision
(vii) Summary of the decision (usually contains the text of the decision and specifies
the taxes discussed).

In the next stage, we undertook the data cleaning, eliminating duplicate results
and those without any information. After that, we obtained all the other variables
(main taxes, final result, type of decision, etc.) by searching for keywords and regular
expressions in the decisions’ summary and text. Finally, we filtered the data on the
population in the study, retaining decisions that were specified without ambiguity,
and occurred between 1999 and 2011. The final database contains 69,865 decisions.

5.2 Descriptive Statistics and Dynamic Assumptions

The dynamic we suggest in section 4.2 can be observed in descriptive statistics.
Figure 2, depicting the fraction of winning plaintiffs each year and quarter and
the volume of new cases in the next period, shows a relation between these two

17 Brazilian currency. This amount is worth around U.S. $430,000. 18 However, as noted previously, part of the literature claims that any proportion is
possible, and the value 0.50 should be observed only when the variance of the subjective
evaluations of the quality of cases goes to zero.

variables. The calculated correlation coefficient for these two variables is 43.21%
(p = 0.025).
As the number of cases in the study is high, we consider many levels of the
explanatory variables:

(i) carf : the explanatory variable of interest. It indicates whether the case was
judged in 2009, i.e., whether it considers CARF changes.
(ii) main tax: the tax issue under discussion, either referring to only one tax or
to a frequently litigated group of taxes, among the following options: IRPF;
PIS; IRF; CSL; ITR; COFINS; FINSOCIAL; IPI; IRPJ; SIMPLES; PIS and
COFINS; CSL and IRPJ; IPI and IRPF; IPI and ITR; PIS, COFINS, CSL and
IRPJ; and other combinations that correspond to few observations.
(iii) year: year of the decision.
(iv) Original state or region: indicates the state (27 levels) or region (5 levels) of
the first level instance of the case.

Table 1 shows the proportion of cases favoring taxpayers grouped by the tax under
discussion.
We can test whether this equilibrium mechanism operates recurring to some
conjectures. For example, we expect that if plaintiffs learn from previous decisions,
a more rational litigant would follow more closely the 50% line, especially when the
prospects for the case are low. If we could separate these more sophisticated litigants
from the pool of litigants, we would expect that they would be closer to the 50%

in the years where litigants are favored. A possible guess is that limited-liability
companies could target these sophisticated litigants (leaving for the other group
public companies, nonprofit organizations, personal litigants, etc.), so we would
expect an asymmetric pattern for the winning rate. Figure 3 depicts these ratios for

limited-liability companies, and we do see such an asymmetric pattern, with the
ratio closer to the 50% line when it is below 50% and further from the 50% line
when it is above 50%.

6 Results and Discussion

Table 2 shows that CARF dummy is strongly associated with a reduction in the
proportion of decisions favoring plaintiffs, a reduction approximately 10% in our
three preferred specifications. In addition to the dummy variable trying to capture
the effect of the creation of CARF, the first column has a year trend and controls
for those situations where the taxpayer decided to appeal (so the taxpayer is the
plaintiff). In all specifications we control for the main tax under discussion (see
in Table 1 how the winning proportion varies strongly with this variable), and for
the sake of brevity we present a χ2 statistic of joint significance for the estimated
coefficients.
Figure 1 supports our empirical strategy, as we can see plaintiffs’ winning fraction
constantly approaching the fifty–fifty proportion equilibrium, evolving around 50%
in a sinusoidal pattern. The intense regulatory activity of tax authorities, aimed at
increasing the government’s gains in those discussions, constantly displaces this

equilibrium toward a pro-government legal standard. We also note that most of the
time this ratio stands slightly below 50%, which is compatible with two caveats
urged by the asymmetric-information literature.
First, tax authorities have a larger stake in those cases, as precedents could
undermine their strategy to increase tax revenues. The government here would avoid
litigation, on the one hand bringing only strong cases to CARF, and on the other
hand working on legislative changes to strengthen its position. This also explains
why the time trend is negative and significant in all specifications in Table 2. Our
suggestion, to be further tested, is that the annual reduction of approximately 2.5%

in the chances plaintiffs have of winning flow from this legislative strategy employed
by the tax authorities.
The second explanation for the slight departure from the 50% rule is the difference
in variance when parties are assessing the quality of cases. Figure 3 shows how less
sophisticated parties, which would experience difficulty in attempting to assess this
quality, have a lower winning fraction (performance of LLC companies compared
with other litigants). Limited-liability companies are a very popular organizational
form in the country, usually chosen by small businesses. On the other hand, public
companies are usually more sophisticated, as are natural persons who decide to
bring their litigations to the CARF.19 We can see from the graph how the winning
fraction is far lower for LLCs.
Finally, while our empirical strategy seems to work as a test of the direction of
the effects, the degree to which the same strategy could show the magnitude of
those effects is less certain. To have an estimate of this magnitude we need to have
a better understanding of the dynamics of the Priest–Klein filter to estimate how
long it takes the selection to fully operate. We think this subject warrants attention
and further development in future research.

19 A natural person who decides to litigate at CARF is usually a very wealthy person,
and most of the time is discussing income taxes. Limited-liability companies in
most cases are facing credit constraints and may resort to such appeals, which may
be fairly expensive because of the interest charged by tax authorities, just to postpone
taxes. They are usually very small companies.
