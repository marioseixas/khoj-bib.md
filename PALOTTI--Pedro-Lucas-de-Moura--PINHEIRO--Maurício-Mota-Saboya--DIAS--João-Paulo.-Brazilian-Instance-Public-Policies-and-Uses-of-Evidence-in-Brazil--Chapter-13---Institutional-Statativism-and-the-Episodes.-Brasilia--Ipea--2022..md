INSTITUTIONAL STATATIVISM AND THE EPISODES AROUND THE

CAUSES OF BRAZILIAN JUDGEMENT OF FIRST INSTANCE1

“[We] at the CNJ, President Gilmar Mendes, the councilors, we all know that
we are living in a country of extreme, profound, unjust and hateful social
inequality. And inequalities are also included in the scope of the Judiciary!”
(CNJ, 2008a), exclaimed the then minister Gilson Dipp, national inspector of
the CNJ, at the II National Meeting of the Judiciary, in February 2009. But the
minister's speech, as it might seem, did not refer to the inequalities in accessing
the Justice. He referred to structural inequalities within the judiciary, to
“inequalities between instances”, to inequalities between “inflated courts” and
“abandoned first-degree justice”: “Brazilian justice is as unequal as inequality
between people” ( op. cit.), in a tone of denunciation, concluded the minister.
The body that would centralize the coordination of the administrative and
financial organization of the Brazilian Judiciary (the CNJ) had already been in
existence for a little over four years, and, as if in a discursive coalition, it seems
that the theses about the causes of the slowness of Justice, in the speeches
given at the event: “Although they differ in terms of competences, the Brazilian
judicial bodies form a single Judiciary, hence it is commonly said that the
Judiciary is a national power, whose image is immediately affected if the shortest of the rods weakens” (CNJ,

The first degree of jurisdiction is the gateway to
Justice. It is the front line, the vanguard of the
Judiciary. It is, in most cases, the only point of contact
between the citizen and the Judiciary. It is where the
service of Justice is visualized, felt, dreamed and
achieved. It is the face of Justice that is perpetuated
in the imagination of the thousands of men and
women who seek help every year. (...). There is a
pressing need to give a new perspective to the first
degree. It is necessary to direct our eyes and attention to the gateway to Justice4

2008b), declared the then president of the CNJ, Minister Gilmar Mendes. It was
also a denunciation discourse: “just as in a well-organized machine, if a part does
not work, no matter how small, it is the whole that is harmed” (op. cit.).

Six days before the aforementioned Second National Meeting of the Judiciary
Power, where the first Strategic Planning of the Judiciary Power would be approved,
President Gilmar Mendes arrived, to add to the statistical evidence of the Justice in
Numbers report, the recent statistical results of the 1st Survey on the Working
Conditions of Judges, carried out by the Association of Brazilian Magistrates (AMB),
in the pioneer presidency of a magistrate of first instance of the Northeast region,
Judge Airton Mozart Valadares Pires, of the Court of Justice of the State of
Pernambuco ( TJPE). In the report, the conclusion was that “the working conditions
of magistrates reveal[ed] a worrying situation and help[ed] to understand the delay
demanded by the citizen when resorting to Justice” (AMB, 2009, p. 4-5): the
“number of judges in Brazil is insufficient for the number of cases”; “only 15% of the
units process up to a thousand processes – a number considered acceptable”. “In
addition to the insufficient number of judges, the survey reveals that the number of
technical personnel is practically half of what would be needed to meet the demands
of the Judiciary”; we have “lack of transparency in the way the resources of the
Judiciary are managed”; “almost [the] totality of magistrates are unaware of the
percentage of the Court's budget that is transferred to their unit”; and “more than
two thirds of the judges say that the allocated resources are insufficient” (op. cit.).

Highlighting one of the most impressive statistics from the latest Justice in Numbers
report , created by statisticians from the Department of Judicial Research (DPJ),
the president also highlights:

This investigation proposes to highlight how statistical ecology was central to
support a wave of intra-bureaucratic protests against structural inequalities between
instances of the Brazilian judiciary. The work carried out here explores how the
actors and defenders of the magistracy of first instance in Brazil mobilized statistics
to try to reach historical claims of this class, located in different episodes, since the
installation of the CNJ, in 2005, such as, among others: i) the search for the
standardization of objective criteria in the career movement of the judiciary; ii) the
right to vote in choosing the

it matters little whether the congestion charge of a certain court is regular, or
appears to be regular, if cases accumulate in the districts. (...) Many times,
exactly this can happen: a given court may be giving the adequate answer in
the second degree, precisely because the first degree has a high rate of
congestion. [Therefore, there has to be] balance in the working conditions
offered to the instances in order to prove adequate to the demands that pass
through them, there needs to be an adequate distribution of resources between
the second and first grades (CNJ, 2008b).

As follows, after this introduction, section 2 brings the theoretical inspirations
and proposed arguments; section 3 centralizes the proposed episodes; and, finally,
section 4 presents the final considerations.

direction of the courts; and iii) the construction of a distributive policy to subsidize

improvements in the working conditions of the basic judiciary.

“Statistical institutions [treat] people as members of abstract groups rather than
individuals with unique identities, histories and motivations”, situates Haggerty
(2001, p. 100) as this statement being one of the most central criticisms made of
the State when using of quantification. After all, agrees Bourdieu (2014, p. 38), “it
is not [only] an instrument that allows measuring, that allows those who govern to
know the governed”, it is an instrument of symbolic construction of the State,
especially in the construction principles of division, of production of legitimate social
identities. “It is not by chance that there is a link between the State and statistics”,
refers Bourdieu (2014, p. 38).

To help with this research proposal, we dialogue with the conceptual proposal
of Bruno, Didier and Vitale (2014), who argue that activism with statistics, which
they call stativism, is a repertoire of action of social movements in contentious
episodes for the search for representation and affirmation of the reality they
experience, as well as to support criticism and denunciations of this reality. With
inspiration from Abers' (2017) concept of institutional activism, we propose to
characterize the episodes surrounding the causes of first-degree judiciary as
institutional stativism, an activist movement with statistics by actors from the
institutions themselves. From this, we seek to identify what we call statistics
mobilization practices, a term referring to the construction of meanings with
statistical principles, techniques and results to support and justify political causes.
The methodology followed privileges the consultation of official and institutional
sources, produced by social, professional and institutional actors, involved in the
episodes surrounding the claims of the first instance judiciary in Brazil, whose data
and analyzes were processed in the Atlas.ti software .

In this role of categorical production, what we discuss is that “statistics are
frequently contested” and that “certain movements denounce them, accusing
quantification of freezing human relations; of transmitting a cold image of society;
of constantly evaluating human beings, citizens, workers”, as identified by Bruno,
Didier and Vitale (2014, p. 199).

5. Body created by Constitutional Amendment (EC) 45/2004 , with the mission of coordinating the administrative and financial
management of the Brazilian courts.

However, in the context of expectations leading to the creation of the
CNJ,5 a statistics mobilization movement was born with a different approach
from traditional denunciation movements and which has been institutionalized
over the years, coming from internal and external voices of/in support of first
instance judiciary in Brazil. The former general secretary and then advisor to
the CNJ, judge Rubens Curado Silveira, representative of the first instance
judiciary of the Labor Court, in an opinion published on the famous website
Consultor Jurídica (ConJur), in August 2015, came to warn of the serious
situations of inequalities experienced within the Judiciary. Specifically, he described:

These denouncing excerpts from judge Rubens Curado accompanied his
defense of the National Policy for Priority Attention to the First Degree of
Jurisdiction, which had recently been launched by the CNJ (in 2014). The
magistrate's protest was based on statistics published by the Justice in Numbers
report, which were mobilized in several episodes of contestation over the
working conditions under which the first instance judiciary in Brazil is historically
subjected, and is a demonstration that shows that “ there are also emerging
forms of collective action that use numbers, measures and indicators as means
of denunciation and criticism. In certain cases, activists use statistics as a tool
for struggle and as a means of emancipation” (Bruno, Didier and Vitale, 2014,
p. 199). After all, this is a “form of statistical politics that involves (...) trying
rhetorically to 'do things' with numbers, with statistics being used as a persuasive
device to advance political causes” (Haggerty,

The burden on the shoulders of servers in the first instance is equally greater:
488 cases against 227 in the second instance. (...) by itself, it reveals the
imbalance in the distribution of the workforce. That is to say: there are many
servers where there are few processes and, proportionally, few servers where
almost all processes are concentrated. This accumulation of collection can be
explained, to a large extent, by the poor historical structure of the first instance,
represented by counties and jurisdictional units lacking the minimum resources
to meet the procedural demand. In contrast, the concentration of investments at
the top of the courts is visible. As a result of a cultural inversion of priorities,
sumptuous headquarters crowded with public servants share the scene with
hovels crammed with processes (Silveira, 2015).

Data from the Judiciary show an alarming workload on the first instance, which
translates into society in the form of procedural delays. Suffice it to say that 95%
of pending cases (stock) are in the first grade, responsible for a congestion rate
of 77%, 30 percentage points higher than the second grade (47%). The workload
of first-degree magistrates is, astonishingly, 6,383 cases per judge, double that
imposed on second-degree judges.

2001, p. 95). “Statistics are situated in broader discourses where they can be
invoked to advance an agenda” (op. cit., p. 95). And that is a form of activism.
More specifically, it is stativism.

(Bruno, Didier and Vitale, 2014, p. 199). Traditionally used by the workers'
movement, as stated by Bruno, Didier and Vitale (2014), stativism is moving to
many fields of action and by many types of actors, and is present, mainly, in terms
of state restructuring. In this action repertoire, there are two roles that the actors
grant to statistics: representation of reality and criticism of reality. Therefore,
Bruno, Didier and Vitale (2014) propose that, in the production of a shared reading
of reality, we can find two dimensions of stativism: denunciation and affirmation.
“In other words, we will see the role of stativists in denouncing a certain state of
reality and, also, in efforts to use statistics in creating equivalence between
disparate conditions and in cementing emerging social categories” (op. cit., p .
198 ).

In the case of the episodes that will be narrated here, a coalition in defense of
the claims of the magistracy of first instance in Brazil mobilized official statistics,
in particular to try to advance causes in denunciation of budgetary and personnel
distributive practices, criteria and practices in the movement of careers and the
election system for the administrative tops of the courts in the country.

But, unlike what Bruno, Didier and Vitale (2014) propose to focus on,
situating the mobilization of statistics in contentious causes as part of a broad
repertoire of action by social movements, we propose to show that this tativism
is also a repertoire of action by social movements . intrabureaucracy, a kind of
action repertoire that we suggest conceptualizing as institutional stativism.

Bruno, Didier and Vitale (2014) draw attention to the urgency of “recognizing
how much social movements use statistics and quantification as part of

This last term is inspired by the conceptual proposal of institutional activism6

Bruno, Didier and Vitale (2014) propose that stativism, a term formed by the
contraction of statistics and activism, is a particular form of action in a wide
repertoire used by contemporary social movements (the mobilization of statistics);
“it should be understood perhaps as a slogan to be brandished in battle, but also
a term to be used in the description of those experiments aimed at reappropriating
the power of statistics of denunciation and emancipation”

by Abers (2017) – a proactive action that involves the search for opportunities by
the state bureaucracy, the object of this action being the defense of a contentious
cause, “even when it is opposed to the demands of its superiors” (op. cit. , p . 26).

6. We recognize that we were inspired in an ultra-adapted way by the concept of institutional activism proposed by Abers
(2017), which situates activism in the relations of bureaucracy with social causes. However, we dare to propose that the
concept helps us to think about repertoires of action in causes that we deem contentious within intra-bureaucratic relations,
a conceptual journey that, we agree, requires refinements and justifications to the debate proposed in this chapter.

Institutional Stativism and the Episodes around the Causes of the
Brazilian Magistracy of First Instance

Additionally, we also propose to show that, sometimes, statistics are
mobilized to simultaneously criticize and represent, to denounce and

their repertoires of action, in the criticism of certain statistics, as well as in the
use of others as powerful instruments in political struggles” (op. cit., p. 202).
Stativism, the authors suggest, “designates those statistical practices that are
used to criticize and free from any authority”, but they also agree that
quantification, sometimes, plays a crucial role in the construction of authority, of
domination: “we could also to say that today there is hardly a better example of
authority capable of disarming any criticism than a number or nexuses of
numbers” (op. cit., p. 200). An important distinction that these authors bring is
that statistics is about representing – synthetically – reality and stativism is about
challenging the representation of reality with statistics themselves. Thus, in order
to advance in this instrumental recognition that make statistics these movements,
and that also applies to the nature of the movement with which we propose to
analyze in this chapter, we agree that an important aspect to be investigated
concerns the practices of mobilization of statistics that , as well as the purposes
for which they are mobilized, can help in understanding how this form of activism
develops.

The examples of contentious episodes, around the causes of the magistracy
of first instance in Brazil, which we will report in section 3, allow us to situate the
practices of mobilization of statistics referring to the construction of systems of
meanings with the elements of statistical ecology, such as principles, techniques,
formulas and results, among other dimensions, to support, justify and represent
political causes. On the battlefield, sometimes the mobilization of statistics occurs
in reaction to criteria that have been established; “in other cases, stativism is not
against indicators, but consists of quantifying data to make an issue visible and
relevant” (Bruno, Didier and Vitale, 2014, p. 200). On this aspect, Nas cimento
and Abers (2020) also show that, depending on where the actors are located in
the intra-bureaucratic political dispute, different statistics mobilization strategies
can be observed: actors producing statistics can mobilize statistical techniques
whose resulting indicators are constituted in order to induce organizational
changes, by classifying better and worse. Otherwise, the actors affected by such
classification techniques – in particular, those who reach low positions in indices
and indicators –, to mitigate socio-institutional losses, create and disseminate
new interpretations, “sometimes abandoning, sometimes recombining some (...)
elements [constituting the statistics], to propose positive interpretative trails of
themselves” (op. cit., p. 138), which is the case they bring from the creation of
the controversial Comparative Productivity Index of Justice (IPC-Jus), by the
DPJ /CNJ, to assess the comparative productive efficiency of Brazilian courts.

claim. In the episodes that will be discussed around the causes of first instance

judiciary in Brazil, this simultaneous practice will be explained.

“This is a historic date for the Brazilian judiciary”, highlights the commemoration of

the president of the AMB, judge Rodrigo Collaço, on the Migalhas website (CNJ

welcome..., 2005). The commemoration was related to the reception of the request

for measures submitted by the AMB to the CNJ, which claimed that the vote in the

promotions by merit of judges from the first degree to the second degree should be
open and reasoned. “It is the recognition of the importance of merit, the introduction
of constitutional principles, such as transparency, impersonality and publicity in
promotion based on merit. This will contribute to the appreciation of the judge before
society” (op.cit .), stated the judge, situating the meaning of his commemoration.

Another claim that accompanied the open and reasoned practice of voting for

ascension to the second degree was the observance of the courts to what the

Organic Law of the National Judiciary (Loman) already provided for in terms of

promotion: the regulation by the courts of the verification and assessment of the promotion criteria.

In the application submitted to the CNJ, the AMB argued that Constitutional

Amendment 45/20047 – which brought changes known as the reform of the Judiciary,

among which it created the CNJ – established “four objective criteria for the purpose

of assessing the merit of judges, aiming at the promotion in the career”,8 and the

demand was that “the immediate observance of these parameters was necessary,

through an open and reasoned vote, by all national courts, in the acts of promotion

of magistrates”. The open and reasoned practice of voting was so important for

compliance with the adoption of objective criteria in the promotion process because

“until the moment that preceded EC 45/2004 , promotions based on merit were

made, in the national courts, through secret ballot, in which the magistrates on the

list did not have access to the motivation for promotion”; therefore, “the subjective

criterion prevailed over the objective”, denounces the AMB.

10. This defense of the quantification of criteria must be read in the historical context of the demands of the
Brazilian judiciary, led by judiciary associations, such as the AMB. For several decades now, the excessive
quantification and production of statistical indicators has been questioned, especially when its promoters forget
to answer the question: what are data for? Gauléjac (2005) even calls it “quantyphrenia”. For more details of
this discussion in other scientific areas, see, among other authors, Desrosières (2010), de Gauléjac (2005),
Koga (2003) or Roy and Offredi (2011).

Citing excerpts from Loman,9 the request for measures highlighted that, for the purpose

of composing a triple list,

The complaint was about the validity of objective investigations, when available,

without due regulation by the court. According to AMB's claim and complaint, in relation to

Loman's enrollment: “As can be seen, such criteria could only be considered effectively

objective in the face of any 'regulation issued by the court', because, if they were

considered as such in law, would not meet the legal requirement”.

This is a case in which the mobilization of statistics can be observed to defend that

the objectification of criteria is the only practice that represents the fair structuring of the

rationale for moving the career of the judiciary.

of the criteria teaches us that actors can direct statistical elements and quantification as

the only valid means of representing reality, including to dilute the autonomy of more

powerful actors that, otherwise, under another type of industriousness, would not be

possible. In this episode, statistics represent and guarantee more rights than any other

type of operationalization.10

The AMB further adds that: It

is necessary for each court to discipline, at least, (a) what the judge's conduct is
(...), (b) what are the parameters in order to be able to quantify the industriousness
in the exercise of the position, and (d) the valuation to be attributed to each
improvement course. (...) [The] courts have never observed these criteria (...)
promotions always take place by means of a mere secret ballot (...). A given judge
received fewer votes than another without knowing which objective requirements
the winner would have fulfilled to the detriment of his requirements.

The claim for parameterization, for valuation, for quantified industriousness

EC no. 45/2004 also legislated on the matter, specifying that promotion should take

place by “measuring merit according to performance and objective criteria of productivity

and promptness in the exercise of jurisdiction and

merit will be determined at the entrance and assessed with the prevalence of
objective criteria, in the form of the regulations issued by the Court of Justice,
taking into account the conduct of the judge, his industriousness in carrying out
his position, the number of times he has appeared in the list, (...) as well as the
use in improvement courses.

But it was also not enough to resort to the CNJ to remind the courts about the

constitutional observance of openness and the objective justification of the vote; the

experience was still not ideal, especially in terms of grounds. The denunciations

continued, such as those of the then president of the AMB, Judge Mozart Valadares, in

defense of the draft of the new resolution proposed by the Commission on Prerogatives

in the Career of Magistracy, created during the administration of Minister Gilmar Mendes:

“The vast majority of judges treat the public space as if it were private”: “To be promoted

to the TJPE, the candidate must make a pilgrimage through the judges’ office, assuming

commitments that this collegiate does not waive”. “So you get there without

independence” (Magalhães, 2008), “deserving is not falling to the one who works the

hardest. If the magistrate knows that the work is not enough to get the promotion, the

result is discouragement” (AMB, 2010). The new resolution, which was open for public

consultation, and which would replace Resolution 6/2005 , regulated more specifically on

the parameterization and operationalization of the objectivity of the criteria for

for the attendance and success in official or recognized improvement courses”, he adds

in his request for measures to AMB. The petition motivated the proposal of one of the

CNJ's first resolutions, Resolution no. 6, of September 2005, which resolved on the

“measurement of merit for the promotion of magistrates and access to second-degree

courts”, guaranteeing, in art. 1st

In the words of the author of the original proposal, minister Ives Gandra, on the

Miga lhas website , “the idea is to provide more objectivity to the promotion of magistrates,

avoiding political criteria and standardizing the rules in the courts” (CNJ analyses..., 2010) .

, that

“promotions based on merit of magistrates will be carried out in a public session, in a

nominal, open and reasoned vote” (CNJ, 2005). Furthermore, it resolved that the courts

should issue normative acts regulating the objective assessment of the criteria provided

for by EC no. 45/2004.

Instead of drawing attention to the only valid way of constructing the basis of

the vote for career advancement, it was time to point out the specificities of the

elements of objectification, parameterization and quantification of the laboriousness

of the measurement. The movement of representation of the judiciary was still

around the quantitative assessment of those who work the most. The new resolution
valued the criteria, in addition to specifying the operationalization of some variables,
such as the variables belonging to the evaluation of productivity and the evaluation
of promptness. Measures such as mean, median, standard deviation and indices
were suggested for normalization. However, as can be seen in Table 1, the norm
brought a hybrid operationalization of the criteria, which was the reason for the
controversies that arose around the new resolution proposal. Despite the new
standardization establishing the maximum quantitative score of the criteria that
compose the assessment by merit, even the criteria for evaluating productivity and
evaluating readiness, it was not specifically established in part of its variables how
much and how to quantify. In addition, the new norm added new criteria that were
difficult to measure quantitatively, such as the assessment of the quality of decisions
and the assessment of the adequacy of conduct to the Code of Ethics of the
National Judiciary. The hybridity and plasticity of some criteria leave room for
different approaches, particularly by the evaluator, but it also interferes with the way
in which the evaluated person defines the course of his professional performance,
as can be seen in studies on the issue (Dias, 2004) .

The new norm generated many contrary repercussions by associations of the

judiciary; in particular, the AMB, the Association of Federal Judges of Brazil (Ajufe)

and the National Association of Labor Justice Magistrates (Anamatra), claiming that,
with Resolution 106/2010, in fact, the proponents “ended up establishing subjective
criteria and still violate the principles of independence of judges, isonomy and
proportionality” (STF, 2010), argued the associations in the Direct Action of
Unconstitutionality (ADI) No. 4,510, filed at the STF . Previously, the associations
had submitted a request for measures to the CNJ, denouncing that many provisions
of Resolution 106/2010 lacked constitutional support, such as the new criteria for
measurement, in addition to the risk of subjectivity they entailed in the evaluation.
However, this is the resolution that still applies today.

The date of March 31, 2014 marked the apex of what became known as the Direct

Elections Movement in the Brazilian Courts. On that day, male and female judges

from all over the country, coordinated by the national and local professional

associations of the judiciary, filed requests asking for changes in the internal regulations of their

Continuing the defense for democratization in the Brazilian courts, the
then president of the AMB, the judge of the first degree of the Court of Justice
of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (TJRGS), João Ricardo dos Santos Costa,
explained that the date of March 31, 2014 was not random to proclaim the

to vote to choose the presidency and vice-presidency of the courts (Diretas
Já..., 2014). It was also an old claim that came from more remote times and
that gained strength with the arrival of members of the first degree judiciary in
the presidency of associations (Magalhães, 2008): “There is no internal
democracy in the Judiciary (...)” , “(...) first degree judges are members of the
Judiciary and have to participate in the administration of this power”, “We want
a more accessible Judiciary, made to serve the population and not judges,
judges and ministers”, “ We want good working conditions, functional buildings
and not luxury” (op.cit .), denounced and claimed, at the time of his presidency
of the AMB, the judge of the first degree from Pernambuco, Mozart Valadares.

[Therefore] from the moment the choice process also has to pass
through the expression of will of the judges of first instance, there will
be, in principle, a tendency to make an administration also focused on
the first instance (AMB , 2014, p. 2).

to show that, 50 years after the military coup of 1964, 'the Judiciary has not yet reached

democracy in its fullness',(...) only judges, who represent 17% of magistrates throughout

the country, can vote” (Diretas Already..., 2014).

In fact, the opening of elections for the entire Judiciary "will enable a better

qualification of the Judiciary and the improvement of our jurisdictional performance"

The point is that

it is not just a matter of democratizing the administrative structure of the Judiciary,
but mainly of allowing the choice of that magistrate who, for the majority of
members of the judiciary, presents himself as the best manager, the best
administrator of public affairs. , (...) while the process of choosing management
positions is restricted to the electoral college formed by magistrates who are part
of the second instance, the administration of the first instance will be relegated to
the particular will of the elected magistrate (...) by the members exclusively of the second instance.

“After all, it is not credible that only 17% of the judiciary is allowed to define the

destinations of the Judiciary” (AMB, 2014, p. 9), claimed the president of the AMB, in

the request for measures to the CNJ, filed on April 8 of 2014, as a national symbol of

the coalition for Diretas Já in the Brazilian courts, requesting that the council issue a

“recommendation to all courts of Justice for them to change their internal regulations,

aiming to expand the college of voters in order to reach all magistrates linked to the

courts, in the process of choosing presidents and vice presidents” (op. cit., p. 10).

(Santos and Romão, 2014), published on the website of the Order of Lawyers of Brazil

(OAB), regional of Ceará, a second degree magistrate of the Court of Justice of the

State of Ceará (TJCE) in favor of the cause. According to Santos and Romão (2014):

“several Brazilian courts abandon the first instance, granting good working conditions

only to the second level; and this is nothing more than a reflection of the electoral

process for the administration of the court”, therefore, “through a direct election, the

monocratic judges will be able to charge the elected judges, demanding a management

focused on the first degree” (op. cit . .). It is not just a cause of the judiciary, “the direct

election reveals a way of inserting democratic management within the scope of the

Judiciary, because democracy enables a leadership committed to the aspirations of

those under jurisdiction and to the results desired by the institution” (op . cit .). Thus,

the magistrate makes the following statement: “No one is better than the first degree

judge to diagnose the needs of the district where his work is to be carried out, due to

his approach to the parties and lawyers” (op. cit. ) .

The struggle comes from the country's pre-democratization period, and it turned out
that the Constitution of [19]88 did not include a full democratization of the three
powers of the Republic and the Judiciary was left pending. We made this request
based on the possibility of the National Council of Justice, as manager of national
policies for the Judiciary, issuing a recommendation, (...) it is a recommendation that
we are proposing, in order for the courts to make progress on this issue of full
participation of the judiciary in the choice of boards of directors (...). I would like to
address this topic here from the perspective of the management of the Brazilian
Justice system: one of the biggest difficulties we have today, perhaps the biggest
problem, maybe not, the biggest problem of the Brazilian Justice system, is
congestion, there are the lengthy services that the Judiciary has provided to Brazilian
society. [In] these ten years of CNJ, we have not yet managed to advance in this
aspect, and we understand that an important step for us to move forward would be to
place these more than 80% of the members of the Judiciary as protagonists in the management of the Justice system (CNJ, 2016a) .

The difficulties we have to face are very visible, in conceiving a national policy on the
basis of the Justice system, where all the demand for justice in the country is received
(...) these difficulties (...) notably occur due to of the verticalized policies that are
conceived by the courts. And this is due to the way in which the representation of the
Brazilian Justice is constituted (CNJ, 2016a).

The movement for direct elections in the courts invokes the old relationship

between statistical principles and democratization. More than 80% of members of
the Judiciary Power without the right to vote for the choice of the direction of the
courts, which is the percentage of members of the national magistracy of first
instance, justifies the criticism that there is no democracy in the Judiciary, that there
is no a system of majority representation, of which the current proportion does not
mean democracy. Only 17% of the members of the judiciary and belonging to
another level of jurisdiction with voting rights was the proportional representation
used by the actors to characterize the organizational government system of the
courts as dictatorships, as indicated by the symbolism of the campaign I want to
vote for president . Direct now in Brazilian courts.

And the day of voting arrived for granting or not the request for measures
submitted by the AMB, specifically at the 238th Ordinary Session of the CNJ, which
took place on September 28, 2016. Although, in the documented request, submitted
in 2014, there was no mobilization of statistics to support the arguments for the
democratization of the state courts, it was left to the crucial moment of the plenary
sessions of the council, which is the oral support of the interested party. In defense
of the claim, the presiding judge of the AMB, Ricardo Costa, reminds the plenary that this

The correlation between the non-election participation of almost 80% of
members of the Brazilian Judiciary and the problems of the Judiciary was close, in
the view of the claimants.

Judiciary (...) cannot remain immune, insensitive, to democratic activity; and
democratic activity, it involves precisely the participation of first degree
judges in court decisions (CNJ, 2016a).

The subject addressed today is of extreme importance for the judiciary. It is
extremely important for the judiciary because we, first class magistrates,
are, for the most part, so I don't generalize, excluded from the decisions of
the courts to which we belong. (...) There is, in fact, in Brazil, a mismatch
between the first-degree judiciary and the second-degree judiciary. While
the offices of first degree judges have a maximum of two advisors, the
offices of judges have at least eighteen advisors (...). There are situations of
courts in Brazil that, despite having only 4% of the cases being processed
in the state, have 26% of the employees allocated to the state Judiciary.
This is a situation that we know is directly reflected in the issue of democratization, [and the]

In comparison to the way in which the system of participation in other powers

is developed, emphasizes the magistrate, president of Ajufe, Roberto Carvalho

This correlation built by the actors exposes the administrative management

representation crisis that exists in the Brazilian courts. Still in the view of the judge

president of the AMB, “we have made a lot of progress in relation to this, but in many

courts we still practice the seniority criterion. So, today, the manager waits his turn,

he does not commit to a project, (...) and he is not accountable after he leaves” (CNJ,
2016a). In this excerpt, there is another denunciation of the system for establishing
administrative leadership – and representation – in the courts, which is the existence
of the seniority rule for candidates running for president. For reasons of this electoral
structure, the president of the AMB denounces, “the members of Power do not know
what will be carried out, the commitments they have, (...) there is already a problem
of legitimation and a serious problem in representation, which is something expensive
in democracy. This, in the scope of management, has quite evident consequences” (op.
cit.). It is “about valuing that sector [in] which all demands for justice are involved
and [in] which almost, much more than half, almost 90% of disputes are at the basis
of the Justice system, and this basis is found become precarious in view of the way
the courts have been managed” (op. cit.), he sustains.

There is another dimension of representation constructed by the actors when

they demand appreciation via the right to vote in that sector in which all the demand
for justice comes into play: not representing the base judiciary means not also
representing those under jurisdiction, society. This non-representation is supported,
in the actors' view, by the proportion of structural working conditions between the
instances, a dimension centrally brought up in oral arguments by the president of
Ajufe, judge Roberto Carvalho Veloso, in support of the AMB:

Veloso, in his oral argument,

Another aspect that draws attention is the strategy of the actors in invoking
a system of terms that help to frame the meaning of the proportionality of
disputes and the number of judges in the composition of the instances, in order
to give rhetorical force to the claim for voting. Mobilized terms, such as the basis
of the system, gateway, population, Diretas Já, representation, participation and
manifestation of the [popular] will, approached the first degree judiciary as being
compared to the people, society, the voter – a statist movement which proposed
the meaning of the first instance as not being the lowest, but the most crucial for
the Justice system, a meaning that had great repercussions in the construction
of the National Policy of Priority Attention to the First Degree of Jurisdiction of
the CNJ.

The fight continued even though the CNJ plenary rejected the request of the
AMB for the issuance of a recommendation to the courts for the inclusion of the
magistracy of first instance in the electoral process. In times of projection of what
would become known as the apex of the movement of associations for the
democratization of the administrative structures of the Judiciary, another
mobilization around the cause was also born from within the CNJ, in the
construction of a judicial institutional public policy that would try to change the
course of the meaning of first instance justice in the organizational structure of the justice system:

This was an enthusiastic announcement, at the Preparatory Meeting for the
7th National Meeting of the Judiciary, by the counselor representing the first
degree magistracy of Labor Justice, Judge Rubens Curado Silveira, one of the
central actors in the idealization of this policy and coordinator of the group of
work instituted by CNJ Ordinance No. 155, of September 6, 2013 (CNJ, 2013a).
“And what made the National Council, especially the president, propose this
working group, as a sign of a permanent national policy aimed at

Even the Executive, the executives, mainly the municipal executives, who are
elected by direct vote of the people, today, adopted the measure of the
participatory budget, in which the population is heard in advance (...). Why
can't we do this in the Judiciary too? And the path is the participation of first
degree magistrates in the election of the board of directors (CNJ, 2016a).

Yesterday we also received, with great joy, the constitution of this working
group, (...) something innovative on the part of Minister Joaquim Barbosa, of a
group to present to him, to the National Council of Justice, (...) proposals that
will consolidate and implement a future, but already launched, policy of
prioritizing the first level of jurisdiction (CNJ, 2013b).

3.3 Episode 3: “Suffice it to say, I will not dwell on numbers, that
90% of cases in Brazil are at the first level of jurisdiction” (CNJ,
2013b): The National Policy of Priority Attention to the First Level of Jurisdiction

Machine Translated by Google
Institutional Stativism and the Episodes around the Causes of the
Brazilian Magistracy of First Instance

According to data from the Justice in Numbers report, 90% of the cases being
processed by the Judiciary are in the first level units, giving rise to an average
congestion rate of 73%, 23 percentage points above the existing rate in the
second level, and the main cause of current systemic slowness; [in addition,] the
data from that same report point, as a rule, to an inadequate distribution of public
servants between the first and second levels of jurisdiction, disproportionate to
the demand for cases (CNJ, 2013a).

Suffice it to say, I won't go into numbers, that 90% of cases in Brazil are in the
first level of jurisdiction (...). A diagnosis that underlies all of our work, and that
jumps to our eyes, in fact, and that is known to all of us, [is that the] (...) great
bottleneck of the Judiciary is in the first degree of jurisdiction (. ..). Of the 89
million lawsuits that were processed in 2011, according to the latest official data
from the [report] Justiça em Números, almost 80.79 million are at the first level
of jurisdiction. (...) And we know, we all know the first degree of jurisdiction, and
we know the difficulties faced (...), which are also portrayed in the congestion
rate, which is more than 50%, on a national average, [ than second degree
(CNJ, 2013b).

In 2013, in the ordinance that established the working group, the presidency of

the CNJ, in the exercise of its attributions, already set the statistical tone that

legitimized the interpretation of this kind of statistical causal chain of the slowness of

Justice to justify the need to create this group , in order to think about the prioritization policy

strategic management work” (CNJ, 2013b), the counselor also justified.

The extracted data referred to those published in the Justice in Numbers report,

whose statistics systematize the comparative results of procedural, budgetary and

personnel demands between the first and second levels of jurisdiction of each

segment of Justice by the CNJ. The report ’s indices and indicators

Under such statistical justifications, the group created had the responsibility of

“developing studies and presenting proposals (...) with a view to the implementation

of a national policy aimed at prioritizing the first level of jurisdiction in the Brazilian

courts”, in particular “with a view to identify the main problems faced by Brazilian

courts” (CNJ, 2013a).

they were the central source of institutional evidence to support the entire argument in
favor of the need to centralize the issue of the structural conditions of the Court of First
Instance, as being a priority in the modernization policies of the Judiciary; in particular,
an indicator that, in the view of the claimants, statistically translated the delay in the
jurisdictional provision and the proportion of the procedural demand to the instances,
at the same time that it represented the structural difficulties faced by the Justice of
first instance (the congestion charge) :

444 | Public Policies and Uses of Evidence in
Brazil: concepts, methods, contexts and practices

According to the Justice in Numbers 2013 report, of the 92.2 million cases
that were processed in the Brazilian Judiciary in 2012, 82.9 million were
in the first degree (...). The data also reveal that the first degree lowered 23.1
million processes, demonstrating that its annual production capacity is only
28% of the demand (new cases plus collection) imposed on its appreciation (...).
Therefore, the first degree congestion rate is 72%, 26 percentage points
above the second degree rate of 46% (CNJ, 2013c, p. 5).

In the report, one conclusion: the productivity of the first instance was
compromised. The solution proposals translated into draft resolutions in the
aforementioned report were named by the working group as being proposals of
the National Policy for Priority Attention to the First Degree of Jurisdiction. In
politics, lines of action were proposed, they were those that represented old
yearnings and claims of the first degree magistracy almost in formulas, among
which: i) equalization of the workforce between the first and second degrees,
proportionally to the demand for Law Suit; ii) budgetary adequacy for the
development of first instance judicial activities; iii) infrastructure and technology;
iv) collaborative governance, favoring internal democracy; and v) social and
institutional dialogue (CNJ, 2013c).

In this more mature episode of the claim of the first degree magistracy, in
which a specific national policy of prioritization was already brought to the
actions of the CNJ, the rate of procedural congestion linked to other statistics
that showed the unequal proportion of structural conditions between instances,
as the proportion of civil servants among them, was central to the mobilization
of evidence by claiming actors to reaffirm, in diagnoses recorded in official
documents, such as technical reports, that, in the view of the institution
responsible for coordinating the modernization policies of the Judiciary, there
was something wrong with the management of resources in the courts: “[The]
first level of jurisdiction is the most overloaded segment of the Judiciary and,
therefore, the one that provides judicial services that fall short of the desired
quality” (CNJ, 2013c, p. 5 ), concluded the report published in December 2013,
containing the studies and proposals carried out by the working group, which
relied, among other institutional actors, on the technical support of the DPJ. But
it wasn't a criticism of the first degree, it was the defense of old causes:

Among the proposed resolutions contained in the report, it was envisaged
to empower the country's judiciary and first-instance officials to manage the
policy, in the institution of the First Degree Prioritization Network: "the courts will
indicate to the presidency of the CNJ, in the within thirty days, two first-degree
magistrates to act as regional policy managers within the scope of their
activities” (CNJ, 2013c, p. 22). It was the proposal for a system of representation
and participation that attempted to dilute the majority system of second-class judiciary.

instance in decision-making on court resources and the unequal allocative
parameters of these resources. In order to seek to guarantee new ways of
allocating resources, two other directives were specifically at the center of another
draft resolution proposed by the working group within the scope of the policy: “The
poor distribution of resources available in the courts, notably among the units of
first and second degrees, is one of the main causes of insufficient performance in
the first instance” (op. cit., p. 25), diagnosed the working group. It was a great
opportunity for the base judiciary to institutionalize the search for equality in
working conditions between instances: “In effect, the working group presents a
proposal to issue a normative act to regulate the equitable distribution of budget,
employees, positions in commission and commissioned functions between the first
and second levels of jurisdiction, respecting the principles of efficiency and
proportionality” (op. cit., p. 25); and to, furthermore, “strengthen the independence
and autonomy of first-degree magistrates” (op. cit., p. 25).

The statistical parameterization project of the actors was aimed at the
democratization of administrative structures. This proposed resolution, to regulate
the matter, also mobilized other statistics used in the Justice in Numbers report,
for the purpose of parameterization and distribution, including:

•

the IPS, “obtained by dividing the total number of processes downloaded
in the previous year by the number

of servers”; the Productivity Index Applied to Warrant Execution Activity

•

(Ipex), “obtained by dividing the total number of warrants executed in
the previous year by the number of employees in the warrant execution

area”; the congestion rate, “an indicator that [measures] the percentage
of cases that were processed during a given base period (new cases
plus pending cases), but that were not downloaded”; It is

The desires for the democratization of the administrative structures of the
courts were embodied by the actors in statistical formulas, which operationalized
the equalization between the instances. The proposed resolution discussed
“identification and proportional distribution of the budget between the first and
second degrees, (...) effective participation of magistrates and civil servants in the
planning and execution of the budget, [and] improvement of the quality of budget
execution” (CNJ, 2013c, p. 26). Specifically, the proposal established the
application of “objective parameters [in] the distribution [and movement] of the
workforce, linked to the demand for processes, with a guarantee of a minimum
structure of the units in the end area” (op. cit. , p . 28); that is, the construction of
distributive parameters was a function of the workload, a function that would favor the most overloaded instance.

Institutional Stativism and the Episodes around the Causes of the Brazilian
Magistracy of First Instance

The public hearing that now begins carries important symbolism. It is symbolic because it is

the first public hearing in the history of the National Council of Justice, the first opportunity in

which the CNJ, for two days, suspends part of its activities to listen to society to be represented

by the main actors of the Justice system, in the certainty that social and inter-institutional

dialogue oxygenates institutions and nurtures democracy. It is also symbolic because it raises

issues of the greatest relevance to Justice and Brazilian society. During these two days of

hearing, we will hear from representatives of prominent public and private institutions that

responded to the CNJ's call to comment on the topics under debate: (...) magistrates, members

of the Public Ministry, public defenders, public and private lawyers, servers and representatives

of the academy (...). First-class efficiency is not a wish, it is not a dream, it is an obligation

(CNJ, 2014b).

It is (...) a moment of great opportunity, a great opportunity to inaugurate a different discourse,

to adapt our Judiciary to the demand for justice of our time. (...) [As already mentioned here,

every demand for It is there that the judge is seen by society. justice that exists in the country

inside forum. It is the forum of the capital. It is the enters through the first degree. It's the
Judiciary that is most frequented by the population (CNJ, 2014b).

proposal of a priority policy brought together many causes around one (that of the first instance

judiciary). The statistical formulations around equity were situated in broader discourses, those

represented by society, convened to give strength to the proposed agenda: the democratization of

court structures, as stated by Minister Joaquim Barbosa, beginning the work:

The president of the Association of Judiciary Servants of Bahia, in support of the policy,

highlights the lack of participation in the courts: “(...) I am delighted with this hearing, as justice

servants will have the right to talk about their problems in their states” (CNJ, 2014b). The general

secretary of the National Federation of Judicial Servants in the States, Volnei Rosalem, in support,

speaks and recalls that the “first degree” is much broader than a body of magistrates; it is “a counter”,

it is the “real world of the Judiciary”, made up of many civil servants, who also give a voice to the

users of Justice: “It is in the first degree that the population approaches the counter and comes into

contact with the Judiciary as a service public. Also [it is] in the first degree [that] the process is still

linked to the real world and real needs” (CNJ, 2014b).

[Here] I am tempted to invoke the poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht, who says the following:

“what times are these when we need to defend the obvious?”. Every time I talk about this

subject, I invoke Brecht (...): it seems so natural that there should be prioritization of the first

degree of jurisdiction, that it even seems counter-intuitive that we are treating this as an

institutional public policy and terms, mainly, to explain what it means! (STM, 2016).

After collecting the contributions and protests, Resolution No. 194, of May 26, 2014, regulates

the institution of the National Policy of Priority Attention to the First Degree of Jurisdiction. But only

in 2016 was the controversial Resolution No. 219, of April 26, which deals with the distribution and

proportional movement of the workforce, approved by the CNJ (CNJ, 2016b). Since then, such are

these resolutions that have been supporting struggles and institutional strategies for greater equality

between instances of the justice system.

most – that is, for new evaluation criteria for the purpose of moving up the career ladder from the

first degree to the second degree –, the

It was obvious because the statistics showed it, according to Carlos Eduardo Oliveira Dias, during

his lecture. But the advisory magistrate’s statement was also the temporal resonance of a

bureaucratic movement of the meaning constructed for those statistics – the new look at the first

instance: “improving the judiciary = improving the first degree” (CNJ, 2015), already disseminated

the advisor Rubens Curado in his presentation at the 1st Meeting of the First Degree Prioritization

Network, in 2014.

4 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

Inspired by the existence of a peculiar action in the battle repertoire in the field of social

movements, which is the mobilization of statistics, and by the fact that the state bureaucracy also

mobilizes to defend internal causes that are dear to them, the objective of this investigation was to

show how statistics were central to support a wave of intramagistracy movements against the

historically existing inequalities between instances. Especially, statistical mobilization practices

(construction of systems of meanings with elements of statistical ecology, such as principles,

techniques, formulas, among other dimensions, to base, justify and represent political causes)

helped us to understand this centrality in different episodes , which marked the movements for the

democratization of the administrative structures of the courts.

claim was around the demand for open voting and based on merit-based promotion processes. In

that episode, statistics were central to preventing, according to claimants, subjective criteria from

prevailing over objective ones and helping to make promotion processes more transparent.

Under a different manifestation, statistical principles were equally central to the construction

of meanings around what became known as the Direct Elections Movement in Brazilian Courts. The

second episode (subsection 3.2) dealt with the causes of the magistracy of first instance for the

democratization of the structures of the courts, a movement that marked the national institutional

struggle of associations of the judiciary for the right to vote for the basic magistracy in the choice of

presidents and vice-presidents. court presidents. In this second episode analyzed, the quantitative

proportionality of magistrates entitled to vote was the statistical practice mobilized to criticize the

fact that only 17% of eligible voters chose the direction of the courts, characterizing the judicial

system as a dictatorship that did not represent the majority of the components of the judiciary. ,

which are more than 80%. In this movement for Diretas Já, the old relationship between statistical

principles and democratization was invoked. In addition, based on this proportion, the actors built

the justification that there is an intimate relationship between the non-electoral participation of the

majority of the judiciary and the existence of problems in the Judiciary, especially since, likewise,

the highest proportion of disputes is in the first instance, the true representatives of society's

aspirations, as they define themselves. Here, there is an example where, at the same time, statistics

are mobilized to criticize and represent the reality experienced by the actors.

Finally, the third episode (subsection 3.3) brought to this debate is marked by the construction

of an institutional policy of prioritizing the first instance around the equitable distribution of budgetary

and personnel resources.

In that episode, statistics were central in the search for improvements in primary school working

conditions, mobilized to make the movement of workforce and budget proportional to the litigation

between instances.

Institutional Stativism and the Episodes around the Causes of the Brazilian
Magistracy of First Instance

The objectification of criteria under claims through the practice of parameterization, valuation and

quantified activity was the only valid means of representing reality, including for the purpose of

diluting the autonomy of more powerful actors, establishing the foundations of their conviction,

which, under another type of industriousness would not be possible.

The construction of statistical formulas that made the base magistrates divide resources according

to new cases that enter the first and second levels was the central practice of mobilizing statistics in

this case. In addition, to reaffirm the importance of the statistical project of distributive allocation of

resources of the courts according to the proportion of litigiousness, the creation of an institutional

field to summon the vision and contribution of different actors to make the project representative

and legitimate through a chain of actors, who

it was the occurrence of a pioneering audience on the subject, it sought to institutionalize the new

perspectives and meanings in the first instance.

Finally, in this chapter, we dare to identify that the central recurrence to principles, instruments

and statistical representations and quantification in episodes of containment in themes of intrabureaucratic
inequalities can be thought of as a form of institutional stativism – that is, a creative

action of institutional actors denouncing the very organizational structure in which they operate with

statistics. A concept that shares with – and invites to – an agenda of debates on the heterogeneity

of the state bureaucracy, as well as on its struggles, causes and inequalities.

Public Policies and Uses of Evidence in Brazil:

concepts, methods, contexts and practices

The reflection presented and the cases exemplified question us about the power of statistics

in the interpretation of reality, in which quantification is far from exercising only the controversial role

of freezing and coldly representing individuals and social relations. Statistics are instruments for

interpreting and reading reality, for battles and fights for the arguments they support, for criticism

and questioning for the results obtained, for reaffirming and building new perspectives on actors

who are disadvantaged in the political game. And not just instruments for the action repertoires of

social movements. In the episodes of intramagistracy struggle in Brazil, it was possible to identify

which principles, techniques and statistical and quantification representations are central to the

construction of meanings that symbolize and base the justification of intrabureaucratic protests

against the inequalities that structure them. Likewise, it was observed that statistics are central to

change and the creation of institutional policies that, in a way, help to dilute such inequalities.
