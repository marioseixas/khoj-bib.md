Judicial Ideology in the House of Lords:
A Jurimetric Analysis

DAVID ROBERTSON*

For a variety of reasons political science in Britain has made no serious
attempt to study courts and judges as political institutions and actors. Or at
least this was true until recently. Several works in the last few years,
especially Griffith's,1 Stevens's2 and a forthcoming book on the law lords by
Alan Paterson,3 have pointed to a much needed change in this attitude.
However, none of them have been works of political science, even though
they have considered politics. By this I mean two things: they have not
principally considered the judges' thoughts as political ideology; and they
have not used the techniques and assumptions of rigorous, analytic political
science. Indeed one of the few slightly earlier studies of the political role of
the courts in Britain, by Morrison,4 specifically denies that such approaches,
especially the statistical approach of jurimetrics, is possible in Britain. This
article is an attempt to do the impossible, not so much because the author
believes that Morrison's point is necessarily wrong, but because it is never
sound methodology to abandon techniques that have been useful elsewhere
without trying to make them work on different data sets. But first we must
attempt to characterize the judicial role, before we try any study of the
politics that may be attendant on judicial ideology.
For political science there are perhaps three broad characterizations of the
judicial role. I will identify these, for convenience, as the realist model, the
class model, and the orthodox model. The realist model comes from the
American tradition in the early decades of this century, best exemplified in
works like Jerome Frank's Law and the Modern Mind and Llewellyn's The
Bramble Bush.6 These assume, broadly, that legal decisions are never
determined in any firm way by the rules, precedents and arguments in the
court. Rather a judge does, and must, come to his decision intuitively, and
then only rationalizes it by the legal material. In itself this says nothing about
the types of decision a judge makes, and not much about how he comes to his
intuitions. It was left to a school of political scientists in the I950S and I96os,
associated with Glendon Schubert,7 to fill in these details.

The class model is broader still as a label, but refers mainly to Marxist
attacks on the law and the courts of 'bourgeois' states. The best recent
example is J. A. G. Griffith's The Politics of the Judiciary.8 He makes two
characteristic claims in this book, although he seldom disentangles them
himself. Primarily he argues that discretionary problems in law are solved by
judges consulting their own notion of 'public interest', which is made up of a
belief that the State must be protected from danger, including 'moral' danger,
that legislation should be limited in its effects on property and other
'bourgeois' freedoms, and that a general political philosophy associated with
the Conservative party should prevail.9 The second assumption that he seems
to make is that judges, in so acting, are acting out of a class-conditioned
perspective, as agents of a dominant socio-economic group. Thus it is not so
much the private and perhaps idiosyncratic intuitions of judges unprovided
with determinate law, but the deliberate and systematic protection of a
particular class that characterizes discretionary judgments.10
One of the class model's major drawbacks is that, by treating judges as
largely interchangeable, it does not enable us to differentiate various profiles
of judicial ideology. If judges are taken as ideologically homogenous, we can
learn nothing in detail about how they do operate, and nothing about the
predisposing - I am hesitant to say causal - elements.
The third, orthodox, model is hard to describe but approximates to the
public lawyer's interpretation of a broadly Austinian theory. It has little of a
systematic nature to say about the uses of discretion. I mean by it the working
assumptions of lawyers and political scientists interested in public law. It
contains perhaps the three following assumptions:

(i) Discretion does exist, because statutes are sometimes vague, or precedents
missing or conflicting.
(2) Most judges most of the time will try very hard to stick within the clear
meaning of the statute or the guidance of precedent. Some will from time
to time try to develop the law to fit modern needs, but this 'public policy
horse' is dangerous, to be ridden seldom and cautiously.
(3) Where 'difficult cases' do crop up, some judges will act from personal
idiosyncrasy, but these are mainly self-cancelling unsystematic quirks, not
representing an intrusion of class ideology, and too limited to fit the
realist model of permanent intuition.
It is difficult, if not impossible, to test any of these models. Not only are
their predictions entirely unclear, but, as a philosopher of science would say,
they use different observation languages. However, they are basically empirical
propositions, and raise questions that need to be answered empirically.

comes from the American realist tradition, under the name of 'judicial
behaviour', and has been carried out principally on the Supreme Courts of the
United States, Canada and Australia.11 Its celebrated paradigm is Schubert's
The Judicial Mind,12 a classic of what has been called 'jurimetrics'. This
involves complex statistical analysis of the voting by Supreme Court judges in
'political' cases during the I950s and I96os. Its principal conclusion, that these
judges can be seen as arrayed on two intercorrelated dimensions, 'political
liberalism' and 'economic liberalism', with several minor dimensions, is well
known. It is often overlooked that Schubert's work is not just descriptive
data-analysis. The data-analysis is informed by, and partially intended as a
test of, a highly specified, if obscure, psychological model of stimulus
perception and choice-making that is influenced by the 'cognitive psychology'
of Coombs.13
The most important criticism of Schubert and his associates is Karl Becker's
Political Behaviouralism and Modern Jurisprudence.14 This stresses the
central importance of the judge's own notion of his role, and especially of the
degree of his commitment to principles like that of stare decisis.15 Becker
argues that although judges may have, or be forced to consult, a private
ideology, and may be influenced by emotional reactions to the facts and
personalities of the case, they are highly trained, and therefore highly
socialized, professionals.16 Come what may, the ideology and the emotions
consulted are those of judges. Although research like Schubert's is very
useful, the dimensions that emerge as characterizing judicial ideology ought,
at least partially, to represent judicial differences on essentially 'professional
judicial' questions.17
However, Schubert's approach is markedly superior to most class analysis,
and certainly to that of Griffith, because it fixes firmly on the judicial
decision. We therefore need to offer, with due caution, an individuating
descriptive account of judicial ideology, on the basis of unambiguous and
standardizable data.
Even the orthodox view invites research of Schubert's type, although not
with his theoretical presuppositions. It accepts that there is discretion on the
margin, and that sometimes it is influenced by judicial prejudice. But it is
silent on how much and how salient and systematic such 'prejudicial' decision

making is. If one can demonstrate that there are fairly fixed and specifiable
dimensions of judicial ideology, operating over a fairly wide field, the
orthodox model may have a certain amount of explaining, and explaining
away, to do.
The data analysis in this article is only exploratory. The whole exercise
is an attempt to see if such an approach may be useful and justified in
general. I give rather more attention therefore to the methodology and its
potential weaknesses than is usual. Indeed, while I hope that the analysis
itself is interesting, the methodology is in some ways the core of this
discussion.
Very broadly, the article attempts to create a statistical model of the
similarities and differences between judicial styles. The model expresses these
similarities in terms of abstract numerical dimensions. These dimensions
have, in themselves, no substantive meaning. Meaning can only be given by a
second stage in the analysis - interpreting these dimensions - which I attempt
by looking at how groups of judges at different ends of these dimensions react
to particular sorts of cases. The third stage is to show how changing
membership of the court has affected the salience of the two primary
dimensions I analyse. At this stage I also look at the relationship between a
judge's position on each of the separate dimensions.
The final part of the article attempts to sketch a more general theory of the
intellectual orientations that might lead judges to occupy varied 'ideological'
positions. I offer some evidence to support the idea that these are orientations
to the very business of being an appellate judge. It should be borne in
mind throughout that my attitude is one of great respect to the judiciary, and
that I end by making the notion of judicial ideology a matter of intellectual
and professional preference, not a psychological drive.

RESEARCH OUTLINE AND METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS

Basic Premises

Judicial decision making in English Appellate Courts is partly discretionary.
My basic premise is that, where discretion exists, an individual judge's voting
will be influenced by his beliefs and attitudes inside a specifically legal and
'professional' ideology. This 'ideology' will vary from judge to judge, and
whether it is conservative or not, will be complicated both by individual
variation with respect to any one aspect of the ideology, and also by the
ideology having several aspects. There is no reason to believe that judges'
views on the separate aspects will be correlated, although they may be. These
ideological variances should in part account for fairly stable groupings of
judges, and should be discoverable, at least in crude form, by analysis of
voting.

making is. If one can demonstrate that there are fairly fixed and specifiable
dimensions of judicial ideology, operating over a fairly wide field, the
orthodox model may have a certain amount of explaining, and explaining
away, to do.
The data analysis in this article is only exploratory. The whole exercise
is an attempt to see if such an approach may be useful and justified in
general. I give rather more attention therefore to the methodology and its
potential weaknesses than is usual. Indeed, while I hope that the analysis
itself is interesting, the methodology is in some ways the core of this
discussion.
Very broadly, the article attempts to create a statistical model of the
similarities and differences between judicial styles. The model expresses these
similarities in terms of abstract numerical dimensions. These dimensions
have, in themselves, no substantive meaning. Meaning can only be given by a
second stage in the analysis - interpreting these dimensions - which I attempt
by looking at how groups of judges at different ends of these dimensions react
to particular sorts of cases. The third stage is to show how changing
membership of the court has affected the salience of the two primary
dimensions I analyse. At this stage I also look at the relationship between a
judge's position on each of the separate dimensions.
The final part of the article attempts to sketch a more general theory of the
intellectual orientations that might lead judges to occupy varied 'ideological'
positions. I offer some evidence to support the idea that these are orientations
to the very business of being an appellate judge. It should be borne in
mind throughout that my attitude is one of great respect to the judiciary, and
that I end by making the notion of judicial ideology a matter of intellectual
and professional preference, not a psychological drive.

RESEARCH OUTLINE AND METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS

Basic Premises

Judicial decision making in English Appellate Courts is partly discretionary.
My basic premise is that, where discretion exists, an individual judge's voting
will be influenced by his beliefs and attitudes inside a specifically legal and
'professional' ideology. This 'ideology' will vary from judge to judge, and
whether it is conservative or not, will be complicated both by individual
variation with respect to any one aspect of the ideology, and also by the
ideology having several aspects. There is no reason to believe that judges'
views on the separate aspects will be correlated, although they may be. These
ideological variances should in part account for fairly stable groupings of
judges, and should be discoverable, at least in crude form, by analysis of
voting.

Judicial Ideology in the House of Lords 5

Selection of Data

Decisions on cases decided by the House of Lords over a twelve-year period
were studied, mainly through statistical analysis. The House of Lords
Appellate Committee was chosen because it is the only English court not
absolutely bound by precedent, and thus the possibility of discretion in
judgment is at its highest. As it is also the final court of appeal this possibility
is increased, both because it only gets difficult cases, and because it need not
fear being overruled. In addition, the incidence of dissent, vital for this type
of analysis, is higher than in any other multi-member court in the United
Kingdom. The principal analysis is carried out only on cases where decisions
were not unanimous.

The Basic Method and its Justification

It is assumed that a judicial ideology of the type hypothesized will show itself
in two ways - by causing some pairs of judges to think more alike than others,
and by causing judges to vary in the preponderance of their votes for
particular sides in cases characterized by certain issues. Both of these
assumptions are also made by judicial behaviouralists in the United States,
although they conceptualize the problem differently, and use different
techniques. Thus the basic method has two stages. The first extracts from data
on judicial voting some description of the degree of affinity between judges.
The second explores whether or not these affinity relationships are correlated
with differences in support for certain types of litigant.
In the first stage we take the cases for the period and construct a measure
of agreement for each pair of judges where this is possible. The 'agreement
index' is simply the proportion of all cases the pair of judges heard together
on which they voted the same way. This matrix says nothing about the
direction of influence in agreement, or the depth of agreement in detail, but
reflects only the fact of concurring or dissenting judgments. The 'agreement
index' matrix is decomposed by multi-dimensional analysis into a two
dimensional representation of judicial agreement. This represents the agreement/disagreement
ratios of judges in what is hoped is an intuitively
comprehensible way. The more judges agree, the closer their positions are in
the underlying assumed 'ideological space'. The idea of 'ideological space' is,
of course, only a metaphor, but a useful one.
The second stage tries to identify the as yet meaningless dimensions of this
space. This is done by taking several basic categories of cases where different
'sides' can be unambiguously and meaningfully identified. The tendency of a
judge to vote for a particular side is measured by the proportion of all cases in
a particular category in which he gave judgment for that side. These
'category scores' are correlated in various ways with the positions of the
judges on each dimension. The resulting pattern, in which the dimensions of
the spatial representation are shown to be correlated with category voting, is

held to be a rough description of certain aspects of the hypothesized judicial
ideology.
In a third and final stage a different question is asked. Can these
'substantive' patterns be seen as representing a more fundamental single
difference that makes general theoretical sense of English judges' behaviour?
By examining the voting patterns of two active and intellectually dominant
Law Lords of the period it is argued that this may be the case

Research Problems, Solutions, and Some Working Assumptions

Why has no jurimetrics been done on the English House of Lords, when so
much has been done on the Supreme Courts of the United States and Canada
and on the High Court of Australia?18 Because it is very much harder,
technically, to do such research in Britain. As mentioned above, one
American political scientist has argued that jurimetrics simply cannot be
applied in Britain.19 No other example is known to me.
The most obvious problems relate to the structures and practice of our
Higher Appellate Courts. Compared with the United States Supreme Court,
the House of Lords (a) hears far fewer cases in a year (perhaps forty to fifty
compared with well over a hundred); (b) decides far more of them unanimously
(70-80 per cent in Britain, rarely even 50 per cent in the United
States, according to Schubert's research); (c) has more judges but hears cases
with less. (In the House, a bench of five Law Lords, drawn from eleven or
twelve more or less at random, hears each case, while in the United States the
norm is for all nine Justices to vote on each case.) The immediate result is the
paucity of data. Because of these differences, Schubert could analyse each
year's voting separately, and still have plenty of cases to determine the
agreement for each pair of judges as well as having a large number of cases for
both his 'political liberalism' and 'economic liberalism' dimensions.
There is another difference of practice that raises for my research a
problem Schubert did not have to face. On the United States Bench majority
and dissenting judges usually group together, offering joint opinions,
although there may be more than one opinion for both majority and minority.
In Britain it is quite usual to issue five separate, and often radically different,
opinions even when all the judges vote the same way! This involves the
following very strong assumption: when two judges vote the same way in a
case, they can be taken to be substantially in agreement in preferring that one
side win the case rather than the other.20 Although this may not seem an

over-demanding assumption, it could make certain conclusions false if drawn
from data heavily characterized by a special sort of case. This is a case, quite
frequent in English law, where one or more judges who think X ought to win
in fact vote for Y because they feel bound by a precedent they dislike, and
where some vote for Y feeling the precedent is itself desirable. Because the
American court is much freer to overturn precedents than the House of
Lords, Schubert and his associates have less need to justify this assumption.
The justification is that we are not only interested in the inner meaning of a
judge's decision. To a major extent the statement that judge X has a
particular type of judicial ideology is an external judgement based on the
consequence of his vote. For example, in the IT Case Lord Reid's decision
was just as much a vote against individual freedom of expression, and had just
as much effect on the freedom of press enjoyed by International Tribune as
Lord Morris's, even though Reid felt the binding precedent to be wrong and
had voted against it in the original case while Morris had supported the
prosecution willingly on both occasions.21
There is a final difference between the American and the English experience
that makes Schubert's kind of analysis much harder to perform on
English data. It does not affect this article, because I take a totally different
approach to the characterization (the 'coding') of decisions from Schubert's.
The difference is that, because the United States has a written constitution
and a Bill of Rights, the clauses and principles of which enter into real
political conflict and political language, it is much easier to assert that case N
is an example of category Z. For example, in the United States an obscene
publications case will be fought expressly in terms of a constitutional 'positive
law' prohibition on censorship in the first amendment. So for Schubert to
'code' a case as belonging to the 'political liberalism' category is fairly safe.
Here a similar case will be fought in terms of varying interpretations of one or
more statutes, using legal categories that may not translate at all into the
language of political ideology. To claim that a case involving contractual
infringement on freedom of trade fits into a category of economic conservatism
would be much more subjective and difficult to defend than an equivalent
in the United States. There it would probably arise under the Inter-State
Commerce clause where decades of Congressional debate make clear what
political lines are drawn up.
An analyst must, in the end, impose his own categories. I have attempted
to stick fairly close to legally existing categories, because I wish to interpret
the resulting dimensions of judicial ideology as far as possible in terms of legal
ideologies rather than, as with Schubert, asserting ideologies that have
nothing directly to do with what judges may think they are doing. Yet again it

judges agreeing on how to dispose of a case may in fact have very different views. From my point
of view this difference is irrelevant here, although it might have been preferable to take the
distinction so as to record degrees of agreement. Unfortunately the available data are too sparse
for this.

Because a Law Lord's membership of the House overlaps with others arriving
and retiring at different dates, we cannot treat the seventeen Law Lords who
held office during I965-78 as forming one court. Instead they have been
treated as falling into three groups, an early, late, and continuing section.
Those five who were present for most of the period, Lords Reid, Morris,
Diplock, Dilhorne and Wilberforce, are analysed twice, once when put with
the early court, and once when put with the late court. So in carrying out the

Little can be obtained directly from these tables, although they may be
used to test various hypotheses. One hypothesis worth testing, if only to
reject it, is the effect of previous political affiliations on judicial relationships.
Although the old tendency for senior judges to have had political careers is
almost over, several of the men studied here have either been MPs or stood as
parliamentary candidates when they were barristers. Lord Donovan was once
a Labour MP, Lord Dilhorne (as Manningham-Buller) was a Conservative
Attorney-General and Lord Chancellor, Lords Guest and Wilberforce were
Conservative candidates, and Lord Reid a Scottish Unionist MP and Lord
Advocate. The obvious test is to consider the average 'distance' or similarity
between one Labour MP, Lord Donovan, and both the known Conservative
group and those not known to be Conservative. These latter are Lords
Pearce, Upjohn, Diplock and Morris (who is an ex-Liberal candidate). If this
is a fair test of the relevance of past party affiliation, then partisanship is
shown to be irrelevant. The average distance between Donovan and the two
groups is not significantly different. Indeed, his average agreement with the
known Conservatives, 0-74, is slightly greater that that with the non-political
group, at 0-72. The agreement between Donovan and Dilhorne, presumably
the pair most likely to be affected by their past roles, is, at o08i, above
average for the whole table. It might be remembered, should this result seem
unimportant, that such a result would most certainly not arise from a similar
table on American judges.22
The real use of these agreement/similarity matrices is to decompose them,
using multi-dimensional analysis. This technique, extensively used in cognitive
sociology and psychology, is able to represent a complicated pattern of
such similarity measures in a much simpler way, using the minimum necessary
set of scales or dimensions, without doing serious damage to the original
relationships.23 It is akin to the more familiar factor analysis in assuming that
a set of correlations between variables or people is explained by the several
data 'representing' or 'measuring' an underlying set of basic factors.
In order to discover such 'explainable' judicial affinities, both similarity
matrices were submitted to an MDSCAL analysis.24 The results, in terms of
positions on each of three necessary 'underlying' dimensions, are given in
Tables 4 and 5.
These solutions are not technically very good, because the stress coefficients
(which give a measure of how much the original relationships have had
to be altered in order to be displayed in a small set of dimensions) are rather
high. However, no serious problem arises because the configurations are only

22 But not all appointments to the Supreme Court have always worked like this. Eisenhower's
disappointment with the Republican, Earl Warren, is a notable case in point. However, most
studies of the judiciary at the state level show a fairly strong connection between judicial voting
and partisanship.

putative total 'explanation' of judicial decision making, which would be to

identify and characterize just some of these aspects. It is sufficient to say that
the agreements between judges can be displayed, very crudely, as concerning
some two or three dimensions, and to try to identify these.
The results in Tables 4 and 5 do suggest more clearly than the original
similarity matrices some of the contrasts between Law Lords that could be
explained in terms of a judicial ideology. A sharp contrast exists between
Lords Reid and Diplock, who are at opposite ends of the second, as yet
unidentified, dimension. Lords Pearce and Guest have something in common
(they are close on both dimensions) which makes them opposed to Lords
Pearson and Donovan. Whatever this 'something' is, it operates in a different
field from whatever it is that separates Reid and Diplock. This latter distance
is on the first, not the second, dimension.
What are these differences? The interpretation of a multi-dimensional
scaling analysis is not a statistical and objective exercise, although statistical
measures can help. It is a substantive judgement, a fitting of substantively
meaningful patterns to an objective and numerically derived pattern. Essentially
one forms hypotheses about what might underlie the observed patterns,
and one tests them. An example that might appeal to exponents of the
'orthodox' model is that differences in judicial experience or training are the
real 'causes' of such spatial configurations. But in fact comparing judges from
Scottish, Common Law or Chancery backgrounds throws no light on the
three-dimensional array here. Of course further dimensions, if extracted,
might well show up such a 'training' pattern.25

INTERPRETING THE DIMENSIONS

The explanations we are seeking are couched in terms of a 'judicial' ideology
- reflexive positions on issues of a politico-legal nature - echoing or leading to
a (perhaps only marginal) preference for supporting a particular type of cause
or litigant. There are many such potential candidates, as many as there are
issues. We pick two major ones, because they have been much discussed both
in academic and popular circles. Both can be characterized in the language of
politics as exemplifying degrees of 'conservatism' and, more academically,
both relate to the power and nature of the state in modern liberal democracies.
The first, more obvious candidate, is that of attitudes to criminal law. It
is a matter of speculation at all levels of the press whether Mr Justice X is
harder or tougher on criminals than Mr Justice Y. Whilst this might be studied

as criminal trial judges, might see due process differently from those who have a different legal

wills and trusts.

Judicial Ideology Judicial in the House of Lords Ideology Judicial in the House of Lords Ideology in the House of Lords

at the level of the criminal courts of first instance, there are good reasons for
taking it more seriously as a question about appeal judges.
When asked about trial judges, who do not decide guilt, it is a question
about sentencing practice, and probably reflects psychological differences, or
differences about theories of criminal deterrence. Asked of Law Lords, it is a
question about legal beliefs, for the issues in criminal appeals to the Lords
are, for example, about the acceptability of evidence. They are about whether
an alleged crime is, in fact, forbidden by the law; the fairness of summings up;
police investigatory behaviour; or definitions in statutes, all informed by, and
relevant to, the general area of criminal civil liberties.
To be a hard-line 'pro-prosecution' judge in the House of Lords is to take a
robust attitude to claims that it would be unfair actually to punish someone
whom a jury had convicted of doing what the police said he did. This is clearly
a political, but also a legal, attitude, and it is one that can fairly be judged
'conservative' in one of the many senses of that word.26
A second dimension worth investigating relates to the non-criminal coercion
of the state. I call this, for want of a better phrase, the 'public law'
aspect. By public law I include all non-criminal cases where one of the
litigants is the state in some form or other, and the other is an individual
(although he may be an artificial individual, as in the legal sense, a
corporation, local government, trade union or Church). I exclude all 'revenue'
cases of whatever form from this category, for they raise special problems. So
we may be talking about the right of a Town Council to withdraw a market
trader's licence because he was seen urinating against a wall,27 about a habeas
corpus plea by an alleged fugitive from a foreign government sentenced to
deportation,28 about an industry claiming the right to a subsidy the Ministry of
Technology does not want to grant,29 or about the owner of a Caravan Park
refused planning permission.30
Of course this is a broad category, imposed on what professional lawyers
would see as separate areas of the law. But any decision in favour of the state
means supporting the central coercive power against a weaker individual
attempting to assert a right, privilege, or immunity. Like the criminal law
category discussed earlier, it is immediately cashable into a dimension of real
politics, is expressable in ordinary and academic political language, and
represents a version of conservatism. That the 'conservatism' inherent in
supporting the state in criminal prosecutions does not necessarily go with
26 I have no desire to apply contentious labels. Whatever the philosophy of conservatism says,
however, hard line 'law and order' attitudes are associated with the politico-psychological
syndrome of conservatism. See Hans J. Eysenck, The Psychology of Politics (London: Routledge,
1954).
27 This particular case actually never got beyond the Queen's Bench Division, but there are
many roughly similar cases. Take, for example, the long line of cases dealing with the regulation
of Bingo Halls, which raise similar problems of natural justice. 28 Armah v. Government of Ghana (1968) A.C.192. 29 British Oxygen Ltd. v. Minister of Technology (1971), A.C.6io.

According to our basic research design, separate scores are calculated for
each Law Lord on these categories. It is simply a matter of calculating what
proportion of criminal appeals a judge decided in favour of the state. The full
data for these two variables are reported in Table 6. In many cases, as can be
seen, the number of cases of a particular type decided by a judge are so few as
to make the resulting proportions highly unreliable. None the less a rough
picture emerges, even from a casual inspection, that begins to identify the two
first dimensions of the ideological map, at least for the 'early' court.
Tables 7 and 8 give more exact support, reporting correlation coefficients
that measure the relationship between each variable and each dimension. It is
clear that for both courts the first dimension is significantly correlated with
tendencies to support the prosecution in criminal law cases. For the 'early'
court, it is also clear that the second dimension of the judicial affinity map is
significantly correlated with the state/individual distinction suggested for
cases of public law.

Because it is unreliable to count judges separately, it seemed sensible to
group judges together according to the clusterings shown in the tables. Thus,
although one might be uneasy about comparing Lords X and Y, who heard
only thirty public law cases between them, one can feel happier comparing
group X and group Y, natural clusterings of judges on the map, who may have
heard a hundred cases between them. Such groupings allow one to retain a
disaggregating emphasis on the differences between judicial ideologies,
something the class model so completely ignores. This grouping also allows
one to offer certain explanations for a change over time in the dimensions of
judicial ideology that will shortly appear.
Rather than group the judges together intuitively by inspecting a map, a
process that leaves the analyst open to charges of arranging the data to suit his

disaggregating emphasis on the differences between judicial ideologies,
something the class model so completely ignores. This grouping also allows
one to offer certain explanations for a change over time in the dimensions of
judicial ideology that will shortly appear.
Rather than group the judges together intuitively by inspecting a map, a
process that leaves the analyst open to charges of arranging the data to suit his
purposes, an objective grouping was achieved by using a single cluster
analysis programme. The input data for this programme (Johnson's Hierarchical
Clustering programme HICLUS)31 were the original similarity matrices
used for the MDSCAL analysis. The groupings of judges, representing

TABLE 9 Cluster Analysis Grouping Information

Because of the unreliability of the individual judge data, cluster analysis was used on
each set of Law Lords to produce, for each set, two groups of judges. The input matrix
for each analysis was that used for the MDSC solution. The clustering that produced
only two groups and included all judges from the set was chosen for simplicity. The
clustering is instrumental only, and was not intended to support any hypothesis. In
each case Johnson's Hierarchical Clustering Program HICLUS was used, and the
solutions obtained used the Diameter method.

I ist Set of Law Lords
The two-group solution yields the following groups:
A
Lords Guest, Wilberforce, Pearce, Reid and Upjohn.
B
Lords Diplock, Dilhorne, Donovan, Hodson, Morris and Pearson.

II 2nd Set of Law Lords
The two-group solution yields:
A1
Lords Morris, Reid, Dilhorne and Simon.
B1
Lords Edmund-Davies, Diplock, Kilbrandon, Salmon, Wilberforce and Cross.

'natural' clusterings from this original proximity data are reported in Table 9.
They do not entirely correspond with the 'eyeball' groupings one might
construct for the map. This is because the maps would be one- or twodimensional
representations of what should have been a multi-dimensional
solution. They are more reliable groupings, therefore, and the fact that such
groupings replicate the ideological distinctions reported makes one more
confident in the conclusions, not only because sample sizes of cases in
categories are now much greater, but because all available information on
judicial similarities has been utilized.
With these groups we can repeat the identification of the main dimensions
in a more easily interpretable fashion, by looking directly at tables of
decisions. Instead of talking about the relationship between dimensions and
categories, we can address ourselves directly to the performance of groups of
judges; the connection between these groups and the dimensional locations is
still fairly strong.
First let us note, in Table Io, the strength and permanence, during both
early and late courts, of a criminal law dimension. Groups A and B in the
early court, and A1 and B1 in the later, are significantly different in their
probability of supporting the prosecution in such cases. The distinction is
much the same in both courts. There is a 12 percentage point difference for
the first court: Group B (Lords Diplock, Dilhorne, Donovan, Hodson, Morris
and Pearson) are significantly less likely to find for the criminal accused in
such cases. In the second court Group B1 is I i percentage points more likely

court's Group B are now in the 'softer' Group A1 compared with others in the

This suggests, and the suggestion is borne out by Table 15, that there has
been a general shift to the 'pro prosecution' end of this distinction as a result
of new members. If, following Table 12, we use the time groupings 'early',
'continuing' and 'late' instead of proximity groupings, we find no difference
between those present only in the 'early' court and those present in both
courts, but a 15-16 percentage point difference in pro-prosecution tendencies

This is slightly premature. Returning to Table I I, we see the change in the

there is a dramatic difference in preparedness to uphold the state over the
individual. While Group B (those most prosecution minded in criminal
appeals) has only a 46 per cent probability of supporting the state in civil
cases, Group A, the ones most 'liberal' in criminal cases, are much more
likely (63 per cent) to support the state against the 'non-criminal' individual.
This is a fascinating result, and one that makes theoretical sense; but it is a
warning to those prone to an over-facile belief in the 'conservatism' of the

For note that the 'continual group' were the same as the 'early group' in

The 'early' court in many ways is more interesting than the 'late', because
the pattern of group differences in the former can be shown to extend widely

prevailing judicial ideologies will be 'legal' or 'professional' that they should
enter not only into cases of criminal and public law that are obviously
'politically relevant', but into the less obviously 'political' cases of day-to-day
civil law. A serious criticism of both class models and of jurimetrics is that
they restrict so considerably the scope of 'political' cases. For surely anything

Where the issues are simple and the dispute limited to the interests of the two parties
the judge may fulfil his traditional function. Divorce, the meaning of a contract
between businessmen, a personal claim for injury sustained in a road accident, the
buying and selling of a house - for these the traditional view often suffices. But less
simple issues can easily emerge . . Then other persons and even the state itself may
be involved.34

It is much harder, especially in this sort of aggregative statistical analysis, to
investigate judicial ideology in ordinary civil law, for one cannot easily rule on
what 'sides' of a case 'ought' to be voted for by which ideological affinity
group. But at least one fairly simple extension can be made. Many civil cases
can be seen as involving litigants of clearly unequal 'power', 'resources', or
'status'. A victim of a road accident who sues a road haulage firm is clearly the
weaker, more vulnerable, 'side'.35 So is a policeman trying to appeal against a
court which reduced the damages (paid in any case by an insurance firm) he
was entitled to from an accident in no way his fault because he would get a
small pension.36 More typically, workers trying to sue for industrial injuries
against large firms can hardly be seen as equal participants.37 As many as
possible of our cases were therefore coded according to whether both sides
were effectively equal, or one or other clearly more powerful than the other.
Table 13 shows how the groups A and B who were clearly different in their
attitudes to public law carried this difference over into civil cases where an
analogous inequality existed. As it shows, the pattern is maintained, although
not as sharply. Although there is no statistically significant difference
between groups A and B, Group B none the less has less than a fifty-fifty
chance of voting for the more 'powerful' side, while Group A has nearly a
60 per cent probability of supporting, in civil as well as public law, the bigger
side. Table 14 may well reflect this difference too, for it takes only cases in
contract law (widely interpreted to include many Admiralty cases). Here the
pattern gives us a I6 percentage point difference, with Group B much less

likely to find for the plaintiff. The data are harder to interpret without a
time-consuming study of each case, but the logic of contract law tells us that
the plaintiff is someone trying to enforce an obligation on one who, a priori,
has failed to satisfy it. It seems quite plausible that this difference reflects a
greater preparedness to 'accept excuses' (as it were), to mitigate the
fierceness of demands that, in strict law, should be enforced. There may not
be a logical connection between these three phenomena - supporting
individuals against the state, the weak against the strong, and those who fail
to live up to strict contractual obligations - but tests of logical entailment
seldom work when applied to ideologies. Certainly there is an
emotional appeal common to the three situations, and although a future,
more detailed, investigation of the cases might make the point better,38 I
would suggest we see here a strong ideological 'fit' that engages both political
and 'legal' traditions that, if conservative, is so in a rather populist way.
To sum up this more objective part of the analysis, we have good reason to
believe that judges vary systematically in their use of discretion in at least two
politically relevant areas, public and criminal law. Both a strictly individual
analysis, and, more reliably, an affinity-group analysis distributed judges on
dimensions registering Statism versus Individualism and Criminal Toughness
versus Libertarianism. These distinctions are partially dependent on the
judges' period of service: in the 'later' court there is near unanimity in being
more 'individualistic' than 'statist', such that this dimension fails to distinguish
groups as it did in the 'early' court. There still remains a serious cleavage on
'Criminal Toughness' because the newer appointees are markedly more
'prosecution oriented' that those who remain from the earlier court, although
some of these were, in the previous court, themselves on the 'tougher' side.

judgments is therefore demonstrated in a way not entirely compatible with
either class or orthodox models. Our interpretation is also different from
American research into judicial behaviour.

JUDICIAL METHODOLOGY AS AN UNDERLYING DIMENSION

One is still a little hesitant in regarding this as more than surface evidence, or
as an approximation. Might there not be a 'deeper structure' to judicial
ideology, a yet further, less substantive, ideological distinction, one more
directly related to judges' role perceptions than the distinction so far
demonstrated? The discovery of such a deeper structure would not invalidate
the results above; rather it would offer an answer to a troubling question.
Why should some judges be more 'prosecution minded' or more 'statist' than
others? Of course, some answers to this may be highly personal, lacking the
generalizable nature of an ideological, professionally ratiocinative, categorization.
Still it seems worthwhile asking whether there exist some very basic
distinctions of judicial technique, judicial craftsmanship, and ultimate reactions
to the nature of the law. One is asking, in effect, whether the tendency
of Lord Z to find for the prosecution might depend not so much on his
wanting to incarcerate the accused as on the interaction between the structure
of criminal law and a belief he holds about how to apply law in general. Are
there basic, purely 'methodological' or role beliefs that might generate the
results shown above, or at least combine with the basic predispositions they
demonstrate?
Several known questions about the judicial role might serve as a test, apart
from the argument from precedent that I dismiss. One might consider judges'
views on the well-known rules of interpretation. Lord Simon has shown how a
commitment to apply these systematically can lead a judge to a view without
the nature of the litigants' interests being important. But all judges have
roughly the same knowledge and understanding of these.39 One might take,
from the Americans, a methodological distinction between 'strict' and 'wide'
constructionism as the prevailing determinant of actual decisions.
There may well be something in this. Table 15 demonstrates the effect of
taking this variable into account in analysing the previously documented
difference in the 'early' court on criminal justice. I have coded a group of

prosecution case. A 'narrow' interpretation is one where terms or words are
considerably restricted in their scope, rather than being given a 'purposive' or

In one Wilberforce took a 'strict construction' approach in order to uphold
the intention of Parliament to allow a Water Authority to levy rates, in the
other he took a 'liberal' line to protect an immigrant from deportation.
Dilhorne reversed his 'methodology' in the other direction, in order to relieve
the rate payer and to support the Home Office against the immigrant.
Griffith helps make this point. In commenting on the Race Relations cases,
he attacks the minimizing interpretation of the Act,
the alternative view does not found itself on this individualistic position, does not think
primarily of private rights. It makes other assumptions. It seeks to interpret the Race
Relations Act in a way which will extend its operation and not restict it ... It regards
racial discrimination not as an individual right but as a social wrong41

although I doubt whether he means the point to be taken in quite this fashion.
He argues that the Lords should have chosen to interpret the meaning of 'the
public or a section of the public' in such a way as to extend, rather than
restrict, the scope of the Act.
One can see that a very general distinction might exist between those who
believe that statutes and precedents should, in general, be pushed to their
logical conclusions, that law should continually extend the scope of its rights,
obligations, duties and privileges, and a more cautious school. The more
cautious would not necessarily, as Griffith believes, be protecting traditional
privileges against reform, but much more generally be restricting legal
intervention in life to the clearly intended minimum of legislators, both
parliamentary and judicial. The 'extensionists' might be likened to social
engineers, eager to solve as many problems and disputes as possible by
extension of legal machinery, largely irrespective of the particular sides they
favoured. The 'restrictionists', however, would be more conservative, being
dubious of human potential to legislate solutions in general, and keen to keep
tricky cases and problems out of the law.

In one Wilberforce took a 'strict construction' approach in order to uphold
the intention of Parliament to allow a Water Authority to levy rates, in the
other he took a 'liberal' line to protect an immigrant from deportation.
Dilhorne reversed his 'methodology' in the other direction, in order to relieve
the rate payer and to support the Home Office against the immigrant.

research of some subtlety, involving a complex coding of many cases that has
as yet not been undertaken. However, I can not only argue that it would
make sense of the previous findings, but also indicate its plausibility in Table
I6. So delicate a categorization as between 'extensive' and 'restrictive' coding
of the central intent of cases cannot easily be done for many judges, so I
discuss only one pair of judges, amongst the most active for the period
covered here, Lords Reid and Morris. More narrowly still, I consider only
nineteen randomly chosen non-unanimous cases that they both heard, which I
could categorize in terms of which side was pushing an 'extensive' interpretation
and which a 'restrictive' interpretation of the law. Reid was the leading
member of Group A during the 'early' court, i.e., those less prosecutionminded
but also more statist and more 'power prone' in the ordinary civil
cases. Morris was the longest serving member of Group B, hearing more
cases than any Law Lord after Reid. Table I6 shows that a restrictive/
extensive distinction accounts very well indeed for this group difference. Of
the nineteen cases, Reid voted for the 'restrictive' interpretation thirteen
times, while Morris voted for the 'extensive' argument sixteen times; Reid fits
the pattern 68 per cent of the time, Morris 84 per cent. Alternatively, only
nine out of thirty-eight (24 per cent) of their decisions do not fit.
A suggestion as pregnant for the understanding of discretionary judgement
as this, largely because it is uncontroversial and orthodox, will not be
accepted without much more sophisticated, probably non-statistical, evidence.
Nor should it be. I would argue, however, that a serious case has been
made out for the existence, in Britain, of a specifically judicial ideology, in
part characterized by the Criminal Justice and Public Law dimensions
demonstrated above, and in part explained by a deeper distinction, a
systematically maintained choice between extending and restricting the
general scope of law.
Naturally there is very much more to do before this style of analysis has
proved itself. It needs to be extended to other courts, to more areas of law,
and to other possible restrictions on decisions. Two overwhelming questions
stand out, each capable of solution by jurimetrics of this type. The first is
about discretion. Just how much do judges think there is? Where and why
does it appear? Much has been written in general terms about this, but we
have little systematic evidence, without which we cannot properly estimate
the relevance of the research presented here. The second question is more
properly one for political science. We can hardly believe that the views of all
judges are equally important in influencing their brethren; but who are the
more influential, and why, we cannot yet say, although once again a
jurimetric approach could say quite a lot. For the moment one dares to say
that there does appear to exist the sort of ideology, with the sort of
consequences, that our basic premises outline.
