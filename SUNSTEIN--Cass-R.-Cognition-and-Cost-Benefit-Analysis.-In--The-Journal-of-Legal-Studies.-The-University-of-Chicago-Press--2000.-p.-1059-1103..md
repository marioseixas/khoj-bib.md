COGNITION AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

CASS R. SUNSTEIN*

Abstract

Cost-benefit analysis is often justified on conventional economic grounds, as a
way of preventing inefficiency. But it is most plausibly justified on cognitive
grounds—as a way of counteracting predictable problems in individual and social
cognition. Poor judgments, by individuals and societies, can result from certain heuristics,
from informational and reputational cascades, from thinking processes in
which benefits are ‘‘on screen’’ but costs are not, from ignoring systemic effects of
one-shot interventions, from seeing cases in isolation, and from intense emotional
reactions. Cost-benefit analysis serves as a corrective to these cognitive problems.
In addition, it is possible to arrive at an incompletely theorized agreement on costbenefit
analysis—an agreement that does not depend on controversial arguments
(for example, the view that willingness to pay should be the basis for all social
outcomes) and that can attract support from a variety of reasonable views. There is
discussion as well of the role of distributional weights and other equitable factors
in cost-benefit analysis. The conclusion is that the best argument for cost-benefit
analysis is rooted in cognitive psychology and behavioral economics.

The American people have no doubt that more people die from
coal dust than from nuclear reactions, but they fear the prospect
of a nuclear reactor more than they do the empirical data that
would suggest that more people die from coal dust, having coalfired
burners. They also know that more lives would be saved if
we took that 25 percent we spend in the intensive care units in
the last few months of the elderly’s lives, more children would
be saved. But part of our culture is that we have concluded as a
culture that we are going to rightly, or wrongly, we are going to
spend the money, costing more lives, on the elderly. . . . I think
it’s incredibly presumptuous and elitist for political scientists to
conclude that the American people’s cultural values in fact are
not ones that lend themselves to a cost-benefit analysis and pre-

sume that they would change their cultural values if in fact they
were aware of the cost-benefit analysis.1
Many people have argued for cost-benefit analysis on economic
grounds.2 On their view, a primary goal of regulation is to promote economic
efficiency, and cost-benefit analysis is admirably well suited to that
goal. Arguments of this kind have met with sharp criticism from those who
reject the efficiency criterion3 or who believe that, in practice, cost-benefit
analysis is likely to produce a kind of regulatory paralysis.4
In this essay I offer support for cost-benefit analysis, not from the standpoint
of conventional economics, but on grounds associated with cognitive
psychology and behavioral economics. My basic suggestion is that costbenefit
analysis is best defended as a means of overcoming predictable
problems in individual and social cognition. Most of these problems might
be collected under the general heading of selective attention. Cost-benefit
analysis should be understood as a method for putting ‘‘on screen’’ important
social facts that might otherwise escape private and public attention.
Thus understood, cost-benefit analysis is a way of ensuring better priority
setting and of overcoming predictable obstacles to desirable regulation,
whatever may be our criteria for deciding the hardest questions about that
topic.
Of course, much of the controversy over cost-benefit analysis stems from
the difficulty of specifying, with particularity, what that form of analysis
entails. None of the cognitive points made here supports any particular understanding
of cost-benefit analysis. Certainly I do not mean to embrace the
controversial and indeed implausible proposition that all regulatory decisions
should be made by aggregating private willingness to pay, as if economic
efficiency is or should be the goal of all regulation.5 I will attempt

instead to provide an understanding of cost-benefit analysis that is agnostic
on large issues of the right and the good and that can attract support from
people with diverse theoretical commitments or with uncertainty about the
appropriate theoretical commitments.6 In this sense I attempt to produce an
incompletely theorized agreement on a certain form of cost-benefit analysis—an
agreement on a form of cost-benefit analysis to which many different
people, with diverse and competing views, should be willing to subscribe.
This is partly an attempt to respond to the most natural objection to
my principal claim here, an objection that would stress the possibility that
cognitive problems would reappear in the values that end up being associated
with various states of affairs.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sections I, II, and III, I seek to
defend the general idea of cost-benefit analysis, not as embodying any sectarian
conception of value, but as a way of overcoming predictable problems
in understanding risks to life and health at both the individual and social
levels. In Section IV, I briefly attempt to specify what cost-benefit
analysis might be understood to entail. My goal is to show how this
method, conceived in a particular way, might attract support from people
with varying conceptions of the good and the right, including, for example,
neoclassical economists and those who are quite skeptical about some normative
claims in neoclassical economics, involving those who do and who
do not take private preferences, and willingness to pay, as the proper foundation
for regulatory policy. In other words, I try to show how a certain
understanding of cost-benefit analysis might contain considerable appeal
precisely because it overcomes problems in individual cognition, and I do
so without taking a stand on controversial issues about the ultimate goals
of regulation and law.

I. A Tale of Two Tables

Let us begin with two simple tables. It is well known that there is a
great deal of variability in national expenditures per life saved. Consider
Table 1, which has come to define many discussions of these problems.7
This table should be taken with many grains of salt.8 It does not contain
nearly all of the benefits from regulation, including those that fall short of
mortalities averted (including illnesses averted, benefits for animals, and

same general spirit as this essay, and from which I have learned a great deal. 7 Based on data from Office of Management and Budget, Budget of the United States Government

aesthetic and recreational gains). An adequate cost-benefit analysis would
certainly take those benefits into account. (See the Appendix.) We will
shortly see that the table depends on many contentious assumptions, above
all involving the appropriate discount rate; modest changes in the discount
rate can greatly reduce the expenditures and the disparities. But at the very
least, the table creates a presumption that the current system of regulation
suffers from serious misallocation of resources. It also suggests that with
better allocations, we could obtain large gains. Indeed, a recent study finds
that it would be possible to save the same number of lives that we now save
with tens of billions of dollars left over—and that better priority setting
could save 60,000 lives, and 636,000 life-years, annually at the same price.9
What is the source of the misallocations? Interest-group power undoubtedly
plays a substantial role, because well-organized groups are able to obtain
measures in their interest or to fend off measures that would harm
them, and because poorly organized ones typically fail. Indeed, cost-benefit
analysis might be defended partly as a corrective to interest-group power,
operating as a kind of technocratic check on measures that would do little
good or even produce net harm (and also on measures that do much less
good than they should).10 But officials are of course responsive not only to
interest groups but also to general public pressures, and thus part of the answer
must lie in the distinctive judgments of ordinary people, who do not
assess risks through a well-informed cost-benefit lens. Indeed, divergences
between expert and lay assessments of risks have been demonstrated in
many places. Consider the comparison in Table 2.11
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) itself has found that EPA
policies are responsive not to expert judgments but to lay assessments of
risks.12 Indeed, EPA policies track ordinary judgments extremely well.
If we put together these two tables, we can suggest a general hypothesis.
The government currently allocates its limited resources poorly, and it does
so partly because it is responsive to ordinary judgments about the magnitude
of risks. A government that could insulate itself from misinformed
judgments could save tens of thousands of lives and tens of billions of dollars
annually. Let us attempt to be more specific about the cognitive problems
that help account for current problems.

II. Six Problems in the Public Demand for Regulation

For the moment, I attempt no controversial specification of cost-benefit
analysis and understand the term broadly to refer to a regulatory method
that calls for regulators to identify, and make relevant for purposes of decision,
the good effects and the bad effects of regulation and to quantify those
as much as possible in terms of both dollar equivalents and life-years saved,
hospital admissions prevented, workdays gained, and so forth. (See the Appendix
for examples from the EPA’s regulation for ozone and particulates.)
Let us also assume that cost-benefit analysis, thus understood, can accommodate
distributional factors, by, for example, giving distributional weights
to certain adverse effects, or by assuming uniform numbers for various
goods (such as increased longevity) so as to ensure that they do not vary in
accordance with wealth.
It is obvious that people, including government officials, often lack riskrelated
information; they may not know the nature of the health risks at

COGNITION AND CBA 1065

issue or the adverse consequences of risk reduction. By itself this point argues
for cost-benefit analysis, simply as a means of producing the relevant
information. The public demand for regulation is often based on misunderstandings
of facts.13 But put this obvious point to one side. Why, exactly,
might people’s judgments about risk and risk regulation go badly wrong?14
There are six points here.

A. The Availability Heuristic

The first problem is purely cognitive: the use of the availability heuristic
in thinking about risks.15 It is well established that people tend to think that
events are more probable if they can recall an incident of its occurrence.16
Consider, for example, the fact that people typically think that more words,
on any given page, will end with the letters ‘‘ing’’ than have ‘‘n’’ as the
second-to-last letter (though a moment’s reflection shows that this is not
possible).17 With respect to risks, judgments are typically affected by the
availability heuristic, so that people overestimate the number of deaths from
highly publicized events (motor vehicle accidents, tornados, floods, botulism)
but underestimate the number from less publicized sources (stroke,
heart disease, stomach cancer).18 Similarly, much of the concern with nuclear
power undoubtedly stems from its association with memorable events,
including Hiroshima, Chernobyl, and Three-Mile Island.
To the extent that people lack information, or base their judgments on
mental shortcuts that produce errors,19 a highly responsive government is
likely to blunder. Cost-benefit analysis is a natural corrective, above all because
it focuses attention on the actual effects of regulation, including, in

13 A colorful discussion is Barry R. Glassner, The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are
Afraid of the Wrong Things (1999). 14 Some of these problems may infect market behavior as well, and when this is so there
is a problem with using private willingness to pay as the basis for regulation, since private
willingness to pay will (by hypothesis) be based on a misunderstanding of the facts. But
markets contain some safeguards against these errors, through the budget constraint and opportunities
for learning, and in any case the form of cost-benefit analysis that I support would
not rest on mistaken factual judgments, as discussed in more detail below. 15 See Roger G. Noll & James E. Krier, Some Implications of Cognitive Psychology for
Risk Regulation, 19 J. Legal Stud. 747, 749–60 (1990). 16 See Amos Tversky & Daniel Kahneman, Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and
Biases, in Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases 3, 11 (Daniel Kahneman, Paul
Slovic, & Amos Tversky eds. 1982) (describing the availability heuristic). 17 Amos Tversky & Daniel Kahneman, Extensional versus Intuitive Reasoning: The Conjunction
Fallacy in Probability Judgment, 90 Psychol. Rev. 293, 295 (1983). 18 Jonathan Baron, Thinking and Deciding 218 (2d ed. 1994). 19 Other heuristics are likely to be at work, such as the representativeness heuristic, but
availability is the most important source of distorted public judgments.

some cases, the existence of surprisingly small benefits from regulatory
controls. To this extent cost-benefit analysis should be taken not as undemocratic
but, on the contrary, as a means of fortifying (properly specified)
democratic goals, by ensuring that government decisions are responsive to
well-informed public judgments.

B. Aggravating Social Influences: Informational
and Reputational Cascades

The availability heuristic does not, of course, operate in a social vacuum.
It interacts with emphatically social processes and, in particular, with
informational and reputational forces.20 When one person says, through
words or deeds, that something is or is not dangerous, he creates an informational
externality.21 A signal by some person A will provide relevant
data to others. When there is little private information, such a signal may
initiate an informational cascade, with significant consequences for private
and public behavior, and with possibly distorting effects on regulatory
policy.22
Imagine, for example, that A says that abandoned hazardous waste sites
are dangerous or that A initiates protest activity because such a site is located
nearby. B, otherwise skeptical or in equipoise, may go along with A;
C, otherwise an agnostic, may be convinced that if A and B share the relevant
belief, the belief must be true; and it will take a confident D to resist
the shared judgments of A, B, and C. The result of this set of influences
can be social cascades, as hundreds, thousands, or millions of people come
to accept a certain belief simply because of what they think other people
believe.23 There is nothing fanciful to the idea. Cascade effects help account
for the existence of widespread public concern about abandoned hazardous
waste dumps (a relatively trivial environmental hazard), and in more recent
years, they spurred grossly excessive public fears of the pesticide Alar, of
risks from plane crashes, and of dangers of shootings in schools in the aftermath
of the murders in Littleton, Colorado. Such effects recently helped
produce massive dislocations in beef production in Europe in connection

Risk Regulation, 51 Stan. L. Rev. 683 (1999). 21 See Andrew Caplin & John Leahy, Miracle on Sixth Avenue: Information Externalities
and Search, 108 Econ. J. 60 (1998). 22 See Kuran & Sunstein, supra note 20, at 720. 23 See David Hirshleifer, The Blind Leading the Blind: Social Influence, Fads, and Informational
Cascades, in The New Economics of Human Behavior 188 (Mariano Tommasi &
Kathyrn Ierulli eds. 1995).

with ‘‘mad cow disease’’; they are currently giving rise to growing and apparently
unfounded fears of genetic engineering of food.
On the reputational side, cognitive effects may be amplified as well.24 If
many people are alarmed about some risk, you may not voice your doubts
about whether the alarm is merited, simply in order not to seem obtuse,
cruel, or indifferent. And if many people believe that a certain risk is trivial,
you may not disagree through words or deeds, lest you appear cowardly or
confused. The result of these forces can be cascade effects, mediated by the
availability heuristic. Such effects can produce a public demand for regulation
even though the relevant risks are trivial. At the same time, there may
be little or no demand for regulation of risks that are, in fact, quite large in
magnitude. Self-interested private groups exploit these forces, often by using
the availability heuristic. Consider the fact that European companies
have tried to play up fears of genetically engineered food as a way of fending
off American competition.
Cost-benefit analysis has a natural role here. If it is made relevant to decision,
it can counteract cascade effects induced by informational and reputational
forces, especially when the availability heuristic is at work. The effect
of cost-benefit analysis is to subject a public demand for regulation to
a kind of technocratic scrutiny, to ensure that the demand is not rooted in
myth, and to ensure as well that government is regulating risks even when
the public demand (because insufficiently informed) is low. And here too
there is no democratic problem with the inquiry into consequences. If people’s
concern is fueled by informational forces having little reliability, and
if people express concern even though they are not fearful, a governmental
effort to cool popular reactions is hardly inconsistent with democratic ideals.
Similarly, there is nothing undemocratic about a governmental effort to
divert resources to serious problems that have not been beneficiaries of cascade
effects.

C. Dangers On-Screen, Benefits Off-Screen

Why are people so concerned about the risks of nuclear power, when experts
tend to believe that the risks are quite low—lower, in fact, than the
risks from competing energy sources, such as coal-fired power plants,
which produce relatively little public objection? Why do people believe that
small risks from pesticides should be regulated, even if comparatively small
risks from X-rays are quite tolerable?
Suggestive answers come from research suggesting that for many activities
that pose small risks but that nonetheless receive public concern, people

24 See Kuran & Sunstein, supra note 20, at 727.

1068 THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

perceive low benefits as well as high risks.25 For example, nuclear power
itself is seen as a low-benefit, high-risk activity. Similar findings appear for
some activities that are in fact relatively high risk: a judgment of low risk
accompanies a judgment of high benefits. The very fact that activities are
known to have high benefits skews judgment in their favor and hence
makes people understate the costs as well.
The obvious conclusion is that sometimes people favor regulation of
some risks because the underlying activities are not seen to have compensating
benefits.26 Thus for some activities, trade-offs are not perceived at all.
Dangers are effectively on-screen, but benefits are off-screen. Note that this
is not because such activities do not, in fact, have compensating benefits. It
is because of a kind of perceptual illusion, a cognitive bias.
An important factor here is loss aversion. People tend to be loss averse,
in the sense that a loss from the status quo is seen as more undesirable than
a gain is seen as desirable.27 In the context of risk regulation, the consequence
is that any newly introduced risk, or any aggravation of existing
risks, is seen as a serious problem, even if the accompanying benefits (a
gain from the status quo and hence perceived as less salient and less important)
are considerable.28 Thus when a new risk adds danger, people may focus
on the danger itself and not on the benefits that accompany the danger.
And an important problem here is that in many cases where dangers are onscreen
and benefits off-screen, the magnitude of the danger is actually quite
low. Cost-benefit analysis can be a corrective here, by placing the various
effects on-screen.

D. Systemic Effects and Health-Health Trade-Offs

Often people focus on small pieces of complex problems, and causal
changes are hard to trace. They ‘‘bracket’’ resulting issues. Consider an

25 The fact that nuclear power and application of pesticides produce benefits as well as
risks may not register on the lay viewscreen, and this may help produce a high-risk judgment.
See Ali Siddiq Alhakami & Paul Slovic, A Psychological Study of the Inverse Relationship
between Perceived Risk and Perceived Benefit, 14 Risk Analysis 1085, 1088 (1994). 26 See Howard Margolis, Dealing with Risk (1996), for a detailed discussion of how this
point bears on the different risk judgments of experts and lay people. 27 See Richard H. Thaler, The Psychology of Choice and the Assumptions of Economics,
in Quasi Rational Economics 137, 143 (Richard H. Thaler ed. 1991) (arguing that ‘‘losses
loom larger than gains’’); Daniel Kahneman, Jack L. Knetsch, & Richard H. Thaler, Experimental
Tests of the Endowment Effect and the Coase Theorem, 98 J. Pol. Econ. 1325, 1328
(1990); Colin Camerer, Individual Decision Making, in The Handbook of Experimental Economics

H. Bazerman et al. eds. 1997).

analogy. The German psychologist Dietrich Do¨rner has done some illuminating
computer experiments designed to see whether people can engage in
successful social engineering.29 Participants are asked to solve problems
faced by the inhabitants of some region of the world. Through the magic
of the computer, many policy initiatives are available to solve the relevant
problems (improved care of cattle, childhood immunization, drilling more
wells). But most of the participants produce eventual calamities, because
they do not see the complex, systemwide effects of particular interventions.
Only the rare participant can see a number of steps down the road—to understand
the multiple effects of one-shot interventions on the system.
Often regulation has similar systemic effects. A decision to regulate nuclear
power may, for example, increase the demand for coal-fired power
plants, with harmful environmental consequences.30 A decision to impose
fuel economy standards on new cars may cause a downsizing of the fleet,
and in that way increase risks to life. A decision to ban asbestos may cause
manufacturers to use less safe substitutes. Regulation of tropospheric ozone
may control the health dangers of ozone, but ozone has various benefits as
well, including protection against cataracts and skin cancer; hence regulation
of ozone may cause health problems equal to those that it reduces.31
Indeed, regulation of ozone will increase electricity prices, and because
higher electricity prices will deprive poor people of air conditioning or lead
them to use it less, such regulation may literally kill people.32
These are simply a few examples of situations in which a government
agency is making health-health trade-offs in light of the systemic effects of
one-shot interventions. Indeed, any regulation that imposes high costs will,
by virtue of that fact, produce some risks to life and health, since ‘‘richer
is safer.’’33 A virtue of cost-benefit analysis is that it tends to overcome peo29

ple’s tendency to focus on parts of problems, by requiring them to look
globally at the consequences of apparently isolated actions.

E. Emotions and Alarmist Bias

A set of data now suggests that people are subject to alarmist bias.34 The
mere existence of discussions of new risks can aggravate concern, even
when the discussions take the form of assurances that the risk level is relatively
low. And when presented with information suggesting that a risk may
range from A (low) to Z (high), the high risk number is especially salient,
and it appears to have a disproportionate effect on behavior.
A recent paper by George Loewenstein et al. suggests that risk-related
concerns are often based on feelings rather than judgments.35 Thus riskrelated
objections can be a product not so much of thinking as of intense
emotions, often produced by extremely vivid images of what might go
wrong. This point is supported by evidence that reported feelings of worry
are sometimes sensitive not to the probability of the bad outcome but only
to its severity.36 Vivid mental pictures of widespread death or catastrophe
can drive a demand for risk regulation. Consider, for example, the motivations
of those who press for regulation of airplane safety in the aftermath
of an airplane crash, even though such regulation may increase travel risks
on balance (by driving up the price of flying and causing a shift to driving,
a more dangerous form of transportation).37
It is important to be careful with the relevant categories here. There is
no sharp distinction between cognition and emotion.38 Emotions are generally
the products of beliefs, and hence an emotional reaction to risk—terror,
for example—is generally mediated by judgments.39 But this is not always
true; sometimes the operation of the brain allows intense emotional reacHealth-Health

tions with minimal cognitive activity.40 In any case the judgments that fuel
emotions may be unreliable. We need not venture into controversial territory
in order to urge not that emotions are free of cognition but that some
risks produce extremely sharp, largely visceral reactions. These reactions
can be impervious to argument. Experience with mass panics has shown
exactly this structure, as assurances based on statistical evidence have little
effect in the face of vivid images of what might go wrong.41 Some fears
even appear to have a genetic foundation; consider, as a possible example,
fear of snakes, found in people who have no reason to think that snakes are
dangerous.
The role of cost-benefit analysis is straightforward here. Just as the Senate
was designed to have a cooling effect on the passions of the House of
Representatives, so cost-benefit analysis might ensure that policy is driven
not by hysteria or unfounded alarm but by a full appreciation of the effects
of relevant risks and their control. If the hysteria survives an investigation
of consequences, then the hysteria is fully rational, and an immediate and
intensive regulatory response is entirely appropriate.
Nor is cost-benefit analysis, in this setting, only a check on unwarranted
regulation. It can and should serve as a spur to regulation as well. If risks
do not produce visceral reactions, partly because the underlying activities
do not yield vivid mental images, cost-benefit analysis can show that they
nonetheless warrant regulatory control. The elimination of lead in gasoline
is a case in point.42

F. Separate Evaluation and Incoherence

Suppose that you are asked to say, without reference to any other problem,
how much you would be willing to pay to protect certain threats to
coral reefs. Now suppose that you are asked to say, without reference to
any other problem, how much you would pay to protect against skin cancer
among the elderly. Suppose, finally, that you are asked to say how much
you would be willing to pay to protect certain threats to coral reefs and how
much you would be willing to pay to protect against skin cancer among the
elderly. Empirical evidence suggests that people’s answers to questions
taken in isolation are very different from their answer to questions when
they are asked to engage in cross-category comparisons.43 It appears that

1072 THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

when people assess problems in isolation, they do so by reference to other
problems in the same basic category—and that this intuitive process is dramatically
altered when people are explicitly told to assess problems from
other categories as well. The result of assessing individual problems, taken
in isolation, is to produce what people would themselves consider a form
of incoherence.
The forms of regulatory spending shown in Table 1 undoubtedly reflect,
in part, the kinds of irrationality that follow from judgments that are made
without close reference to other problems from different categories. Incoherence
is the natural result of the relevant cognitive processes. The argument
for a form of cost-benefit analysis is straightforward: it operates as a
built-in corrective to some of the distortions that come from taking problems
in isolation. The point applies to contingent valuation assessments, but
it operates more broadly with respect to expenditure decisions that otherwise
risk incoherence, simply by virtue of the fact that they operate without
looking at other problems, including those from other categories.

G. General Implications

The cognitive argument for cost-benefit analysis is now in place. It is
important but obvious to say that people lack information and that their lack
of information can lead to an inadequate or excessive demand for regulation
or a form of ‘‘paranoia and neglect.’’44 What is less obvious is that predictable
features of cognition will lead to a demand for regulation that is unlikely
to be based on the facts. When people ask for regulation because of
fears fueled by availability cascades, and when the benefits from the riskproducing
activity are not registering, it would be highly desirable to create
cost-benefit filters on their requests. When interest groups exploit cognitive
mechanisms to create unwarranted fear or diminish concern with serious
problems, it is desirable to have institutional safeguards. When people fail
to ask for regulation for related reasons, it would be desirable to create a
mechanism by which government might nonetheless act if the consequences
of action would be good. Here too cost-benefit balancing might be desirable,
as in fact it has proved to be in connection not only with the phaseout
of lead but also with the Reagan administration’s decision to phase out

chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), motivated by a cost-benefit analysis suggesting
that the phaseout would do far more good than harm.45
A caveat: It is entirely possible that the public demand for regulation will
result from something other than cognitive errors, even if the relevant risk
seems low as a statistical matter. People may think, for example, that it is
especially important to protect poor children from a certain risk in a geographically
isolated area, and they may be willing to devote an unusually
large amount to ensure that protection. What seems to be a cognitive error
may turn out, on reflection, to be a judgment of value, and a judgment that
can survive reflection. I will return to this point. For the moment note two
simple points. Whether an error is involved is an empirical question, subject,
at least in principle, to empirical testing. And nothing in cost-benefit
analysis would prevent people from devoting resources to projects that they
consider worthy, even if the risk is relatively low as a statistical matter.
I have not yet discussed what cost-benefit analysis specifically entails,
and there are potentially serious controversies here. But it will be best to
discuss that question after dealing with some direct objections.

III. Objections: Populism, Quantification,
and Rival Rationalities

The argument made thus far runs into three obvious objections. The first
involves democratic considerations; the second points to the limitations of
quantification; the third raises the possibility that ordinary people’s judgments
are based not on cognitive limitations but on a kind of ‘‘rival rationality.’’A.
Populism

The first objection, populist in character, is captured by the opening quotation
from Senator Biden. The objection would be that in a democracy,
government properly responds to the social demand for law. Government
does not legitimately reject that demand on the ground that cost-benefit
analysis suggests that it should not act. Any approach that uses efficiency,
or technocratically driven judgments, as a brake on accountability is fatally
undemocratic.

45 See Morgenstern ed., supra note 42. See also Richard Elliot Benedick, Ozone Diplomacy:
New Directions in Safeguarding the Planet 63 (1991) (Reagan administration supported
aggressive regulation largely because cost-benefit analysis from the Council of Economic
Advisers demonstrated that ‘‘despite the scientific and economic uncertainties, the
monetary benefits of preventing future deaths from skin cancer far outweighed costs of CFC
controls as estimated either by industry or by EPA’’).

1074 THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

The problem with this objection is that it rests on a controversial and
even unacceptable conception of democracy, one that sees responsiveness
to citizens’ demands, whatever their factual basis, as the foundation of political
legitimacy. If those demands are uninformed, it is perfectly appropriate
for government to resist them. Indeed, it is far from clear that reasonable
citizens want, or would want, their government to respond to their
uninformed demands.
The analysis thus far suggests that the relevant demands are, in fact, uninformed
or unreflective. If this is so, they should be subject to deliberative
constraints of the sort exemplified by cost-benefit analysis. After that analysis
has been generated, and public officials have taken it into account, democratic
safeguards continue to be available, and electoral sanctions can be
imposed on those who have violated the public will. The simple point is
that if, once informed if the cost-benefit trade-off, people continue to seek
some particular regulation, then democratic considerations require government
to respect their choice.46 At the very least, cost-benefit analysis should
be an ingredient in the analysis, showing people that the consequences of
various approaches might be different from what they seem.

B. Quantification and Expressive Rationality

I have noted that the cost-benefit chart (Table 1) described above raised
many questions. Those questions might be made into a thoroughgoing challenge
to cost-benefit analysis. In an extensive discussion, Lisa Heinzerling
has attempted to do precisely that.47 Heinzerling argues that many of the
values depend on controversial judgments of value and that the table itself
masks those judgments. Her first point is that the table includes many regulations
that were in fact rejected. Some of them were not issued on the
ground that their costs would exceed their benefits. The table is also underinclusive,
for many regulations have been issued that impose dramatically
lower costs than many of those included on the table. But by itself this is
no indictment of cost-benefit analysis. Indeed, it provides support for costbenefit
analysis insofar as it suggests that the tool has resulted in a rejection
of undesirable regulations.
But Heinzerling goes further. She contends that many of these numbers
depend on controversial judgments about how to discount future benefits.
Above all, the charts depend on a 10 percent discount rate, whereas the
agencies tended to use a lower discount rate or not to discount at all. Heinz46
At least assuming the decisions involve nothing peculiar or invidious, such as racial
animus. 47 See Heinzerling, supra note 8. Heinzerling’s alternative table appears in id. at 2040 n.397.

erling also suggests that the charts depend on downward adjustment of the
agency’s estimates of risk. Her own estimates result in Table 3, adjusted
for inflation.
This table may be more accurate than Table 1; certainly there are problems
with any approach that assumes a 10 percent discount rate. But even
if Heinzerling’s table is better, it offers an ironic lesson, serving largely to
confirm the point that current regulatory policy suffers from poor priority
setting. The disparities here are not as dramatic, and they certainly do not
establish pervasive overregulation; but they do support the view that resources
are being misallocated.
Heinzerling does not, however, conclude that this revised table is the appropriate
basis for evaluating regulatory policy. Her aim is not to come up
with a better table from which to reassess government behavior. On the
contrary, she takes her argument to be a basis for rejecting cost-benefit analysis
altogether. This, then, is a lesson about ‘‘the perils of precision.’’48
Heinzerling also suggests that it ‘‘would be better if we left the picture
blurry, and declined to connect the dots between all the confusing and
sometimes conflicting intuitions and evidence.’’49 She is concerned that
‘‘some, probably many, people will be fooled into believing that numerical

estimates of risks, costs, and benefits are impartial reflections of factual reality,
in which case the likely result of increased reliance on quantification
in setting regulatory policy will be that the side that best obscures the value
choices implicit in its numbers will prevail.’’50
There is considerable truth here; but I think that Heinzerling’s lesson is
greatly overdrawn. Truth first: If an agency says that the cost of regulation
is $100 million, and the benefit $70 million, we still know much less than
we should. It is important to know who bears these costs and, if possible,
with what consequences. Will wages be lower? Whose wages? Will prices
be higher? Of what products? A disaggregated picture of the benefits would
also be important; what does the $70 million figure represent? Consider, for
example, a recent table explaining that the costs of skin cancer, from health
effects of reducing tropospheric ozone, are between $290 million and $1.1
billion, with dollar subtotals for skin cancers and cataracts.51 By itself, this
table is insufficiently informative to tell people what they need to know.
Heinzerling is therefore on firm ground if she means to suggest that the
dollar numbers cannot substitute for a fuller inquiry into what is at stake.
Any cost-benefit analysis should include more than the monetary values by,
for example, showing what the values are about, such as life-years saved
and illnesses averted (see the Appendix for illustrations). But her own table
suggests that the general conclusion—that cost-benefit analysis can illuminate
inquiry—remains unassailable. If regulation ranges from tens of thousands
of dollars to tens of millions of dollars per life saved, at least there
is a presumptive problem. One of the functions of cost-benefit balancing is
to help show where limited resources should go. A regulation of particulates
is hard to evaluate without knowing, for example, the number of
deaths averted and the range of consequences for morbidity: How many
workdays will be saved that would otherwise be lost? How many hospitalizations
will be avoided? How many asthma attacks will be prevented?
It could even be useful to attempt to describe these effects in terms of
‘‘quality-adjusted life-years,’’52 knowing that here, too, a good analyst will
go back and forth between bottom lines and the judgments that go into their
creation.
I suspect that there may be theoretical claims behind Heinzerling’s skepticism
about quantification. She may believe that many of the goods at stake

that a previous table in their essay describes adverse health effects in quantitative terms by

in regulation (human and animal life and health, recreational and aesthetic
opportunities) are not merely commodities, that people do not value these
goods in the same way that they value cash, and that cost-benefit analysis,
with its reductionism, is inconsistent with people’s reflective judgments
about the issues at stake. Arguments of this sort have been developed in
some philosophical challenges to cost-benefit analysis.53
Such arguments are convincing if cost-benefit analysis is taken to suggest
a controversial position in favor of the commensurability of all goods—
if cost-benefit analysts are seen to insist that people value environmental
amenities, or their own lives, in the same way that they value a bank account,
or if cost-benefit analysis is taken as a metaphysical claim to the effect
that all goods can be aligned along a single metric, or as if five lives
saved is seen as the same, in some deep sense, as $20–$30 million saved.
Part of what people express, in their daily lives, is a resistance to this form
of commensurability; some goods are believed to have intrinsic as well as
instrumental value.54
The existence of qualitative differences among goods fortifies the claim
that any bottom line about costs and benefits should be supplemented with
a more qualitative description of the variables involved. But cost-benefit
analysis should not be seen as embodying a reductionist account of the
good, and much less as a suggestion that everything is simply a commodity
for human use. It is best taken as pragmatic instrument, agnostic on the
deep issues and designed to assist people in making complex judgments
where multiple goods are involved. To put it another way, cost-benefit analysis
might be assessed pragmatically, or even politically, rather than metaphysically.We
should conclude that the final number may provide less information
than the ingredients that went into it and that officials should present costbenefit
analysis in sufficiently full terms to enable people to have a concrete
sense of the effects of regulation. This is an argument against some overambitious
understandings of what cost-benefit balancing entails. But it is not
an argument against cost-benefit balancing.

C. Rival Rationalities

The final objection to the discussion thus far is the most fundamental. On
this view, cost-benefit analysis is not desirable as a check on ordinary intuitions,
because those intuitions reflect a kind of rival rationality. Ordinary
people have a complex understanding of what it is that they want to max53

imize. They do not simply tabulate lives saved; they ask questions as well
about whether the relevant risk is controllable, voluntary, dreaded, equitably
distributed, and potentially catastrophic. Consider Table 4.
Some people suggest that to the extent that ordinary people disagree with
experts, they have a ‘‘thicker’’ or ‘‘richer’’ rationality and that democracy
should respect their judgments.55 On a more moderate view, government’s
task is to distinguish between lay judgments that are products of factual
mistakes (produced, for example, by the availability heuristic) and lay judgments
that are products of judgments of value (as in the view that voluntarily
incurred risks deserve less attention than involuntarily incurred
ones).56 In any case the ‘‘psychometric paradigm’’ is designed show how
ordinary people’s judgments are responsive to an array of factors other than
lives saved.57
One problem with this view is that it may not be a criticism of costbenefit
analysis at all; it may suggest only that any judgment about benefits
and costs (whether or not based on willingness to pay) will have to take
account of people’s divergent assessments of divergent risks. In principle,
there is no problem with doing exactly that. There is, however, reason to
question the now-conventional view that qualitative factors of this kind in

Perspective, in Regulatory Policy and the Social Sciences 241 (Roger G. Noll ed.

COGNITION AND CBA 1079

fact explain people’s disagreement with experts about certain risks of death.
In fact, I do not believe that the psychometric paradigm can defend its own
central claims. The first point is technical. In the relevant studies, the key
factors—voluntariness, controllability, potentially catastrophic nature—
have usually not been generated spontaneously or independently by subjects.
Instead, those who conduct the relevant research ask people to rank
risks along these dimensions. From this information it cannot be said that
ordinary people think that these qualitative differences justify departing
from the lives-saved criterion. The evidence is simply too indirect.
Now this does not mean that the rival rationalities view is wrong. There
is independent evidence to suggest that people consider some deaths to be
worse than others.58 They are apparently willing to pay more, for example,
to prevent a cancer death than to prevent an unforeseen instant death, and
there is some evidence that voluntarily incurred risks receive less social
concern than risks that are involuntarily incurred. Distributional judgments
also appear to play some role in assessments about how to allocate scarce
resources. But these points raise further questions.59
No doubt it is possible that people’s judgments about risk severity are a
product of some of the more qualitative considerations listed above; this
idea leads to the widespread view that ordinary people have a richer rationality
than do experts, since ordinary people look at the nature and causes
of death, not simply at aggregate deaths at issue. But it is also possible that
an apparently rich judgment that a certain risk is severe, or not severe, depends
not on well-considered judgments of value, but instead on an absence
of ordinary contextual cues, on a failure to see that trade-offs are inevitably
being made, on heuristic devices that are not well adapted to the particular
context, or instead on a range of confusing or confused ideas that people
cannot fully articulate. When people say, for example, that the risk of nuclear
power is very serious, they may be responding to their intense visceral
concern, possibly based on (uninformed) statistical judgments about likely
lives at risk and on their failure to see (as they do in other contexts) that
the risk is accompanied by a range of social benefits. Thus it is possible
that a judgment that a certain risk of death is unusually bad is not a rich
qualitative assessment but an (unreliable) intuition based on a rapid balancing
that prominently includes perceived lives at stake and the perceived
presence of small or no benefits associated with the risk-producing activity.
Thus the question becomes whether citizen judgments that certain deaths

58 Some of the data are collected in Cass R. Sunstein, Bad Deaths, 14 J. Risk & Uncertainty
259 (1997). 59 I draw in the next several paragraphs from id.; Margolis, supra note 26, contains an
excellent discussion of this point, from which I have learned a great deal.

1080 THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

are especially bad can survive a process of reflection. My conclusion is that
understood in a certain way, the notions of dreaded deaths and unfairly distributed
deaths are fully reasonable and deserve a role in policy. But the
special concerns about deaths stemming from involuntarily run and uncontrollable
risks raise serious doubts; as frequently invoked, they do not justify
according additional concern to deaths that ‘‘code’’ as a product of involuntary
or uncontrollable risks. At most, they suggest that government
might spend more resources on deaths where the cost of risk avoidance is
especially high and devote less attention to deaths where the cost of risk
avoidance is especially low.60

1. Dread

It is often said, on the basis of evidence like that outlined above, that
especially dreaded deaths deserve special attention. Deaths from cancer and
AIDS fall in this category. The underlying point is probably that the relevant
deaths are especially grueling and hence there is a kind of ‘‘pain and
suffering premium’’—not merely a life lost, but an antecedent period of
intense emotional and physical difficulty as well. This period of intense difficulty
might impose costs on those with the illness and on friends and family
members as well. Sudden, unanticipated deaths can be dreaded too—
consider the extremely unpleasant idea of dying in an airplane crash. But
the dread here stems from some factor (perhaps terror) different from and
much shorter than the extended period of suffering that precedes some
deaths. Thus it might be concluded that dreaded deaths deserve special attention
in accordance with the degree of suffering that precedes them. A
special problem with cancer deaths is that at least some of the time, people
like to have upward-sloping utility. It is particularly bad to be in a situation
in which things will constantly get worse.61 With cancer deaths, the slope
goes downward fairly consistently until the point of death.

2. Voluntariness

People seem to perceive voluntarily incurred risks as less troublesome
than involuntarily incurred risks. Consider diverse public reactions to airplane
crashes and automobile crashes. Or consider the fact that tobacco is
by far the largest source of preventable deaths in the United States. Why
have we until recently not devoted much more of our regulatory effort to

reducing smoking? The reason seems to lie in a judgment that smoking is
a voluntary activity, and hence the resulting deaths are less troublesome
than other sorts of deaths. Here—it might be said—people have voluntarily
assumed the relevant risks.
Puzzles: High Cost of Avoidance Rather than Involuntariness? A simple
reference to voluntariness, if taken to suggest something special about
‘‘lay rationality,’’ raises many puzzles. The most important problem is that
it is not simple to know when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Voluntariness
may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an
asteroid; but voluntariness is not, in the cases under consideration, an allor-nothing
matter. Instead, it is a matter of degree. Return to the conventional
thought that airplane crashes are involuntary and automobile crashes
more voluntary. Certainly it would be possible to see the risks from air
travel as voluntarily run; people have a choice about whether to fly, and
when they do fly, they pay a certain amount for a certain package, including
risks of various sorts. The same is true of automobile safety—and it is not
in any way less true, however disparate the two kinds of risks may seem.
Perhaps people are responding to the perceived fact that they have no control
over the pilot’s behavior, whereas they have considerable control over
automobile safety if they are themselves drivers. But airlines respond to
market forces, including the market for safety, and many people injured in
automobile accidents are not at fault. The difference between the two risks
is hardly so categorical as to justify an assessment that they fall on poles
of some voluntariness-involuntariness divide. Indeed, it is not clear even
what is meant by the suggestion that one is voluntary and the other is not.
Something else appears to underlie that suggestion.
Three Cases. To shed some light on the issue, let us consider three
classes of cases. First, consider the question whether workers exposed to
cancer risks are voluntarily or involuntarily so exposed. If workers do not
know about such risks—if they lack relevant information—we seem to
have an easy case of involuntariness. Thus it makes sense to say that risks
are run involuntarily when the people running them do not know about
them. Lack of adequate information provides a legitimate basis for a judgment
of involuntary exposure to risk. But of course information itself can
be obtained at some cost, pecuniary or otherwise. We are thus dealing, in
cases of this kind, with high costs of risk avoidance, in the distinctive form
of high costs of acquiring relevant information.
Second, suppose that people who are exposed to a certain risk are aware
of the risk but are not in an actual or potential contractual relation with the
risk producer. Many victims of pollution are in this position; recall that in
surveys air pollution is a particular source of public concern. People in Los
Angeles may well know that they face high levels of smog. Are they exThis

posed involuntarily? If we conclude that they are, we may mean that a risk
is incurred involuntarily in the sense that it is typically very expensive for
people to avoid it—and when someone else can reduce the risks more
cheaply. Here a claim that the risk is faced ‘‘involuntarily’’ may mean that
those who run the risk can reduce it only at very high cost, at least compared
to those who produce the risk. (The quotation marks are necessary
for obvious Coasean reasons.) Or it is possible that we mean that on nonutilitarian
grounds, the people exposed to the risk have a moral entitlement
to be free from it, at least if they have not explicitly sold it.
But turn now to a third class of cases, involving a wage package or contract
that does include compensation for the relevant risks. Assuming that
point, we might want to distinguish between two different possibilities. In
a case of a high-level scientist, knowledgeable about relevant risks and involved
in work that he finds rewarding, people may well conclude that we
have an instance of voluntariness. (In the same category can be found the
case of an astronaut.) But people might not say the same about a low-level
worker who does not like his work at all.62 What distinguishes the two
cases? If knowledge is present, or if the compensation package includes
payment for the relevant risk, it is not clear how the two differ. The underlying
judgment must be that the compensation is inadequate, perhaps because
background inequality has produced a wage package that seems unfair
even if voluntarily chosen by the parties.
From this discussion it seems reasonable to speculate that any judgment
that a risk is run ‘‘involuntarily’’ is probably based on (1) a lack of knowledge
of the risk or, more accurately, high costs of obtaining information
about the risk; (2) a belief that, information to one side, it would be very
costly for people to avoid the risk; or (3) a belief that the risk is unaccompanied
by compensating benefits, notwithstanding their belief that the contract
is in some sense worth signing. It may seem hard to make sense of point
3; what might be at work is a judgment that background inequalities are
producing the relevant bargain (not by itself a good reason to disrupt the
deal), or perhaps a belief that workers are competing to their collective detriment,
and an agreement not to compete would be in their best interests.
On this view, the question whether a risk is run voluntarily or not is often
not a categorical one but instead a question of degree, associated with information
cost, risk-reduction cost, and the existence or not of accompanying
benefits. Of course there are interesting background questions about why
and when a risk codes as voluntary or involuntary; undoubtedly the answer
depends a great deal on heuristic devices and selective attention.

The Purpose for Which the Risk Is Incurred and Problems of Responsibility
and Blame. Death risks may seem voluntarily run when people do
not approve of the purpose for which people run the relevant risks, and involuntarily
run when people think that the purpose for which the risk is run
is laudable. It is predictable that people will not want to pour enormous
taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even
if the dollars/life-years saved ratio is quite good. By contrast, it is doubtful
that people think that it is wrong to spend enormous resources on the prevention
of death from childbirth or being a police officer, even though the
decision to have a child is (with appropriate qualifications) voluntary, and
so too with the decision to become a police officer. People may think that
when the appeal or purpose of the activity is associated with its very riskiness,
resources should not be devoted to risk reduction. At least this is plausible
when the risk is an independent good or part of the benefit of the activity.
And it is easy to imagine a belief that some activities—unsafe sex,
cigarette smoking—are like the skydiving case, perhaps because the risk is
sometimes part of the benefit, perhaps because the risks are not incurred for
a purpose that observers find worthy or valuable.
It might seem that this consideration—the purpose for which the risk is
incurred—overlaps with or is even identical to the question whether there
are high costs of risk avoidance. When the costs are low, as in skydiving,
the purpose might seem inadequate. But on reflection the two ideas are
hardly the same. It may well be that failing to sky dive, or skydiving with
some safety-increasing technology, imposes high costs on sky divers. There
seems to be an objective judgment, not necessarily connected with subjective
costs, in the claim that some risks are voluntary, or deserve less attention,
because they are run for inadequate purposes.
Relatedly, airplane accidents may seem different from automobile accidents
not because the former are less voluntary, and not because of diverse
costs of risk avoidance, but because the victims of airplane accidents are
less blameworthy than the victims of automobile accidents, in the sense that
the death is not a product of their own negligence or misconduct. In the
case of an airplane disaster, weather conditions, mechanical failure, or pilot
error are likely causes; in the case of an automobile accident, it is more
likely (though not of course certain) that the victim could have avoided
death through more careful driving. The point is crude, since many victims
of automobile accidents are not drivers and many drivers in accidents do
not behave negligently. But the perceived difference, in a significant number
of cases, may underlie an apparent judgment of voluntariness that is
really a judgment about responsibility and blameworthiness. In any case
judgments are likely to be affected, and distorted, by the fact that drivers
seem to be risk optimists—with 90 percent ranking themselves as safer than

the average driver and less likely to be involved in an accident.63 This is
another place—illusions of control and risk optimism—where cognitive
psychology argues in favor of cost-benefit analysis.
Underlying Questions and Assumption of Risk. We might therefore
conclude that whether a risk qualifies as involuntary raises many of the
questions raised by the question whether government should regulate the
market at all. A risk might be characterized as involuntarily run because
affected people lack relevant information, because the transactions costs of
bargaining are high, because the risks should be seen to amount to externalities,
because collective action problems make market outcomes unsatisfactory
since (for example) workers are in a Prisoner’s Dilemma best solved
through law, or because some motivational or cognitive defect makes successful
solutions through markets unlikely. These of course are among the
conventional grounds for regulation in the first instance. When a risk seems
voluntary, and not worthy of substantial regulatory resources, the term
‘‘voluntary’’ is serving as a placeholder for an argument that there is no
sufficient ground for government action, because the accompanying benefits
are high or the risk-reduction costs are low, and because market arrangements
take adequate account of these facts.
Should voluntarily run risks of death receive no public attention, on the
ground that the relevant people have already received compensation? We
might imagine a death risk to be incurred voluntarily when an informed person
decides to incur it in light of its costs and benefits. Suppose, for example,
that someone purchases a small car with fewer safety features, or decides
to become a boxer, an astronaut, or a police officer in a dangerous
neighborhood. If a death results from such a choice, it might seem that the
chooser has no legitimate ground for complaint; there has been ex ante
compensation for the risk. But even in such cases, it is not clear that government
lacks a role. If government can reduce a serious risk at low cost,
and thus eliminate deaths, it should do so even if there was ex ante compensation
for the relevant risk. There is a general point here. Sometimes observers
confuse two quite different questions: (1) Should people be banned
from running a certain risk, when they have run that risk voluntarily? (2)
Should government attempt to reduce a certain risk, when people have run
that risk voluntarily? A negative answer to question 1 does not answer
question 2.
From this point we should conclude that a lay judgment that a risk is
‘‘voluntary’’ should not be decisive. A better understanding of what factors
underlie and support that judgment should be used in regulatory policy.

3. Ripple Effects

The psychological evidence suggests, though it does not fully elaborate,
an important and relevant fact: Some deaths produce unusually high externalities,
in the sense that they generate widespread losses, including those
stemming from empathy and fear, in a way that leads to predictable pecuniary
and nonpecuniary costs. Consider, for example, the death of the president
of the United States, a death that imposes a wide range of costs and
that taxpayers invest significant resources to prevent. Part of the reason for
allocating those resources is undoubtedly the greater risk that the president
will be murdered; but the external costs associated with his death are undoubtedly
important too. A parallel can be found in the relatively large level
of resources devoted to prevent the assassination of many important public
officials. But the point is hardly limited to the highest public officials. An
airplane hijacking or crash, partly because it is likely to be well publicized,
may produce large externalities in the form of empathy and fear. It may
even deter air travel by making people unusually frightened of airplanes,
simply because of heuristic devices (availability) and other predictable factors
that make people’s probability assessments go awry. This fear may be
damaging because it is itself a utility loss and because it may lead people
to use less safe methods of transportation, such as automobiles. Or an airplane
crash might be especially disturbing because the sudden loss of dozens
or hundreds of people seems so unusually and senselessly tragic, in a
way that produces large empathetic reactions, or because it signals the further
possibility of random, apparently inexplicable events in which large
numbers of people die.
Special public concern about catastrophic events may reflect a judgment
that certain kinds of deaths have ancillary effects, well beyond the deaths
themselves. Consider in this regard the ‘‘Buffalo Creek Syndrome,’’ documented
several times in the aftermath of major disasters. Nearly 2 years
after the collapse of a dam that left 120 dead and 4,000 homeless, psychiatric
researchers continued to find significant psychological and sociological
changes; survivors were characterized by a loss of direction and energy,
other disabling character changes, and a loss of communality.64 One evaluator
attributed this loss of direction specifically to ‘‘the loss of traditional
bonds of kinship and neighborliness.’’65
These various points raise a number of questions. We do not yet have a

full understanding of the basis for special public concern with catastrophes.
Moreover, the argument for devoting special resources to deaths with externalities
is strongest when the externalities do not reflect irrationality or cannot
be reduced through other means. For example, some of the fear that
follows certain widely reported deaths is based on confusion or ignorance
about actual probabilities; if it is possible to dispel the confusion, the fear
should dissipate as well. Here the question is whether government can legitimately
spend extra resources to avert the harms associated with irrational
public attitudes. Perhaps information-based strategies would be preferable
to allocating additional resources to deaths whose occurrence produces
widespread panic. On the other hand, there are undoubtedly instances in
which information is ineffective, and there are also cases in which high externalities,
in the form of special fear, are not a product of factual ignorance.
In such cases government is justified in giving additional resources
to death prevention.

4. Inequitable Distribution

Some risks might be, or be thought to be, inequitably distributed, above
all because the victims are disproportionately members of socially disadvantaged
groups. Certain deaths might, for example, be concentrated among
poor people, African-Americans, or homosexuals. Consider the risk of lead
paint poisoning suffered by inner-city children, or the risk of AIDS, faced
disproportionately by African-Americans as well as homosexuals. Citizens
or elected representatives may think that inequitably distributed risks of
death deserve special attention from government.
When such social concern exists, and when it is not objectionable on
constitutional or other grounds, it is entirely legitimate for officials to respond.66
Thus regulators should be permitted to use a uniform number per
life or life-years saved; this is itself a (modest) redistributive strategy, because
wealthy people (simply because they are wealthy) are willing to pay
more to reduce risks than nonwealthy people. Regulators might also be permitted
to give distributional weights to risks whose distributional incidence
is especially troublesome.67 These weights might take a technical form
(through adding numbers to the ones that would otherwise be used) or appear
via the official judgment about how to proceed after the cost-benefit

66 It is inadequate to respond that potential compensation could be made to losers in the
context of efficient programs; if the compensation is only potential, the concern remains. 67 See the critical comments about willingness to pay in Sen, The Discipline of CostBenefit
Analysis, supra note 5, and in Adler & Posner, Implementing Cost-Benefit Analysis,
supra note 5.

COGNITION AND CBA 1087

analysis has been supplied (through deciding in favor of a strategy not
strictly suggested by the numbers). The distributional concern supports special
efforts to control AIDS; environmental risks like asthma, which are
concentrated among inner-city children; and perhaps the spread of diseases
whose incidence is concentrated among women. My minimal claim is that
if there is a public judgment in favor of according a distributional weight
to a certain death-reduction policy, and if that judgment is not unconstitutional
or otherwise illegitimate, policy makers should not be barred from
respecting that judgment.

5. No Rival Rationality

I conclude that there is no rival rationality and that people are willing to
depart from the lives-saved criterion for reasons that cast a clearer light on
what it is that they are attempting to maximize. More particularly, I suggest
the following:
People Are Willing to Pay a Premium to Avoid Deaths That Involve a
High Degree of Pain and Suffering. At least presumptively, this desire, or
judgment, should be respected by government regulators; the presumption
might be rebutted if, for example, the premium seems so high as to suggest
that some kind of irrationality is at work.
People Are Willing to Devote More Resources to Protect Children.
This judgment may depend on a belief that children are typically
more vulnerable to risk, in the sense that they cannot protect themselves,
or on a belief that more life-years are at stake when children are in jeopardy.
In either case, this judgment too deserves respect.
People Are Willing to Pay a Premium to Avert Catastrophes. This may
depend on a belief that catastrophes have ripple effects that outrun lives
actually lost. A plane crash killing 100 people may be worse than 100
deaths from poor diet, if the consequence of the former is to create pervasive
fear and anxiety. A shooting in a high school may warrant special attention,
keeping lives saved constant, if only in order to ensure that students
and parents are not constantly fearful about the safety of schools. These
ripple effects qualify as social costs and at first glance seem to deserve special
attention. The major qualification is that it may be possible to address
them directly, rather than to cater (pander?) to them. Suppose, for example,
that education can assure the public that flying is generally quite safe. If
information can accomplish this end, it is better to provide it than to engage
in regulation that is costly and that has no purpose other than to reassure.
People Are Willing to Devote More Resources to Protect against Dangers
When the Costs of Risk Avoidance Are High. Perhaps people do not
have information about certain risks, and perhaps information is costly to

1088 THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

obtain. Perhaps third parties are in danger, and perhaps it is costly for them
to avoid the danger. This point may involve fairness; it may involve efficiency.
It involves fairness if people believe that those who bear high costs
from risk avoidance should not, in principle, have to bear those costs. If
this is the underlying belief, then it may follow that those who can easily
avoid the cost of some risk should, in principle, do exactly that. The point
involves efficiency if the judgment is that the best means of reducing aggregate
costs (public as well as private) is to regulate the entity that is imposing
the relevant risk.
People May Believe That It Is Especially Important to Protect Vulnerable
or Traditionally Disadvantaged Groups against Certain Risks. If, for example,
AIDS is concentrated among African-Americans and homosexuals,
there may be a special reason to devote resources to its prevention, even if
quantitatively identical risks receive less attention.
These various points suggest that there is no rival rationality. The question
is whether people believe that some dangers deserve more attention
than (quantitatively identical) others and, if so, whether that belief can survive
critical scrutiny. But these points also suggest that it is wrong to think
that policy should follow the judgments of experts focused on the single
question of ‘‘lives at stake.’’68 This is not the social maximand for reflective
citizens. Such citizens have a different view about what their government
ought to be doing. That different view does not embody any exotic conception
of rationality.

IV. An Incompletely Theorized Agreement
on Cost-Benefit Analysis?

A. Problems with Aggregated Willingness to Pay

Thus far I have suggested that cost-benefit analysis is a sensible approach
to cognitive problems faced by ordinary people in the assessment of risk.
I have also suggested that there is no democratic objection to using costbenefit
analysis as an ingredient in decisions, even a crucial ingredient, and
that cost-benefit analysis can be understood in a way that responds to reasonable
concerns about quantification and about the idea that the only thing
to be maximized is total lives saved (or, somewhat better, life-years saved).
But none of this deals with the general question how cost-benefit analysis
should be understood. In the least contentious formulation—the formula68
This is the apparent recommendation in Margolis, supra note 26.

This content downloaded from 147.26.11.80 on Sun, 12 May 2013 06:27:46 AM

COGNITION AND CBA 1089

tion that I have used here—cost-benefit analysis is simply a form of openended
consequentialism, an invitation to identify the advantages and disadvantages
of regulation,69 without saying anything about appropriate weights.
The virtue of this formulation is that it is uncontentious; the vice is that it
is vacuous. People can agree with it, but it does not mean anything. In its
most contentious formulation, cost-benefit analysis depends on asking people
how much they are willing to pay for various goods and making decisions
depend on the resulting numbers.70 Problems with this approach lie in
a possible lack of private information, possible distributional unfairness
(since willingness to pay depends on ability to pay), potential differences
between private willingness to pay and public aspirations,71 and collective
action problems of various sorts that might draw into doubt the privately
expressed amounts.72 It will be worthwhile to spell out these points in a bit
more detail.
Willingness to pay is a simple way to capture people’s valuations, and
for this reason it has practical advantages. Indeed, it is a good place to start,
especially in the absence of anything better. But it also suffers from several
problems. First, willingness to pay may be a product of cognitive and motivational
distortions of various kinds. Willingness-to-pay judgments may be
insufficiently informed or reflective with respect to both facts and values.
For example, people may overstate the risks that receive disproportionate
media attention. If this is so, it seems odd to base government policy on
those judgments. It is also possible that people will be willing to pay little
to avoid some bad X simply because they are used to it and their preferences
have adapted accordingly.73 Preferences based on lack of information
or adaptation to deprivation are hardly a good basis for regulatory policy.
They need not be taken as given and translated into law. In any case, private
preferences may be a product of social norms over which individuals have
little control, by which they live, but which they would like to change if
they could. If people are willing to pay little to avoid some risk (for example,
of smoking) because of prevailing norms that they would wish

69 See Sen, The Discipline of Cost-Benefit Analysis, supra note 5; compare the notion of
cost-benefit analysis as a decision procedure in Adler & Posner, Rethinking Cost-Benefit
Analysis, supra note 5. 70 See Richard A. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law (5th ed. 1998). 71 See Daphna Lewinsohn-Zamir, Consumer Preferences, Citizen Preferences, and the Provision
of Public Goods, 108 Yale L. J. 377 (1999); Sunstein, supra note 5, ch. 2. 72 See Lewinsohn-Zamir, supra note 71; Amartya Sen, Environmental Evaluation and Social
Choice: Contingent Valuation and the Market Analogy, 46 Japanese Econ. Rev. 23, 29
(1995). 73 See Jon Elster, Sour Grapes: Studies in the Subversion of Rationality (1983).

1090 THE JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES

changed, willingness to pay is unjustified as a basis for policy, since the
norm could be changed through collective action.74
Second, willingness to pay is imperfectly correlated with utility; at best
the first is a proxy for the second, and the two should not be confused in
principle. Poor people are willing to pay less than wealthy people simply
by virtue of being poor, and their willingness to pay for something (for example,
a reduced mortality risk) is crudely connected with the utility that
they would gain from it. In the face of disparities in wealth, willingness to
pay should not be identified with expected utility or with the value actually
placed on the good in question.75
Third, there is a purely distributive concern.76 Because poor people have
less money than wealthy people, they are willing to pay less for equivalent
goods (such as reduced risks to life). The result of the use of willingness
to pay would be to produce greater expenditures to protect wealthy people
than poor people, a controversial result to say the least.77
Fourth, the willingness-to-pay criterion will produce losers as well as
winners, and many of the losers will go uncompensated; it is scant comfort
to say that they could be compensated with side payments or a system of
optimal taxation. Hence an attempt to defend cost-benefit analysis by reference
to the efficiency criterion, as measured by private willingness to pay,
runs into great difficulties, at least unless steps are taken to ensure against
distributional bias.78
Fifth, and finally, there may be differences between the choices people
make as consumers and the choices that they make as citizens, and it is not
clear that the former should be preferred. The context of citizenship may
evoke other-regarding or altruistic values that are not reflected in private
choices. This is partly because aggregating private willingness to pay can

74 See Sunstein, supra note 5, ch. 2. 75 This seems to me a mistake in Viscusi’s illuminating discussion: Viscusi, Risk Equity,
supra note 2. 76 This is a standard point in economic discussions of cost-benefit analysis, though it is
ignored in many discussions by economic analysts of law. See, for example, Richard W.
Tresch, Public Finance: A Normative Theory 541 (1981): ‘‘In our opinion the distributive
question is the single most important issue in all of cost-benefit analysis.’’ Tresch discusses
how distributional considerations might be incorporated. See also A. Allan Schmid, BenefitCost
Analysis 157–90 (1989), with a discussion of distributive weights at 170–72. 77 At least unless poor people are compensated for any losses via side payments. 78 There are some complexities here. Of course markets are ordinarily based on willingness
to pay, and poor people are willing to pay less for safety, simply because they have
less. Poor people are willing to pay less, as a class and other things equal, for safer cars,
safer neighborhoods, and so forth. The aggregated willingness-to-pay approach simply generalizes
this phenomenon; there is nothing unusual about it. Thus a system that assigns uniform
values to life embeds a kind of subsidy to people with relatively less resources or, more
precisely, to people with less willingness to pay.

COGNITION AND CBA 1091

replicate various collective action problems faced in the private domain;
people may be willing to pay more simply because they know that other
people are contributing as well.79 If this is so, it makes no sense to base
policy on private willingness to pay, where the collective action problem
arises.
In any case we might think that government policy should be based on
the reasons given for one or another outcome, and the fact that people are
willing to pay a lot or a little for some outcome tells us too little about
whether good reasons exist. Before discussion, for example, people may be
willing to pay a fair bit to discriminate on the basis of sex, and they may
be willing to pay little to protect large populations of animals that are at
risk. These judgments may change as a result of reason giving in the public
domain. In other words, government is a place for exchanging reasons for
one or another course or action. It is not simply a maximizing machine,
taking private willingness to pay as the foundation, whatever the source or
the grounds of prediscussion preferences.
A particular problem here is that people may not want to spend a great
deal to protect (for example) environmental amenities because they seek to
protect their (relative) financial position.80 A regulatory program supported
by all might maintain relative position, which may be what people care
about. Current willingness-to-pay numbers do not take account of this possibility.
We have an empirical speculation here, one that suggests that current
numbers are far too low. Much further work remains to be done to test
whether people would in fact be willing to spend more for safety, or for
environmental amenities, if the result would be significant decreases in absolute
income but the same relative income.
Nor would it be sensible to disregard the presence of tragic choices, as
when cost-benefit analysis leads to a choice of course A over course B, but
course A leads to uncompensated losers (a group whose members may suffer
from serious illnesses and even death).81 Perhaps it is possible, in such
cases, to restructure social arrangements so as to reduce or eliminate the
tragedy. But even if this is so, a cost-benefit analysis, of the sort to be described,
can help inform a decision about what tragedy-reducing course to
take and whether such a course is worthwhile at all.

B. Incomplete Theorization: Cost-Benefit Analysis
as Political, Not Metaphysical

Often it is possible to resolve hard questions of law and policy without
resolving deeply contested issues about justice, democracy, or the appropriate
aims of the state.82 Often it is possible to obtain an incompletely theorized
agreement on a social practice. In many areas of law and public policy,
people can reach closure about what to do despite their disagreement
or uncertainty about why, exactly, they ought to do it. Thus people who
disagree about the purposes of the criminal law can agree that rape and
murder should be punished, and punished more severely than theft and trespass.
Thus people can support an Endangered Species Act amidst disagreement
about whether the protection of endangered species is desirable for
theological reasons, or because of the rights of animals, plants, and species,
or because of the value of animals, plants, and species for human beings.
A great advantage of incompletely theorized agreements is that they allow
people of diverse views to live together on mutually advantageous terms.
An even greater advantage is that they allow people of diverse views to
show one another a high degree of both humility and mutual respect.
I believe that an incompletely theorized agreement is possible here. For
reasons just discussed, it would be difficult to obtain agreement on the view
(which seems to me implausible) that all questions of regulatory policy
should be resolved by asking how much people are willing to pay for various
social goods.83 But it should be possible for diverse people to agree on
presumptive floors and ceilings for regulatory expenditures. A great deal
can be done without confronting the hardest theoretical questions raised by
contentious specifications of cost-benefit analysis.
An obvious question here is, Who could join this incompletely theorized
agreement? Who would reject it? My principal claim is that the agreement
could be joined by a wide range of reasonable people, including utilitarians
and Kantians, perfectionist and political liberals, and those who accept and
those who doubt the idea that private willingness to pay is the appropriate
foundation for regulatory policy. There is room here for deliberative democrats
who emphasize the need for government to reflect on private preferences,
rather than simply to translate them into law.84 A prime purpose of

82 See Cass R. Sunstein, Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict (1996); Cass R. Sunstein,
One Case at a Time (1999). 83 See Adler & Posner, Rethinking Cost-Benefit Analysis, supra note 5. 84 Absolutists of various kinds might refuse to join an agreement on these principles. Perhaps
their refusal would be most reasonable in the case of the Endangered Species Act, where
nothing said below explains why millions of dollars should be spent (at least in opportunity
costs) to save members of ecologically unimportant species. It would be possible, however,
to imagine a kind of ‘‘meta’’ cost-benefit analysis that would point in this direction, perhaps

COGNITION AND CBA 1093

the approach is to ensure more in the way of reflection; cost-benefit analysis,
as understood here, is a guarantee of greater deliberation, not an obstacle
to it. Nor is the approach rigid. Under the proposed approach, agencies
have the authority to abandon the floors and ceilings if there is reason for
them to do so. If, for example, agencies want to spend a great deal to protect
African-American children from a risk disproportionately faced by
them, they are entitled to do so, as long as they explain that this is what
they are doing, and so long as what they are doing is reasonable.

C. Eight Propositions

Here, then, are eight propositions, offered in the hope that they might
attract support from diverse theoretical standpoints. I do not attempt to defend
them in detail here. The goal is to provide a starting point for the effort
to anchor cost-benefit analysis in an incompletely theorized agreement
about regulatory policies.
1. Identify and Quantify. Agencies should identify the advantages and
disadvantages of proposed courses of action and also attempt to quantify
the relevant effects to the extent that this is possible. When quantification
is not possible, agencies should discuss the relevant effects in qualitative
terms and also specify a range of plausible outcomes—for example, annual
savings of between 150 and 300 lives, or savings of between $100 million
and $300 million, depending on the rate of technological change. The statement
should include the full range of beneficial effects. The Regulatory Impact
Statement involving the EPA’s particulates and ozone regulation provides
considerable help in this regard. (See the Appendix.) The problem of
particulates and ozone regulation poses some serious difficulties to challengers
to cost-benefit analysis (CBA); if the EPA is not to do a form of
CBA, what is it to do, concretely?
2. Provide Quantitative and Qualitative Descriptions. The quantitative
description should supplement rather than displace a qualitative description
of relevant effects. Both qualitative and quantitative descriptions should be
provided. It is important to know the nature of the relevant effects—for
example, lost workdays, cancers averted, respiratory problems averted. To
the extent possible, the qualitative description should give a concrete sense
of who is helped and who is hurt—for example, whether the beneficiaries
are mostly or partly children, whether the regulation will lead to lost jobs,
higher prices, more poverty, and so forth. Where the only possible informaon
the ground that it greatly simplifies decision without imposing high costs overall. For the
regulatory issues dealt with here, an absolutist approach seems hard to justify, not least because
there are dangers to life and health on both sides of the equation.

tion is speculative, this should be noted, along with the most reasonable
speculations.
3. Convert Nonmonetary Values. Agencies should attempt to convert
nonmonetary values (involving, for example, lives saved, health gains, and
aesthetic values) into dollar equivalents. This is not because a statistical life
and (say) $5 million are the same thing, but to promote coherence and uniformity
and to ensure sensible priority setting. There is nothing magical or
rigid about the dollar equivalents; the conversion is simply a pragmatic tool
to guide analysis and to allow informed comparisons.
4. Establish Presumptive Floors and Ceilings. Agencies entrusted with
valuing life and health should be controlled, by statute or executive order,
via presumptive floors and ceilings. For example, a statute might say that a
statistical life will ordinarily be valued at no less than $2 million and no
more than $10 million. Evidence of worker and consumer behavior, suggesting
a valuation of between $5 million and $7 million per statistical life
saved, is at least relevant here. The fact that the willingness-to-pay numbers
are in this range is hardly decisive, but it is supplemented by the fact that
similar numbers appear to represent the midpoint of agency practice. Thus
both market and governmental measures point in the same basic direction.85
The Office of Management and Budget should establish presumptive floors
and ceilings for various regulatory benefits. If an agency is going to spend
(say) no more than $500,000 per life saved, or more than $20 million, it
should have to explain itself. Actual agency practice reveals a mixed record.
The EPA now values a life at $4.8 million; some agencies go as high as
$5.6 million or as low as $1 million; and some agencies do not provide
specific numbers at all.
5. Adjust Ceilings and Floors. Agencies should be permitted to adjust
the ceilings and floors, or to choose a low or high end of the range, on the
basis of a publicly articulated and reasonable judgment that such an adjustment
or such a choice is desirable. Perhaps adjustments could be made if,
for example, poor people are especially at risk. There should be no adjustments
downward for poor people; in other words, the fact that poor people
are willing to spend less to protect their own lives (because they are poor)
should not call for correspondingly lower expenditures by government. The
principal danger here is that well-organized groups will be able to use equitable
arguments on behalf of their preferred adjustments. It is important to
ensure a degree of discipline here, and perhaps the dangers of interest-group
manipulation are serious enough to suggest that uniform numbers or ranges

85 Note, however, that if relative position is what matters, these numbers may be too low,
for reasons stated above. See Frank & Sunstein, supra note 80.

COGNITION AND CBA 1095

might be used or that the presumptions are strong and rebuttable only in the
most compelling cases.86
6. Adjust According to Qualitative Factors. Agencies should be permitted
to make adjustments on the basis of the various qualitative factors
discussed above. For example, they might add a pain and suffering premium
or increase the level of expenditure because children are disproportionately
affected or because the victims are members of a disadvantaged
group. It would be reasonable to conclude that because AIDS has disproportionate
adverse effects on homosexuals and poor people, special efforts
should be made to ensure against AIDS-related deaths. To the extent possible,
agencies should be precise about the nature of, and grounds for, the
relevant adjustments, especially in light of the risk that interest-group pressures
will convert allegedly qualitative adjustments in illegitimate directions.877.
Respond to Social Fear. The appropriate response to social fear not
based on evidence, and to related ripple effects, is education and reassurance
rather than increased regulation. Sometimes public concern about certain
risks is general and intense, even though the concern is not merited by
the facts.88 The best response is educational; the government should not expend
significant resources merely because an uninformed public believes
that it should. But if education and reassurance fail, increased regulation
may be defensible as a way of providing a kind of reassurance in the face
of intense fears, which can themselves impose high costs of various kinds.
Consider, for example, the possibility that people afraid of risks of plane
crashes will shift to driving, a more risky method of transportation; consider
also the fact that the fear is itself a cost.
8. The Role of Courts. Unless the statute requires otherwise, judicial
review of risk regulation should require a general showing that regulation
has produced more good than harm, on a reasonable view about valuation
of both benefits and costs.89 On this view, courts should generally require
agencies to generate and to adhere to ceilings and floors. But they should
also allow agencies to depart from conventional numbers (by, for example,
valuing a life at less than $1 million or more than $10 million) if and only
if the agency has given a reasonable explanation of why it has done so. The

and Political Dimensions of Hazardous Waste Policy (1999) (showing that allegedly equitable
shifts are driven by political pressures not mapping onto any sensible conception of equity).

ultimate task would be develop a kind of common law of cost-benefit analysis,
authorizing agencies to be law-making institutions in the first instance.90

V. Conclusion

I have suggested that cost-benefit analysis, often defended on economic
grounds, can be urged less contentiously on cognitive grounds. Cost-benefit
analysis, taken as an inquiry into the consequences of varying approaches
to regulation,91 is a sensible response not only to interest-group power but
also to limited information and to predictable problems in the public demand
for regulation. These problems include the use of the availability heuristic;
social amplification of that heuristic via cascade effects; a failure to
see the benefits that accompany certain risks; a misunderstanding of systemic
effects, which can lead to unanticipated bad (and good) consequences;
and certain emotional reactions to risks. In all of these areas, an
effort to identify costs and benefits can properly inform analysis.
These points do not show how cost-benefit analysis should be specified.
Here I have raised questions about the willingness-to-pay criterion and suggested
that, at least in principle, it would be obtuse to attempt to assess
regulatory proposals via a uniform number for lives saved; but I have also
suggested that presumptive ranges, for life as well as other beneficial effects
on health and other values, would be an excellent way to clarify and order
regulatory policy, in a way that should lead to both greater consistency and
more overall protection. If ordinary market behavior and ordinary government
behavior point to a similar basic range (for example, $3 million to $7
million per life saved), that is an excellent place to start.
My ultimate hope is for a form of cost-benefit analysis that is a pragmatic
instrument that ought not to be terribly contentious—a form of cost-benefit
analysis that does not take a stand on highly controversial questions about
what government ought to do and that promises to attract support from people
with diverse conceptions of the right and the good. I have suggested
here that the most promising source of such an agreement is not only or
even mostly neoclassical economics, but also behavioral economics and
cognitive psychology.

90 This has started to happen in various areas. See the development of a common law of
risk significance under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, discussed in Cass
R. Sunstein, Is the Clean Air Act Unconstitutional? 98 Mich. L. Rev. 303, 352–53 n.243
(1999). 91 There is no alternative to regulation. What is sometimes described as deregulation, or a
failure to regulate, is actually regulation via the common law.
