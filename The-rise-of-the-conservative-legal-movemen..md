Acknowledgments

IN WRITING THIS BOOK, I have acquired more than the usual authorial
debts. My parents were this book’s earliest and most important patrons.
They lavishly invested in my human capital and provided a vital in-kind
subsidy to the research process—if they lived outside the Washington Beltway,
I could not have afforded my many research trips to D.C.
I drafted chapters 3 and 7 while a fellow at Princeton University’s
James Madison Program, and I owe a special debt to Professor Robert
George, an organizational entrepreneur of unusual skill as well as a true
intellectual. Yale University provided me a wonderful home for the last
year and a half of writing this book. I would like to thank Yale’s Alan
Gerber, whose Center for the Study of American Politics provided me a
fellowship in 2005–6 (which was partially devoted to this project), and
Dan Kahan, who as Associate Dean helped arrange for me to teach at the
Law School in the fall of 2006. The Achiles and Bodman Foundation
provided a very generous—and timely—grant for the 2003–4 academic
year that helped fund my nonsabbatical leave, and the Earhart Foundation
provided summer and research support for the project. I would never
have completed this book without this support.
I also owe a debt to my many sources within the conservative movement.
Pride of place goes to Eugene Meyer of the Federalist Society, who
provided my first real breakthrough in obtaining internal organizational
documents. Gene was under no obligation whatsoever to provide me the
remarkable access that he did—I still recall being pointed to the file cabinet,
in a cramped closet in the Society’s offices, and being told that it was
mine to rummage through. Thanks are also due to Steven Calabresi,
David McIntosh, Lee Liberman Otis, and Gary Lawson, who subjected
themselves to interviews, follow-ups, and reading an early draft of chapter
5. Their willingness to trust someone who was clearly not “on the team”
is to be commended.
In the area of public interest law, my debts are even wider. Clint Bolick,
Chip Mellor, Terry Pell, Michael Greve, Jim Moody, David Kennedy, and
Michael McDonald, among others, shared their time, and, in most cases,
were willing to talk to me multiple times and read draft chapters, in order
to help me get the complicated stories of the organizations straight. I was
repeatedly struck by their candor, even to the point that, more than once,
I penned e-mails reminding them that they were on the record. Special
recognition must be given to Michael Greve, who replied to dozens of
e-mails, and read drafts of the chapters on public interest law and the
x A C K N O W L E D G M E N TS

Federalist Society. In addition, in one especially important case, his encouragement
to look beyond the public record helped me to avoid a particularly
spectacular case of historical oversight.
My chapters on law and economics would have been much poorer
without the help of numerous scholars in the field. Robert Cooter, Christine
Jolls, Robert Ellickson, Steven Shavell, Mitch Polinsky, Roberta Romano,
Jerry Mashaw, Todd Zywicki, Michael Graetz, and others read
chapters 4 and 6, providing terribly useful suggestions as well as, in some
cases, their firsthand recollections. My greatest debt is to Henry Manne,
who dug out, from numerous sources, much of the documentary material
that chapters 4 and 6 are based upon. Henry also interrupted his otherwise
idyllic life in Naples, Florida, for a number of very long interviews,
and was willing to respond to dozens of e-mail requests for information.
Henry truly went above and beyond the call of duty.
At the Olin Foundation, Jim Piereson and Cary Hemphill were much
more cooperative than they had any obligation to be. They provided me
uncensored access—at a time when they were busy putting the foundation
out of business—to the grant officer reports, grant proposals, and the
minutes of the Olin Foundation, a gold mine on the history of the Foundation
and the conservative movement overall. The account of the movement’s
history in these pages would be much the poorer without their
willingness to trust a nosy political scientist.
Much of chapter 2 would have been impossible were it not for the Ford
Foundation’s remarkably open archives, and the help of two wonderful
archivists, Idelle Nissila and Jonathan Green. Special thanks go to
Thomas Hilbink, who generously gave me access to his remarkable interview
with Sanford Jaffe. The story in chapter 2 would not have been the
same without it. I was also blessed with Sandy’s firsthand recollections
during a visit to New Haven.
I am especially indebted to the many scholars who read parts or all of
the manuscript. Mike McCann, Robert Gordon, Jacob Hacker, Jack Balkin,
Peter Skerry, Reva Siegel, Mark Blyth, Adam Sheingate, Stuart Chinn,
Robert Mickey, Chuck Epp, Keith Whittington, Art Ward, Sandy Levinson,
Stephen Skowronek, Shep Melnick, Bart Sparrow, David Fontana,
Dan Ernst, Ilya Somin, Jack Goldstone, David Bernstein, Mark Tushnet,
Brian Glenn, and Ken Kersch all provided incisive comments on the
manuscript at various stages. Martha Derthick and Larry Mead are owed
special notice. Throughout my career they have read everything I sent
them, providing a combination of sharp commentary and credible support.
Oliver Houck of Tulane University Law School saved me when I
had all but given up on ever finding a copy of the Horowitz Report. Special
thanks are due to Paul Pierson, who read a great deal of this book,
but even more valuably reminded me constantly that it had to be finished.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS xi

One final, largely silent, debt must be acknowledged. This book began
as a comparative study of Social Security privatization. Although I eventually
switched cases, my original question remained the same: what explained
conservative strategies for undermining the modern liberal activist
state? Much of my emphasis on organizational entrepreneurship and
long-term strategy came out of a series of interviews with the Heritage
Foundation’s Stuart Butler. I doubt this book would have been possible
were it not for Stuart, who taught me so much.
A deep debt of gratitude is owed to the research assistants who did
work on the book. At Brandeis, Sam Dewey, Dan Kenney, Melissa Bass,
and Sarah Staszak did excellent work for me. I am especially indebted to
Melissa, now a professor at the University of Puget Sound, who helped
get my writing in shape on criminally short notice. At Yale, my research
needs increased considerably, and I was very lucky to have the assistance
of the university’s remarkable students. Grace Leslie did heroic work on
chapter 2, Judy Coleman gets credit for much of the book’s readability,
Jonathan Dach did a magnificent job with the final copyediting, Sophie
Lee scrutinized all the historical chapters and saved me from innumerable
errors, and Sarah Egan introduced me to a great deal of work on social
movements. The excruciating final revisions of the book were supervised
by Judith Miller. It would be impossible to say enough about Judith’s
intelligence, organization, and sharp editorial skills, but it must suffice to
record for posterity that (despite her distaste for sporting metaphors) she
dragged me across the finish line.
Finally, Chuck Myers at Princeton University Press was an exceptional
editor. In an age in which so many presses simply produce books rather
than edit them, Chuck actually read, with great care, the entire manuscript
and provided simple, elegant solutions for problems that otherwise
would have made this a much less readable and coherent book. I would
also like to state my appreciation for the generous and helpful comments
of the three reviewers that PUP solicited for the book.
What is good in this volume is due to the candor of those willing
to share their memories, their files, and their wisdom. The failures are
mine alone.

THE RISE OF THE CONSERVATIVE LEGAL MOVEMENT
This page intentionally left blank
Introduction

REFLECTING ON RICHARD NIXON'S sweeping victory over George
McGovern in the 1972 presidential election, the young White House aide
Patrick Buchanan told the president that, even though liberalism was still
dominant in institutions such as the media, “the Supreme Court is another
story. The president has all but recaptured the institution from the Left;
his four appointments have halted much of its social experimentation;
and the next four years should see this second branch of government become
an ally and defender of the values and principles in which the President
and his constituency believe.”1 Buchanan’s hopes, and those of the
conservative movement, would soon be proven sorely misplaced, as the
Burger Court revealed itself to be the “counter-revolution that wasn’t.”2
Flash forward to 2005. President Bush has nominated one of his closest
advisers, Harriet Miers, to replace Sandra Day O’Connor on the Supreme
Court. The reaction from the conservative legal establishment is immediate,
harsh, and pointed. William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard,
groaned that the nomination left him “disappointed, depressed and demoralized.”3
Todd Zywicki, professor of law at George Mason University
Law School, summed up the mood of many in the conservative legal
movement when he opined in the Legal Times that

inspired by thinkers such as Scalia, Thomas, Robert Bork, and Richard Posner,
and nurtured by groups such as the Federalist Society and the Institute for Justice,
the conservative legal movement in America has grown in confidence and
competence, building a deep farm team of superbly qualified and talented circuit
court judges primed for this moment. The prevailing liberalism of the contemporary
legal culture was on the ropes and primed for a knockout—only to
have the president let it get off the canvas and survive this round.4

Within weeks of Kristol’s and Zywicki’s laments, Miers’s nomination was
withdrawn and replaced with that of Samuel Alito, whose connections to
the conservative legal movement were so strong that they became a central
topic in his confirmation hearings.
The contrast between these two vignettes is telling. The inability of
Nixon’s four appointees to transform the Supreme Court taught conservatives
that electoral success was not enough, in and of itself, to produce
legal change: conservatives’ failure in the Court reflected a deep imbalance
between their forces at the elite level and those of their liberal counterparts.
A generation later, the conservative legal elite—a group that did
not, in any meaningful sense, exist in the early 1970s—led the charge
2 INTRODUCTION

against the president’s nominee and pushed the president to appoint one
of their own. This book will explain how the conservative legal movement,
outsmarted and undermanned in the 1970s, became the sophisticated
and deeply organized network of today.
By the time of Buchanan’s memo, conservatives were well on their way
to capturing the Republican Party and turning it into a powerful, movement-based
vote-getting machine, capable of prevailing in mobilizationheavy
contests like the battle over the Equal Rights Amendment.5 Grassroots
liberalism, by contrast, was shrinking, while its forces at the elite
level—in the professions, universities, the media, and Washington-based
public interest organizations—were surging.6 These new liberal elites, and
the Democratic Party of which they were an increasingly central part,
were of little use at election time. Yet conservatives like Buchanan would
find themselves repeatedly frustrated by the liberals’ success at limiting
the impact of conservative electoral power on the law.
Although conventional wisdom holds that the Republican coalition
was held together by anticommunism and opposition to taxes, just as
important were the specter of “activist judges” and the liberal organizational
network that supported them. Businesses hated the courts for legitimizing
and accelerating the expansion of the federal regulatory state.
Western farmers, ranchers, and extractive industries detested them for
limiting their use of federal lands. Southerners continued to resent their
part in dismantling segregation. Northern ethnic refugees from the Democratic
Party seethed at the “forced busing” mandated by judges like Massachusetts’s
Arthur Garrity. Religious conservatives were enraged by the
Supreme Court’s constitutional sanctioning of abortion and its restrictions
on school prayer. While their particular grievances differed, the conservative
coalition was drawn together by a shared opposition to liberal
judges, professors, and public interest lawyers and by a unified call for
“strict constructionism” and “judicial restraint.”
What conservatives in the early 1970s only dimly recognized was that
reversing liberal accomplishments in the law was more strategically problematic
than other conservative goals, such as reducing taxes and stiffening
the American response to the Soviet Union. While relatively little elite
mobilization was necessary to translate electoral victories into policy outcomes
in these areas, in the law conservatives faced liberal opponents
with a much more impressive set of resources: elite law schools, a large
chunk of the organized bar, a vast network of public interest lawyers, and
the still-powerful liberal understanding of rights. If they were to have any
chance of influencing the development of the law, conservatives would
have to compete directly with liberals at the level of organizational, and
not simply electoral, mobilization.
I N T R O D U C TI O N 3

Spurred by their overlapping grievances, informed by an increasingly
sophisticated knowledge of how to produce legal change, and coordinated
by a strategically shrewd group of patrons, conservatives began
investing in a broad range of activities designed to reverse their elite-level
organizational weaknesses. While similar kinds of organizational development
were happening in other domains where conservatives faced liberal
entrenchment, in no other area was the process of strategic investment
as prolonged, ambitious, complicated, and successful as in the law.7
This book is an effort to explain the legal regime that conservatives faced,
how they responded to it, and what accounts for the timing and relative
success of their response.
My explanation for the character of conservative countermobilization
in the law combines multiple traditions in the social sciences. From historical
institutionalism, I draw a focus on how the choices of social and
political movements are decisively influenced by the nature of the regime
they seek to dislodge. I borrow insights from organizational theory to
explain the internal challenges that insurgents face and how these can
decisively shape their ability to devise optimal competitive responses to
entrenchment. Finally, from the sociology of knowledge and the professions
and the political science study of the policy process, I draw lessons
on how the status quo is protected by constructions of expertise, conventional
wisdom, and prestige.
My choice of these tools does not mean that I ignore the importance
of electoral power or the intrinsic merits of ideas. Against the trend in
political science studies of law, however, I argue in chapter 1 that changes
in the form of political competition over the past half-century, especially
the increasing importance of ideas and professional power, have led to
a decline in the power of elections to cause comprehensive change, especially
in highly entrenched political domains. As a consequence of this
shift, the rhythm of large-scale political transformations in highly insulated
policy and institutional domains, such as the law, is increasingly
determined by nonelectoral mobilization. Change in these domains is
generated by the ability of insurgents to develop strategies appropriate
to specific forms of entrenchment, and to generate organizations capable
of effectively implementing those strategies. The “problem solving”
character of countermobilization, therefore, requires combining a structural
focus on inherited constraints with close attention to the problemsolving
efforts of political agents.
I take seriously the argument that conservatives have found greater success
in the law because their ideas—such as the negative side-effects of
state planning and regulation—were shown over time to be superior to
those of their liberal counterparts. My reconstruction of the history of the
conservative legal movement shows, however, that ideas do not develop
4 INTRODUCTION

in a vacuum. Ideas need networks through which they can be shared and
nurtured, organizations to connect them to problems and to diffuse them
to political actors, and patrons to provide resources for these supporting
conditions. Of even greater significance, the market for ideas is one in
which incumbents have substantial resources with which to frustrate the
challenges of competitors, regardless of how compelling their ideas are.
In short, while there is a “market” for ideas, it is one that is institutionally
sticky and requires entrepreneurial activity to give it life. For this reason,
intellectual history is necessary but not sufficient.
Given my focus on the structural constraints facing countermobilizers,
it is essential to place the mobilization of legal conservatives in the context
of the regime they opposed. Chapter 2 sets the stage for the examination
of conservative mobilization that is to come by tracing out the development
of the liberal legal regime, identifying the sources of its strength and
durability, and thus the strategic challenges that it presented to conservative
countermobilizers. This framing also reveals that legal liberals faced
some of the same challenges that their conservative successors confronted
a generation later.
Chapters 3 through 7 shift the analysis to the primary subject of the
book, the conservative legal movement.8 Chapters 3 and 4 examine the
earliest organizational response to the rise of legal liberalism. The “first
generation” of conservative public interest law firms, driven primarily by
locally rooted, business-supported firms, was largely unsuccessful, and
led the conservative movement to reconsider its approach to legal change.
By contrast, the intellectual school known as “law and economics,” both
at the University of Chicago and in the programs of Henry Manne’s Law
and Economics Center, was remarkably successful. The differing outcomes
of these two efforts at organizational countermobilization demonstrate
that the movement’s success was not simply determined by the
availability of financial resources, the perception of threat, or the opportunities
provided by electoral victories, but was critically shaped by the decision-making
of organizational entrepreneurs.
Chapters 5 through 7 take the story into the 1980s and 1990s. Chapter
5 examines the Federalist Society, showing how a group of network entrepreneurs
built a formidable organization to establish a conservative
presence in the nation’s law schools and created the social capital upon
which the movement’s intellectual and political entrepreneurs would
draw. In chapter 6, I pick up the story begun in chapter 4, focusing on
the Olin Foundation’s efforts to institutionalize law and economics in
America’s elite law schools and Henry Manne’s ambitious project to
create an entire law school around the field. In chapter 7, we return to
the subject of conservative public interest law, with a comparison of the
Center for Individual Rights and the Institute for Justice, the quintessen-
I N T R O D U C TI O N 5

tial “second generation” conservative public interest law firms. I show
how they responded to the organizational design and strategy failures of
the first generation, and how they drew upon the conservative support
structure’s new intellectual and network resources to challenge legal liberalism
in the courts.
The core of this book, chapters 3 through 7, is based almost exclusively
on interviews and internal organizational papers. Unfortunately, very little
of the documentary history of the conservative legal movement has
been archived. Almost every document referred to in this book, therefore,
was given to me directly by the organizations involved. To acquire these
documents, I agreed that, while I would be free to quote from them in
any way I thought appropriate, they would be for my exclusive use. I
offered this arrangement to my sources because I believed that it was the
only way that this material would ever get into the public domain. Because
other scholars will not be able to check my arguments against the
original documents or interviews, I have erred on the side of longer quotations,
and have not strictly limited my presentation of the cases to material
with direct bearing on my theoretical arguments. This should allow other
scholars to draw different conclusions, and provide a foundation for future
scholarship on these subjects.
I have found repeatedly through the writing of this book that the combination
of interviews and contemporaneous documents was essential.
While interviews are quite important, memory, on its own, is fallible, as
most people tend to remember events in such a way that they form a
coherent narrative. Memory, however, is often tidier than history. Contemporaneous
documents, especially grant proposals—a wonderful and
woefully underused source—help to fill in the holes of memory. What is
more, they help to correct for the very real problem of survivor bias in
the study of organizations, the tendency to focus on projects that worked
(and thus were continued) and to ignore the equally interesting ideas that
were tried and failed, or were considered and shelved.
Even these sources do not completely convince me that the story told
in these pages is definitive. The history of the conservative legal movement
is still in its infancy, and, in almost all my cases, I was working more or
less from scratch. As a result, this book is only as good as the papers that
organizations kept and the candor of my informants. Events on which
there was a large documentary base, for example, may loom larger than
those that were equally important, but less thoroughly documented and
preserved. My hope is that this will be the first of many books on the
subject. I look forward to having my errors corrected by those who come
after me.

Political Competition, Legal Change, and the New
American State

Whether a given state changes or fails to change,
the form and timing of the change, and the
governing potential in the change—all of these
turn on a struggle for political power and
institutional position, a struggle defined and
mediated by the organization of the
preestablished state.
—Steven Skowronek, Building a New
American State

A Polity Transformed: The Rise of Nonelectoral Party Mobilization

Political competition, as the epigraph of this chapter asserts, is mediated
by the structure of the state. Challengers to a dominant regime do not
operate in an empty playing field, but are forced to challenge inherited
norms and institutions, or to adapt their insurgency to the structure of
the regime they seek to dislodge. To understand why the conservative
legal movement took the form it did, therefore, we need to begin with an
account of the regime created by its opponents and the form of political
competition that it produced.
In the process of creating a vast new set of policy commitments—from
social insurance and economic regulation to civil rights and environmental
protection—liberal reformers also transformed the American political
system. This new policy process put a premium on knowledge, expertise,
and professional credentials, and developed in tandem with the “legalization”
of society, marked by an increasingly dense maze of laws, regulatory
agencies, courts, and litigants.1 In some cases, the national government
actively encouraged professionalization in order to generate linkages between
levels of government and between the state and society and encourage
policy changes that could not be produced directly.2 As universities
expanded, graduate programs increased to sate the demand for professors,
credentialed teachers, social workers, public administration professionals,
and policy analysts. The higher education sector grew in tandem
with the expansion of this new political system, generally accepting its
POLITICAL AND LEGAL COMPETITION 7

assumptions and supplying cadres of trained individuals sympathetic to
its preservation and expansion.
The fraying of separation of powers, federalism, and limits on governmental
authority produced a policymaking system with multiple, overlapping
programs, paid for and administered by different levels of government
and nongovernmental organizations. Responsibility for policy
outcomes was hard to affix in this complex system, making mass mobilization
difficult and diverting participation into particularistic, piecemeal
forms.3 The diffuse character of government meant that coordination and
control of the policymaking system were produced by networks that cut
across agencies, levels of government, and the state-society divide, rather
than by political parties.4 Even as the Democratic Party’s electoral power
waned in the late 1960s, its strength in these policy networks waxed.
These networks, built largely through subsidy by third-party funders such
as charitable foundations,5 facilitated policy change by encouraging
courts, congressional subcommittees, and bureaucrats to collaborate in a
process of low-visibility, incremental policy expansion.6 These changes
in the structure of the policymaking process made elections decreasingly
important as sources of large-scale policy change.7
The flip side of this institutional transformation was a political system
increasingly sensitive to expert opinion, issue framing, and professional
networks.8 Many of liberalism’s achievements derived from the skillful
use of power by a transformed federal bureaucracy, staffed by actors sympathetic
to (or previously involved in) social movements. This system’s
advent gave liberal Democrats the ability to push their policy agenda even
when the presidency was in the hands of Republicans.9 Shifts in attention,
driven by interest groups, the media, intellectual entrepreneurs, and litigators,
became important drivers of cycles of policy change, independent of
the electoral fortunes of the political parties.10
By the 1970s, political scientists became convinced that these changes
had permanently displaced parties as significant political actors. We now
know that this claim was wrong—or at least incomplete. Rather than
destroying parties, this transformed state produced a new form of party
competition. Social movements and interest groups that had been organized
in opposition to political parties eventually became institutionalized,
cemented to the state, and coordinated in a network increasingly
connected to the Democratic Party.11 This activist network, primarily concerned
with policy rather than electoral outcomes, became the dominant
faction in the Democratic Party. The rise of this faction led to George
McGovern’s nomination in 1972, as the head of a strange new coalition
unlike any the Democrats had ever seen. In short, the new Democratic
Party that emerged by the mid-1970s was “new” not just in the sense
8 CHAPTER 1

that new groups were incorporated, but also in how those groups were
organized, coordinated, and centered.12
The Democrats created this new party system as it incorporated interest
groups and social movements that had once defined themselves in opposition
to the party. A loosely coordinated network that bridged state and
society—what some observers called a “new class”—came into being as
these activists moved into the professions, foundations, educational organizations,
and the media.13 At the same time, older American elites who
had once thought of themselves as part of a cross-party establishment
linked themselves to these new actors, giving them access to institutions
with substantial resources, connections, and prestige.14 While this network
of activists, organizations, and elites cut across the two political
parties through the 1960s, it became firmly incorporated into the Democratic
Party in the early 1970s as the Republicans began to identify themselves
with resistance to liberalism.
In contrast to European political systems, which feature a broad array
of these kinds of activities and movements formally linked to the parties,
the nature of American law (especially the tax code) and the strategic
advantages that could be had from avoiding an open partisan coloration
forced the relationship between the Democrats and their nonelectoral
wing to remain informal. Despite this formal delicacy, an activity is partisan
in a behavioral sense because of what it does, not what it is called.
Political activity can be said to be “partisan” to the degree that participants
operate as a “team” (their behavior is “coordinated”) and integrate
their activities with a corresponding team of ambitious officeholders
(their behavior is “coupled”). Understood this way, “party” is a
continuous, rather than a bimodal, variable: organizations are more partisan
to the degree that their behavior is coordinated with the party’s
office-holding side. It is not necessary that every individual in a particular
institution, such as a profession or a university, actively conceive of his
or her activity as partisan for it to function as a support for a partisan
coalition. What matters is whether there is general sympathy with the
policy goals of a party, and whether the institution in question helps to
coordinate action consistent with those goals and provide services to
support them. Understood this way, the broad liberal network that
worked closely with the Democrats to develop ideas, coordinate strategies,
recruit personnel, and implement policies was now a part of the
party system, in effect if not in name.
For a time, Republicans responded to this newly configured Democratic
Party only in the electoral dimension, avoiding direct competition at the
level of elite organizational mobilization. As a result, they were frustrated
in their effort to create change except where a policy venue had a strong
electoral lever (as in tax and defense policy), or where their objectives
POLITICAL AND LEGAL COMPETITION 9

could be achieved by preventing action from occurring.15 In the new
American political system of the 1970s and 1980s, access to specialized
knowledge, networks across government and society to diffuse information
and strategies, and allies in institutions that trained and recruited
future policymakers were increasingly important, and conservative Republicans
were at a severe disadvantage in all of these areas. This elite
organizational imbalance explains the otherwise puzzling fact that many
of the issues that the Republican Party now defines itself in opposition to
were passed with almost no organized conservative response or critique.16
It was only when Republicans developed a parallel set of elite organizations
that they could avoid being overwhelmed by the Democrats’ advantages
in information, organization, networks, and professional power.
Political parties have always reached beyond the small core of officeseekers
who carry their label in elections, but in the transformed party
system that came into being in the 1970s, these nonelectoral dimensions
of party activity have become increasingly important.17 As the parties became
more polarized on ideological lines, the distinction between partisan
and ideological activity became blurred.18 Increasingly enmeshed with political
parties, these activists and their institutions have become the subject
of fierce ideological competition, testament to which can be found in contemporary
arguments over the composition of universities, the media, and
even the medical profession.19
Parties have gone where the action is in American politics, seeking to
control government not just through electoral warrants from the voters
but also by coordinating the behavior of actors across society and among
the different branches and levels of government. Explaining political
competition in the era of electoral displacement does not require that
we abandon assumptions of rational, optimizing, competitive behavior.
Rather, it demands a recognition of the evolution in the locus of policy
change and the effect that this has had on the collective pursuit of American
political power. Much of the action in American politics currently
resides in the realm of elite organizational mobilization, where the great
battles of modern politics are being fought and where the alignment of
the political system is increasingly determined. Far from disappearing,
parties (rightly understood) are now competing over a much wider terrain
than in the past.

The New Political Competition: The Case of the Law

Complex, technical, and professionalized, the politics of American law
and courts has proven acutely sensitive to the increasing significance of
ideas, information, networks, issue framing, and agenda control in Ameri-
10 CHAPTER 1

can politics. Despite these changes, political scientists have, if anything,
become even more likely to identify shifts in electoral power and public
opinion as the motor of large-scale legal change. Electoral stimuli obviously
influence legal change through the mechanism of judicial appointment.
Purely electoral accounts of legal change are too quick to see continuity
in the legal politics of the period up through the New Deal and that
of the last fifty years. If the argument up to this point is correct, then
explaining conservative countermobilization in the law demands a more
capacious tool-belt than electoral theories can provide.
Theories that look to electoral stimuli as the key to understanding legal
change are hardly new. Fifty years ago, Robert Dahl gave this argument
its classical formulation: “Except for short-lived transitional periods
when the old alliance is disintegrating and the new one is struggling to
take control of political institutions, the Supreme Court is inevitably a
part of the dominant national alliance. As an element in the political leadership
of the dominant alliance, the Court of course supports the major
policies of the alliance.”20 Subsequent authors have followed Dahl’s lead,
claiming that the judiciary is too weak to avoid supporting the “dominant
alliance,”21 actively advances the goals of the dominant party,22 or changes
its behavior only in “constitutional moments” produced by realigning
elections.23 Other authors less interested in general theories of constitutional
change have argued that the Supreme Court, independent of the
composition of its members, appears sensitive to shifts in popular preferences,
although this effect is typically somewhat small, and—significantly
for our purposes—possibly in decline.24
Students of the courts have devoted increasing attention to the conflict
between the courts and the other branches of government that Dahl
thought limited to “short-lived transitional periods.” Because of the long
(and growing) length of justices’ terms, these periods may be more sustained
than scholars in the Dahlian tradition recognized, and therefore of
substantial constitutional significance.25 The nonsimultaneous response
of political institutions to external stimuli sets the stage for conflict between
the judiciary and the other branches of government. As J. Mitchell
Pickerill and Cornell Clayton argue, the Court’s attempts to disrupt the
agenda of the dominant political alliance “will provoke an institutional
response—such as a constitutional amendment, legislation to strip the
Court of jurisdiction, or Court packing—to realign the Court’s jurisprudence
with the priorities of the governing regime.”26 Despite their useful
addition of durable interbranch conflict, these arguments are not fundamentally
different from others in the Dahlian tradition: it simply takes
longer for the legal market to clear (that is, to align with the “dominant
political alliance”) than earlier supporters of the “political court” theory
believed. Entrenchment happens in this theory, but both its source and its
POLITICAL AND LEGAL COMPETITION 11

remedy are electoral. Courts eventually change when, and only when, the
dominant political alliance has sufficient time and power to reshape the
composition of the court.
Dahl’s successors are clearly right to understand legal change as tightly
coupled to larger processes of political competition. However, if the argument
of the previous section is correct, neither partisan entrenchment nor
disentrenchment can be understood predominantly by reference to electoral
stimuli, as partisan conflict ranges well beyond the electorally rooted
institutions that analysts of a “political court” usually assume drive longterm
judicial change. What is more, theorists in this tradition give relatively
short shrift to the declining prevalence or efficacy of institutional
devices to align the courts with the dominant political alliance. Finally,
modern Dahlians ignore the “thickening” of the American political system
produced by the growth of the modern state, which has been shown
in other contexts to have weakened the mechanisms of disruptive, electorally
inspired change.27 In short, “partisan entrenchment” occurs not only
in courts, but also in the social institutions that feed the courts with ideas,
personnel, and cases. In particular, professional associations, the politically
motivated parts of the bar, and law schools are all sites for attempting
to temporally extend a partisan coalition. Jack Balkin and Sanford
Levinson recognize this when they note “one important feature of
intellectual paradigm shifts and constitutional revolutions: the takeover
of those institutions charged with teaching the young by newcomers imbued
with the new learning and inclined to dismiss, often quite rudely,
the purported verities of their predecessors.”28 But Balkin and Levinson
say nothing about how, if at all, “entrenchment” in law schools occurs,
and give us no reason to expect that the process by which law students
(and ultimately law faculties) change should resemble that of the courts,
for which the political mechanism is at least reasonably clear.
The work of Charles Epp provides a useful frame for understanding the
nonelectoral sources of judicial entrenchment. Epp argues that for major
legal changes to occur, a shift in the judiciary’s character is insufficient.

Many discussions of the relationship between the Supreme Court and litigants
assume that the resources necessary to support litigation are easily generated
and that, as a result, litigants of all kinds have always stood ready to bring
forward any kind of case that the Court might indicate a willingness to hear or
decide. But that presumes a pluralism of litigating interests and an evenness of
the litigation playing field that is wholly unjustified. Not every issue is now, nor
has been in the past, the subject of extensive litigation in lower courts, due in
part to limitations in the availability of resources for legal mobilization.29

Hence, in explaining why legal change occurs, we must focus on the supply
side (litigants), rather than simply the demand side (courts) that the
12 CHAPTER 1

Dahlians focus on. Epp’s supply side, which he refers to as the “support
structure” for legal change, includes not just those bringing cases, but
also those who create legal ideas and strategies, such as law professors,
litigants, and their patrons.30 Where the composition of the judiciary is
reshuffled without a corresponding shift in the support structure, legal
change may fail to occur or, at the least, be substantially limited and
poorly coordinated or implemented.
What is it about the law that makes this support structure so important?
First and foremost, courts have substantially less agenda control
than other political institutions. Because of this, social actors who are
mobilized and skilled at organizing litigation campaigns are likely to prevail
over their unmobilized and unskilled counterparts.31 Whether the
Court hears a case at all depends upon the ability of litigants to produce
enough cases to create a conflict between circuits, and whether the cases
produce the outcomes they want depends upon those litigants’ ability to
effectively shape the fact pattern presented to the courts.32 This feature of
strategic litigation substantially advantages those who control the supply
of cases, and disadvantages those who are forced to respond.
Furthermore, for legal ideas to be taken seriously by the courts they
cannot be seen as wholly novel or outside the realm of legitimate professional
opinion. This is work that first must be done outside the courts.
Balkin, for example, has convincingly argued that

the question of what is “off the wall” and what is “on the wall” in law is tied
to a series of social conventions that include which persons in the legal profession
are willing to stand up for a particular legal argument. In law, if not in
other disciplines of human thought, authority, and particularly institutional authority,
counts for a lot. The more powerful and influential the people who are
willing to make a legal argument, the more quickly it moves from the positively
loony to the positively thinkable, and ultimately to something entirely consistent
with “good legal craft.”33

As a consequence, groups with disproportionate control of the institutions
that produce and legitimate legal ideas, groups who have legal “authority,”
will enjoy a significant advantage in persuading judges and other
significant legal actors that their demands are reasonable and appropriate.
If, as Owen Fiss has argued, the “disciplining norms” within a legal community
constrain the range of legitimate interpretation, then the ideological
bias of that community should strongly influence the kinds of arguments
that are successful in the courts.34 Control of the institutions that
embody this interpretive community, in particular law schools and the
organized bar, is only weakly coupled with the cycles of electoral politics.
These institutions not only produce legal ideas, but are also the dominant
force in training successive generations of lawyers, influencing their no-
POLITICAL AND LEGAL COMPETITION 13

tions of the proper function of law in society, of which legal claims are
“off the wall,” and of how a career in law might be pursued. In short, as
gatekeepers to the profession, control of legal education shapes, over time
and not without substantial room for error, patterns of recruitment to the
profession, and ultimately determines who will be soliciting cases and
arguing before the courts.
This support structure is also important because the courts, and the
Supreme Court in particular, typically look for cues from other elite institutions.
For instance, students of the Supreme Court have found that prolife
advocates in the 1970s were significantly disadvantaged because of
the overwhelming support pro-choice activists had from professional organizations,35
while justices were, in the area of civil rights, especially
attentive to the perceived attitudes of national elites.36 Because Supreme
Court judges are, first and foremost, lawyers, they are unusually sensitive
to the dominant opinion in the legal community. In addition, judges can
reasonably be understood as an “enterprise” that includes their clerks,
who are drawn overwhelming from a very small group of elite law
schools: in the Rehnquist years, for example, 77 percent of clerks came
from just seven law schools.37 The ideological team best able to influence
the conventional wisdom among these professional elites is likely, all other
things being equal, to have a substantial advantage in court.
Control of the legal support structure also matters because it has the
potential to shape not only the supply side, represented by cases and legal
norms and ideas, but also the demand side, represented by the composition
of the courts themselves. If both parties were equally possessed of a
cadre of talented, trained, experienced, and ideologically motivated potential
judges and justices and had a network that allowed those promising
individuals to be identified by those in charge of nominations, then
the men and women placed on the courts might simply reflect the balance
of forces at the time of their nomination. But there is no reason to believe
that the nominees in the pool or the network that brings them to the fore
are always in rough ideological balance.38 The side that has the deeper,
more readily identifiable, and better-networked supply of potential justices
will be able to maximize its influence on the courts by reducing the
chance of miscalculating a potential judge’s views and by offering presidents
enough options that they can act on their narrowly political motivations
for judicial selection (which are often quite significant) while also
satisfying their longer-term ideological objectives. Legal networks influence
both the supply and demand sides of law, determining the scope of
electoral opportunity that a political coalition can actually exploit.
While this support structure is critical when groups are on the outside,
it is equally important when they are no longer pressing their noses up
against the legal glass. Once their major victories are won, the support
14 CHAPTER 1

structure can then insulate these accomplishments from unsympathetic
successors. What is insurgent in one generation becomes entrenched in
the next. While achieving a legal revolution may require a heroic development
of organizational resources, once this support structure is developed,
it may be relatively easy to maintain and very difficult to dislodge.
One simple example makes the point. While judicial entrenchment may
seem quite impressive, given that the average term on the bench is approximately
twenty years, that is just over half of the career of the average law
professor. But even this analogy will tend to underestimate the depth of
entrenchment in the law schools, since, unlike the courts, law school faculties
are almost totally self-reproducing. While Supreme Court justices
are chosen by presidents and confirmed by senators who represent contemporary
political majorities, law school faculties are chosen by committees
staffed by a previous generation of professors. It is a commonplace
in the sociology of knowledge that disciplines tend to reproduce themselves,
and ideological and disciplinary projects are tightly interwoven in
legal academia. As a result, we would expect law faculties to reproduce
themselves ideologically, even in the absence of an explicit individual desire
to discriminate, by defining alternative ideological research projects
as marginal or unimportant.39 While there may be some important linkages
between electoral change and shifts in the character of the institutions
that shape legal culture, they are far from direct and probably not
first in importance.
If this is true, then we would expect that for a new political coalition
to fully translate its electoral power into legal change, it must either substantially
weaken the support structure of its older rivals or create a competing
support structure of its own. In the terms of the previous section,
it must become competitive in the sphere of nonelectoral mobilization.
But as that section suggested, control in this sphere is likely to be very
sticky and substantially disconnected from electoral change. In short,
nonelectoral mobilization follows a logic of its own. To understand the
challenges that conservatives faced in developing their own legal support
structure, therefore, we must recognize countermobilization as a peculiarly
organizational problem. It is to the challenges of creating such organizations
that we now turn.

The Challenge of Countermobilization

Scholars in the social movement tradition have been especially active in
trying to understand the organizational challenge of mobilization, explaining
patterns of success and failure by focusing on either “political
opportunity” or “resource mobilization.” The political process tradition
POLITICAL AND LEGAL COMPETITION 15

explains the existence and effectiveness of social movements by reference
to the “political opportunity structure,” which incorporates such factors
as the openness of the political system, the tolerance of protest, and the
existence of elite allies.40 Resource mobilization theorists take the opposite
tack, beginning with social movement’s internal resources, such as
money, labor, networks, coalitions, organizations, and ideas.41 Both of
these theories, like the arguments in political science and law discussed
in the two previous sections, assume that organization is an automatic,
agentless response either to opportunity or to resources.
A useful theory of social movement organization needs to pry open
this black box of organizational development, to explain where effective
organizations come from and how their leaders use them. After accounting
for the effects of opportunities and resources, Marshall Ganz has argued,
significant variation still remains: “Some leaders see political opportunities
where others do not, mobilize resources in ways others do not,
and interpret their causes in ways others do not. To the extent that strategy
influences the emergence, development and outcomes of social movements,
we must ask not only why different leaders devise different strategies,
but why some leaders devise more effective strategy than others.”42
My argument places Ganz’s insight in historical context, situating political
agents in an inherited regime that sets the conditions under which
strategic decisions are made. Within those conditions, however, agents
have the capacity to make better or worse decisions, decisions that subsequently
become part of the context in which future choices are made.43
Political outcomes are, therefore, the product of this interaction between
inheritance and agency. I begin with the challenges of entrenchment, and
then move on to describe the actors who make up the support structure
that seeks to overcome them.

The Challenges of Entrenchment

The challenges of countermobilization are more severe when the governance
structure of a field is well defended. This is especially the case in
professional domains such as the law, where there are clearly defined
barriers to entry. For example, as described earlier, leadership selection
in professional institutions (such as faculty hiring in law schools) is typically
controlled by incumbents. This puts members of a countermovement
at a substantial disadvantage, either because of active discrimination,
through an allocation of positions favoring incumbents’ interests
and skills, or simply because outsiders lack access to the information
that flows through personal and professional networks. A similar phenomenon
is often present in the control of federal agencies. Accounts of
16 CHAPTER 1

agencies as diverse as the Social Security Administration, the Environmental
Protection Agency, and the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission have shown how they were staffed by personnel sympathetic
to, or in some cases drawn from, the social movements that were
pressuring them.44 This tight relationship between agency personnel and
outside interests left those who were unsympathetic to their objectives,
such as conservatives, out in the cold. Barriers to entry can also come in
the form of “rules of the game.” Outsider groups that mobilize against,
and eventually take effective control over, institutions may also change
political processes in a way that durably advantages their resources and
tactics. The form of legal politics that legal liberals developed, for example,
put a political premium on Washington, D.C.—based organizational
presence and connections to legal academia, while disadvantaging the
sort of grassroots mass mobilization that conservatives were in the process
of perfecting.45
Outsiders must respond to normative and cultural, as well as institutional,
entrenchment.46 A regime is most likely to endure when it can make
its ideas seem natural, appropriate, and commonsensical, consigning its
opponents to the extremes. Gramsci described this phenomenon as hegemony:
control through direction and consent, instead of dominance
and coercion.47 Given the increasingly fractured character of advanced
societies, it is more useful to conceptualize modern societies as characterized
by differing spheres, or, in Pierre Bourdieu’s term, fields.
48 Each
field—legal, economic, educational—is governed by its own logic and sensitive
to different, incompletely transferable, forms of social, cultural, financial,
and human capital. Understood in this way, the concept of hegemony
comes close to the role of culture and ideas used by scholars of
the public policy process. So, for example, Peter Bachrach and Morton
Baratz claimed that the most important form of political power was the
ability to mobilize “the dominant values and the political myths, rituals,
and institutions which tend to favor the vested interests of one or more
groups” in order to keep substantive challenges to the existing regime off
the political agenda.49 A regime that has achieved hegemony makes its
principles seem like “good professional practice,” “standard operating
procedure,” “the public interest,” or “conventional wisdom.” Those who
fail to affirm these principles are stigmatized, and their arguments are
dismissed. This ideational entrenchment is likely to be especially powerful
in professional settings like the law, where opportunities for concealing
normative choice in technical garb are widely available.
Operating in a hostile and unfamiliar environment and without clearly
analogous precedents upon which to base decision-making, a movement
faced with institutional and ideational entrenchment will find it difficult
to identify a rational response to its predicament. Put another way, coun-
POLITICAL AND LEGAL COMPETITION 17

termobilizers face a condition of profound uncertainty.
50 Uncertainty may
be compounded by insurgents’ inability to recognize their opponents’ vulnerabilities,51
or by their limited repertoire of possible responses.52 Faced
with such challenges, countermobilizers may fall back on existing tools
and strategies that require less adaptation of the movement’s infrastructure
and strategic repertoire but may be highly unsuited to the challenges
of political entrenchment.

The Components of an Alternative Governing Coalition

To respond to the challenges of elite entrenchment, countermobilizers
must develop what Stephen Skowronek called an “alternative governing
coalition,” a concept roughly equivalent to Epp’s “support structure”
for legal change. An alternative governing coalition is composed of intellectual,
network, and political entrepreneurs, and the patrons that support
them. This section describes the role that each part of this alternative
governing coalition plays in responding to the challenges of
entrenchment, and in the process points to the limits of countermobilization
when this coalition is immature or incomplete. As argued earlier,
changes in the form of governance have made elite higher education,
through its credentialing of expertise and control of the production and
legitimation of ideas, an important source of political power. Because
cultural capital—the habits, skills, and bearing that allow one to be
taken seriously in elite circles53—is transmitted through these institutions,
an effective challenge to the dominant regime must sink roots in
those institutions or produce alternative institutions also capable of producing
not only knowledge but also reputations, prestige, and distinction.54
This points to the importance of intellectual entrepreneurs as a
part of an alternative governing coalition.
The first function of intellectual entrepreneurs is to “denaturalize” the
existing regime, by exposing the hidden normative assumptions embedded
in seemingly neutral professional, scientific, or procedural standards
and practices, forcing those assumptions to be justified and alternatives
to them entertained. The activity of intellectual entrepreneurs signals that
a domain is vulnerable to challenge and provides the legitimacy for others
to follow up their arguments with action. Intellectual entrepreneurs also
provide insurgents with rhetorical formulations, or frames, that give intellectual
substance to otherwise silent grievances.55 These frames, as Erik
Bleich has argued, “help actors identify problems and specify and prioritize
their interests and goals; they point actors toward causal and normative
judgments about effective and appropriate policies in ways that tend
to propel policy down a particular path and to reinforce it on that path;
18 CHAPTER 1

and they can endow actors deemed to have moral authority or expert
status with added power in a policy field.”56 These alternative frames support
“oppositional consciousness,” which “requires ideational resources—ideas
available in the culture that can be built upon to create
legitimacy, a perception of injustice, righteous anger, solidarity, and the
belief in the group’s power.”57
Intellectual entrepreneurs provide countermobilizers with an alternative
vision of social order, drawing upon examples from private orderings,
foreign examples, logical argument, or the polity’s past experiences.58
Given that, in its early stages, the alternative governing coalition is likely
to be composed of widely scattered members, themselves isolated in hostile
institutions and lacking substantial organization, these ideas can generate
“coordination without a coordinator,” providing guidance for action,
confidence that risks are worth taking, and reassurance that others
will be acting as well.59 Finally, intellectual entrepreneurs help to create
durable relationships between groups with disparate interests, forms of
organization, and animating ideas. The idea of the “general strike,” for
example, helped to fuse previously uncoordinated French socialists, republicans,
anarchists, and corporatists in the late nineteenth century into
a coherent political Left.60 The National Review played a similar function
on the American Right in the 1950s and 1960s, where Frank Meyer’s idea
of “fusionism” transformed libertarians, business, social conservatives,
Cold Warriors, and Southern segregationists into the modern conservative
movement.61 Intellectual entrepreneurs help make coalition partners
attentive to areas of overlapping interests and provide the emotional glue
that helps coalitions maintain relationships in times of stress.
Given my argument in the first section that party activity is increasingly
found in diffuse policy domains characterized by networked forms
of organization, intellectual entrepreneurs must be accompanied in an
alternative governing coalition by a second category of actor, network
entrepreneurs. For my purposes, political networks are a form of social
capital, a series of connections between persons that reduce the transaction
costs of political activity. However, as James Coleman has pointed
out, “Because the benefits of actions that bring social capital into being
are largely experienced by persons other than the actor, it is often not in
his interest to bring it into being.”62 Consequently, an alternative governing
coalition needs entrepreneurs willing to invest their time and energy
to facilitate these networks.63 Network entrepreneurs help to build
“strong ties” by circulating stories, complaints, and symbols that knit
people together, identify a common enemy, and encourage intense bonds
to a particular group. They create “weak ties” through the opportunity
for repeated interactions and the provision of a ready source of contacts
across a wide range of social fields.64 The association with the network
POLITICAL AND LEGAL COMPETITION 19

allows individuals to trust one another because membership demonstrates
common opinions or prejudices and allows for the development
of reputations.65 Network entrepreneurs facilitate the diffusion of ideas
by nurturing linkages among intellectuals, political entrepreneurs, and
the rank and file; the rapid transmission of information and lessons
across space;66 and the intense emotional connections and repeated interactions
that facilitate intellectual development.67 These networks are
most likely to be dense and effective when their development is the principal
concern of specialized actors capable of generating trust across the
divides within a political coalition.
Translating the work of intellectual and network entrepreneurs into
concrete change is the task of political entrepreneurs. The most important
functions of political entrepreneurs are to identify and take maximal advantage
of political opportunities in the present and make investments
that will produce additional opportunities down the line.68 The need to
effectively recognize opportunities means that political entrepreneurs
who can effectively serve as a component of an alternative governing coalition
are likely to be “insider-outsiders,” persons who are products of
the regime they seek to dislodge.69 Experience in and credentials from the
existing regime give organizational entrepreneurs the cultural capital to
be taken seriously in fields with deeply embedded expectations of participants’
experience, knowledge, and cultural competence. Finally, political
entrepreneurs need to embed their strategy in organizations capable of
maintaining their focus on the long term, given that regime change is
likely to unfold slowly, requires actions in multiple stages, and depends
on effects that are difficult to trace and thus to claim credit for.70 They
must be effective in persuading actors whose time horizons and ultimate
political objectives are different from their own, while simultaneously
aligning their sources of organizational maintenance with their strategic
goals. This latter factor is likely to be especially important, given the tendency
for organizations to become focused primarily on short-term organizational
maintenance, rather than long-term strategy.71
The extent and quality of organizational infrastructure described above
does not emerge spontaneously: to solve the collective action problem
inherent in supporting these actors, a final component of the alternative
governing coalition is necessary—the patron.
72 All of the functions of patrons
depend upon their role in providing subsidies for organization, especially
during periods of organizational genesis. In this start-up period,
information about organizational outcomes may be limited or nonexistent,
the costs of determining probable organizational quality high, organizational
entrepreneurs’ time scarce, and thus the opportunity costs associated
with fund-raising significant.73 Without patrons willing to invest
large amounts of money in speculative ventures in their early stages, the
20 CHAPTER 1

scope of organizations able to take advantage of political opportunities
will be greatly limited. In order to limit the pressure on entrepreneurs to
water down or obfuscate the content and aims of their programming,
effective patrons need to share with the groups they fund an underlying
strategic vision.74 In order to obtain otherwise inaccessible information
on the quality of agents whose quality may be hard to evaluate from
public sources, they must also be embedded in a common network with
their objects of support.
Patrons also need a significant degree of strategic sophistication, a coherent
overall vision, and the intellectual self-confidence to make investment
decisions whose success is uncertain. Spurring the creation of organizations
capable of exploiting existing opportunities and creating new
ones requires patrons with certain specific characteristics and strategies:

A. Spread betting. Given the uncertainty associated with countermobilization,
effective patrons will spread their bets over a wide range of alternative strategies
and entrepreneurs rather than focusing their resources on a single
approach or individual.
B. Feedback mechanisms. The effectiveness of spread betting depends upon
the existence of patron mechanisms for evaluation, learning, and lessondrawing,
so that resources can be withdrawn from low-return investments
and diverted to those that have shown more promise.
C. Long time horizons. In addition to spreading their bets, the challenge of
countermobilization under conditions of entrenchment demands that patrons
extend the time horizon within which they expect results.75
D. Willingness to accept and the ability to measure diffuse outcomes. Many
of the social and political outcomes in organizational countermobilization
are more diffuse than electoral returns. What is more, even those outcomes
that can be easily measured may be difficult to trace back to the actors that
produced them.

The effectiveness of patrons in pursuing these strategies depends upon a
combination of their skill, the absence of internal organizational conflict,
and the richness of the networks in which they are embedded. Effective
feedback mechanisms, for example, depend on both the ability of patrons
to determine the appropriate metric for evaluation, and the reliability of
the networks that transmit information about a venture’s success.
The most effective patrons are also important coalition actors in their
own right, not just sources of funding. When patrons develop permanent,
professional staff with substantial continuity over time, their position
in the ecology of organizational development can provide an alternative
governing coalition with strategic coordination and institutionalized
“memory.” The information they receive in the feedback process may
give patrons a sense of where the movement is weak, allowing them to
POLITICAL AND LEGAL COMPETITION 21

actively encourage additional programming to fill holes or provide linkages
between existing efforts, thereby accelerating the process by which
opportunities are recognized and exploited. The institutional memory of
patron staff will increase the probability that resources will be funneled
away from projects with a low probability of success, while increasing
the “hit rate” of new investments. These are critical parts of the strategy
of learning-by-doing intrinsic to building an alternative governing coalition
under conditions of uncertainty. Patrons are therefore critical coordinating
structures, the site in an alternative governing coalition where
information is gathered, lessons drawn and disseminated, and slack resources
directed.
Developing an alternative governing coalition with the qualities described
above is an extraordinarily difficult process, and one that is likely
to be characterized by significant mistakes, long periods of learning and
lesson-drawing, and significant lags between the emergence of opportunities
and their effective exploitation. If the theoretical account presented
here is correct, we should expect large-scale political change—especially
legal change—to be determined as much or more by the idiosyncratic
rhythms of organizational development as by the more visible tides of
electoral success and failure. As a result, it should not be surprising to
find that the policy and institutional impact of a rising partisan regime
should vary dramatically, in relation to the depth of entrenchment and
the sophistication of the field’s alternative governing coalition.
2

The Rise of the Liberal Legal Network

TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS of conservative organizational development
examined in chapters 3 through 7, we must begin with what I will
refer to as the liberal legal network (LLN), the collection of individuals
and organizations in the legal profession, law schools, and public interest
law groups that formed what Epp called the “support structure” for the
rights revolution.1 The LLN was at least as important, however, in the
entrenchment and extension of the rights revolution as it was in their
original achievement. The LLN protected and extended liberal accomplishments
in the law, even when the electoral coalition that had originally
supported them began to wither. It was the LLN’s power and its seeming
immunity to direct attack that sparked conservative organizational countermobilization.
To understand the character of this response, therefore,
we need a clear sense of where the LLN came from and why it was such
a potent and resilient force for entrenching legal liberalism.
Conservatives studied the liberal legal network to understand what
they were up against, and to draw lessons for their own activism. As later
chapters will show, they learned that successful legal change requires a
beachhead in the legal academy, ideas capable of generating passionate
commitment, channels for recruiting lawyers into public interest law, and
professional networks to build the movement’s social capital. The professional
entrenchment of legal liberalism meant however, that there were
limits to the lessons conservatives could learn from their liberal counterparts.
Chapter 3, in particular, shows why this process of lesson-drawing
was so hard, and why there was such serious resistance to it.
This story of the growth of the LLN starts with the New Deal, whose
revised constitutional orthodoxy paved the way for an expansion and
centralization of government. The New Deal created both the demand for
and the supply of new kinds of lawyers, and, in the process, changed the
character of the legal profession’s elites and ultimately the legal academy.
The chapter then traces the development of the proto-support structure
of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the American Civil Liberties
Union, and how they were able to produce legal liberalism’s early victories.
One of these decisions, Gideon v. Wainwright, led to the creation of
a network of legal aid organizations under the sponsorship of the Office
of Economic Opportunity. The rise of legal aid, along with the maturation
of an earlier generation of lawyers raised under the New Deal, led to a
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 23

dramatic shift in the character of the organized bar, from being a
staunchly conservative force to one that actively assisted the LLN. In this
same period, law schools began to change as the elite legal professoriate
grew steadily more liberal, eventually incorporating a small but growing
contingent further to the left. These law professors, in conjunction with
an increasingly liberal judiciary, devoted their scholarship to legitimating
an assertive role for courts in advancing egalitarian social goals.
Law schools also changed institutionally. While they had once
staunchly opposed clinical education, law schools began to create clinics
at a rapid pace. This change was propelled by a confluence of factors: a
long-standing concern in the profession that legal education was insufficiently
practice-oriented, pressure from radical students to make education
“relevant” to the pursuit of social justice, an increasingly sympathetic
pool of professors, and funding from the Ford Foundation.
These changes created the necessary preconditions for the final element
of the LLN, a network of public interest law organizations with interests
far beyond those of the ACLU and NAACP LDF. With a ready pool of
ideas from a more liberal professoriate, a generation of law students looking
for a new way to practice law, the experience of legal aid, and a judiciary
willing to remove legal impediments to bringing cases, liberal public
interest law exploded in the early 1970s. Despite these permissive environmental
conditions, the growth of liberal public interest law depended on
a number of highly contingent factors, especially the staff of the Ford
Foundation’s success in convincing their board of the field’s philanthropic
propriety and the defeat of the Nixon administration’s effort to deny their
tax exemptions. Having overcome these obstacles, legal liberals were able
to use their superior legal sophistication, the cultural halo of rights, and
support in the media and Congress to advance the legal agenda far more
effectively than conservatives could further theirs. This success genuinely
shocked conservatives, especially those in business, and led them to explore
developing a legal infrastructure of their own.
Two themes clearly emerge from the story told in this chapter. The first
is the critical role played by the nation’s legal and philanthropic establishment
in the development of the LLN. From the perspective of the early
twenty-first century, it is perplexing why these wealthy, well-positioned,
white men—presidents of the American Bar Association, leaders of the
nation’s largest foundations—put their support behind a project to liberalize
the legal profession. Part of the explanation has to do with the times.
By the 1960s, liberalism had become the philosophy of the middle ground.
Civil rights, criminal procedure reforms, prison reform, women’s rights,
and environmentalism all came to be associated with progress, modernity,
and “good professional practice.” It was, for a brief period of time,
strangely uncontroversial—a bulwark against something much worse,
24 CHAPTER 2

holding out the promise of order and stability in a world that seemed to be
spiraling toward radicalism and polarization. While many of the changes
described in this chapter have become controversial over time, only a few
were at their inception. My story thus tracks that of John Skrentny, who
found that the “minority rights revolution” was made at least as much
by elite white men in positions of power as it was by masses of ordinary
men and women protesting on the streets.2
The second theme of this chapter is that legal liberalism is impossible
to understand without appreciating that its most important practitioners
saw it as legal, as well as liberal. This was not a movement populated, for
the most part, by people who were cynical about the law, who believed
that it was simply “politics by other means.” If anything, legal liberals
had a more exalted vision of the law than their realist forebears. Older
liberals were made uncomfortable by their faith in the federal courts, and
future generations of legal realists, the “crits,” would claim that legal
liberals failed to see that law was always an instrument of power. Legal
liberals, however, quite consciously operated under the “spell of the law.”
The patrons, intellectuals, and political entrepreneurs of this movement
believed deeply in law’s possibilities, and sought to remake the law to
facilitate what they saw as its highest purposes. They were, in that sense,
temperamental conservatives, who believed that deep reforms in the profession
were necessary in order to keep law “relevant” to rapidly changing
times. It was this idea of progress and relevance that underlay a new professional
ethos and provided legal liberalism with its most powerful
source of legitimacy.
To understand the peculiar character of the regime that conservatives
faced in later years, it is critical to appreciate the deep ambiguity built
into legal liberalism. While it was encoded with ideological content, this
content was subterranean, complicated by the need to reconcile a project
of social transformation with the management of institutions that, precisely
because they were professional in character, limited how openly and
directly it could be pursued. This ambiguity was, in part, legal liberalism’s
strength, since it forced conservatives to spend time and resources uncovering
the ideological character of the modern legal profession. The simultaneously
professional and ideological character of legal liberalism forced
conservatives to adapt to this changed understanding of professionalism.
It would take them decades to do so effectively.

The Birth of the Liberal Legal Network

From the late 1930s to the early 1960s, the liberal legal network passed
through its germinal stage. A generation of New Deal lawyers, informed
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 25

by legal realism and experienced in government, created new kinds of law
and new kinds of lawyering, and became in the process an integral part
of America’s legal elite. At the same time, further from the centers of
elite power, the ACLU and NAACP developed a new, politically engaged
approach to the law. With it came new linkages between the law, legal
education, and legal intellectuals. Law schools began their long march to
academic respectability and institutional prosperity in the late 1940s, and,
as they grew, their faculties absorbed a large number of ex—New Dealers,
Jews, and young lawyers more connected to the New Deal than to the
traditional conservatism of the bar. The professional bar, by contrast, was
staunchly conservative through much of this period, but some of its leaders
began to make hesitant steps in the direction of reform in the middle
to late 1950s—steps that would rapidly accelerate in the 1960s.
The New Deal was a watershed moment for the legal profession. FDR’s
administration brought into positions of power lawyers cut from a very
different cloth than the conservative, Republican WASPs who controlled
the legal profession. Their service in government, and the experience and
contacts that it produced, gave these New Deal lawyers a market value
to corporate America that they lacked before the depression, and hence
the ability to create their own firms. Perhaps the most important of these
new firms, Arnold, Fortas and Porter, included New Dealers with experience
in the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, the Departments
of Agriculture and Interior, and the Federal Communications Commission.3
Even as the Republicans recovered some of their lost political power
at the war’s end, the New Dealers’ networks, understanding of the modern
administrative state, and prestige derived from their government service
made them indispensable to corporate clients. Peter Irons found that,
of the New Deal lawyers he surveyed, “two thirds moved into private
practice, most often in large, big-city firms. A substantial number established
their own firms in Washington and New York, guiding clients
through the maze of federal statutes and regulations they helped to draft,
administer, and interpret.”4 Doing well also meant the firm had the wherewithal
to do good, as they understood it. For example, when their former
friends and colleagues in government were targets of the loyalty campaigns
of the 1950s, Arnold, Fortas and Porter put its resources and prestige
behind their defense; at times in the 1950s “loyalty cases were consuming
between 20 and 50 percent of Arnold, Fortas and Porter’s
working hours.” The firm was able to charge only expenses for these cases
because the corporate side of the business was so fantastically lucrative.5
The resources, orientation, and ideology of America’s law schools
changed markedly after World War II. Soon after the war the Association
of American Law Schools (AALS) and ABA began to increase their standards
for accreditation, requiring the appointment of a full-time dean
26 CHAPTER 2

in 1948, a minimum student-faculty ratio and faculty size in 1952, and
gradually restricting admission to students with college degrees.6 Many
law schools went well beyond these minimum requirements by increasing
the number of law school professors and ratcheting down their labors,
thereby increasing the attractiveness of law teaching to those of intellectual
ambitions. The growing quality of state university law schools was
especially notable: by the 1950s, Berkeley, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan,
Virginia, UCLA, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Texas had become national
institutions, with growing resources and faculty.7 At Michigan,
there were twenty-five professorial appointments in the law school between
1946 and 1956, as compared to nine between 1927 and 1946,
combined with “an increase in research and writing.”8 In the fifteen years
after the end of World War II, Berkeley’s law faculty increased 47 percent,
the school moved to a new building five times the size of the old one, and
its “strong California orientation was diluted by faculty members who
were new to the state, brought perspectives from other parts of the country,
attended a wider variety of educational institutions, and had different
preteaching experiences.”9 Increasing in size, resources, and ambition,
these rising law schools were vastly more valuable to social movements
than they would have been just a few years earlier.
Encouraging the liberalization of the legal academy was the decline of
anti-Semitism. Before the war, the elite law schools accepted a small handful
of Jews; in the years after the war, hiring of law professors increased
sharply, quotas capping the number of Jewish law faculty gradually fell
(lowering constraints on hiring), and the number of Jewish law students
exploded (increasing the number of Jews with the credentials to successfully
enter the law-teaching market). Meanwhile, constraints on practice
in the top law firms remained, so law teaching was an attractive opportunity
for many of the best (and overwhelmingly liberal) Jewish lawyers.
At the same time, a sizable portion of the New Deal lawyers who chose
not to join the burgeoning government-relations bar in Washington went
into law teaching. At the start of the New Deal only Yale had decisively
embraced liberalism, supplying Jerome Frank, Thurman Arnold, William
O. Douglas, and Walter Hale Hamilton to FDR’s administration.10 At
Columbia and Harvard, by contrast, leftward movement was limited to
a handful of the faculty, such as Harvard’s Felix Frankfurter and James
Landis and Columbia’s Karl Llewellyn and Adolph Berle. Beyond these
elite institutions, most law schools focused primarily on getting their students
past bar exams, and for the rest “money was generally short, the
faculties miniscule and generally undistinguished, and libraries in most
cases modest.”11 By 1948 Yale Law had hired New Deal veterans Boris
Bittker (Lend-Lease Administration, law clerk to Jerome Frank), Fleming
James (Office of Price Administration), Thomas Emerson (National
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 27

Labor Relations Board, National Recovery Administration, Social Security
Board, OPA), and Eugene Rostow (Lend-Lease Administration and
Department of State).12 If anything, the hiring of veterans of the New Deal
or war service at Harvard Law was even more impressive: nine were hired
in quick succession at the end of the war.13 Of the eighty-two lawyers
surveyed in Irons’s The New Deal Lawyers, a dozen went into law school
teaching, and the impact on Harvard was especially striking: two became
deans of the school (Landis and Erwin Griswold) and another five became
tenured professors (Paul Freund, Stanley Surrey, Louis Jaffe, Henry Hart,
and Milton Katz).14 Two more of Irons’s subjects joined the law faculty
at Columbia (Milton Handler and Telford Taylor).
At the other end of American legal education’s class system, Charles
Hamilton Houston was laying the foundations at Howard University for
a new group-focused and politically engaged vision of law. Houston believed
that the “Negro lawyer must be trained as a social engineer and
group interpreter. Due to the Negro’s social and political condition . . .
the Negro lawyer must be prepared to anticipate, guide and interpret his
group advancement.”15 This conviction drove Houston to transform
Howard Law from a night school that could barely meet the ABA and
AALS’s newly stringent rules to “perhaps the first public interest law
school, with an institutional focus on the effects of the legal system on
the black community.”16 A graduate of Harvard Law, Houston parlayed
his connections, especially with Felix Frankfurter, to convince Michigan,
Yale, and Columbia to support fellowships designed to build up the quality
and prestige of Howard’s professors. The faculty and graduates of
Howard’s law school would play a critical role in the support structure
of the civil rights movement.
Houston was put in charge of the NAACP’s legal program, and
promptly hired his former Howard Law student Thurgood Marshall.
Many observers (including many conservatives) have attributed great
strategic acuity to the NAACP’s focus on education, and its decision to
move from equalization suits (which demanded equality within segregation)
to a direct attack on the constitutionality of segregation. In truth,
while the NAACP’s litigation strategy did have a strategic component, its
decisions were driven as much by organizational maintenance imperatives
(such as the lower cost of directly attacking the constitutionality of segregation,
and the availability of foundation patronage) as they were by the
disciplined, long-term design that contemporary observers have read back
into the past.17 The NAACP LDF under Houston and Marshall was
loosely organized, scattershot, opportunistic, and improvisational, its history
littered with “proposals made by planners who were removed from
implementation of the plans, the abandonment of those plans in favor
of others that reflected the NAACP’s internal organizational constraints,
28 CHAPTER 2

decisions altered because of the preferences of the staff, and negotiations
over plans with constituencies having diverse interests.”18 Its genuinely
critical strategic decision was “to create a central staff concerned with
litigation, not any of the particular decisions the staff made.”19 A permanent
organization, staffed by very talented lawyers who could leverage
and organize the resources of the black community, did not need a clear,
multistep strategy because its continuity over time facilitated learning and
adaptation, which would not have been possible in a more ad hoc form of
organization.20 By creating a durable organization Houston and Marshall
could pass on a legacy to the future development of the liberal legal network:
a series of pathbreaking precedents, a template for public interest
lawyering, infrastructure that could be adapted to future struggles, and a
vision of the role of the lawyer in progressive struggles that was to have
a powerful cultural impact on the profession.
Complementing the emergent NAACP LDF was the ACLU, which had
initiated an aggressive plan of expansion as early as 1929, when it decided
that “the time has come to decentralize our work; to build up local organizations
all over the country.”21 By the mid-1940s, an organization that
had once been led by labor radicals and socialists had become wholly
mainstream: the ACLU’s twenty-fifth anniversary was marked by supportive
messages from President Truman and New York governor
Thomas Dewey.22 Starting in 1951, the ACLU started to ramp up its membership
considerably, growing from 30,000 in 1955 to over 60,000 by
1960 and finally reaching an impressive 275,000 in 1974.23 The ACLU
expanded its staffed affiliates, growing from only four cities with full-time
staffed offices at the beginning of the 1950s to chapters throughout the
country, including the South, by the end of the decade. By 1964, the ACLU
reinforced the ranks of the civil rights movement by adding a very expensive,
but necessary, Southern Regional Office in Atlanta, built on the funds
that surged into its coffers as the civil rights struggle heated up.24
Changes in the mainstream bar in this period were considerably more
limited. Until well into the 1950s, the American Bar Association was a
rigidly conservative organization. The ABA’s president from 1935 to
1936, William Ransom, accused the New Deal of being built from “blue
prints borrowed from old world dictatorship.”25 The American Liberty
League, the most determined and best-funded enemy of the New Deal,
drew substantial support from the ABA’s leaders.26 Through the 1950s,
the ABA continued to warn darkly of creeping socialism, which it connected
to the destruction of older constitutional norms, and projected
itself as a bulwark against government activism. In 1950, the ABA pointed
to the need to “reexamine generally all legislation now in effect which
has a tendency to involve or promote the socialization of business and to
hamper individual initiative and the continued development of the free
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 29

enterprise system.”27 In the following year the ABA president could not
“escape the conviction held by so many of my fellow lawyers that the
‘Supreme Law of the Land’ has been distorted out of its original pattern.”28
In 1955, the ABA published a report drafted by Fred and Phyllis
Schlafly that criticized the Supreme Court for its excessively liberal approach
to domestic Communism. “Anticommunist groups across the
country distributed copies to the grassroots by the hundreds of thousands.”29
The ABA in the 1950s was, by any measure, an organization of
the Right.
This conservative posture alienated many members of the bar, and in
1937, the National Lawyers Guild was founded to provide a forum for
dissenting voices. The Guild brought together a number of prominent
New Deal lawyers, such as Jerome Frank and Karl Llewellyn, who were
connected by “disparate motives and hopes: some were dismayed by the
corporate law identity of the ABA; others were distressed by its active
involvement in conservative politics; some wanted to rally lawyers to the
New Deal; still others (Llewellyn especially) desired an organization committed
to the provision of low-cost legal services. They were united only
by the conviction that the ABA should no longer be permitted to speak
for the legal profession.”30 The Guild would later become the object of
furious ABA attacks in the 1950s, explicitly on the basis of its ties to
Communists, but implicitly “to undercut guild proposals for public funding
of legal services for low-income groups” and to embarrass prominent
liberals who had once been members of the organization.31
The perceived threat of socialism cut two ways, however. It also pushed
the ABA toward a greater concern for the social obligation of lawyers, in
order to defend the profession against the attacks from the left and to
prevent the “socialization” of the legal profession. The ABA was deeply
disturbed by the evidence of government-funded legal aid in the United
Kingdom and by “contemporary developments in the medical profession,”
which together “raised the specter of eventual socialization of the
practice of law—a possibility that American lawyers cannot view with
complacency.”32 The ABA’s fear of socialism was a powerful resource for
more liberal members of the bar who wished to push the organization
into a more supportive role in the provision of private legal aid. In 1951,
ABA president Cody Fowler opined that “legal aid is the shield of our
profession. It protects the integrity and independence of the bar by blunting
the attacks of those who would make us servants of the State. The
establishment of legal aid offices through the land will dissolve the only
tenable argument advanced by those who argue for socialistic measures
to correct present conditions.”33 Despite this rhetorical support, the commitment
of the profession to legal aid in this period, compared to what
was to come in the 1960s, was shallow.34 What was important was that
30 CHAPTER 2

the bar had publicly accepted that adequate legal defense was not simply
a matter for the market, but was a social and professional obligation. This
would have significant consequences in the years to come.
At the same time that the ABA expanded its interest in legal aid, legal
liberalism gained a significant patron in the recently reconstituted Ford
Foundation. In 1953, the foundation gave $120,000 to the National Legal
Aid Association (NLAA), founded just four years earlier by figures close
to the ABA, and $50,000 to support its Committee on Administration of
Criminal Justice.35 These donations would be the first of a steady flow of
funds supporting legal reform, including support to the NLAA for civil
legal aid as well as criminal legal defense.36 The Ford Foundation also
showed considerable interest in law schools in this period, giving grants
to the AALS in 1957 to examine “the problems of lawyer education for
public affairs” and for a “study of resources for legal education.”37 These
were followed by a quarter-million dollars in 1958 to support fellowships
for young law teachers, a million dollars to Notre Dame, Penn, Vanderbilt,
and Wisconsin to “help strengthen the research and teaching programs
of their law schools in law and contemporary affairs,” and large
grants to Northwestern, Wisconsin, and Illinois for research into criminal
law and corrections.38 The Ford Foundation’s support for the bar’s liberalizing
trends was, however, just beginning.
By the early 1960s, American law schools were attracting more liberal
professors and increasing their resources, the bar was becoming more
diverse and supportive of liberal understandings of its social obligations,
and the ambitions and capacities of liberal public interest law were increasing.
Over the next decade, the LLN would expand much further.
Along with the increasingly ambitious Warren Court, a powerful apparatus
for legal and social change was taking shape.

Breakthrough: Gideon, the ABA, and the Rise of Legal Aid

Starting in 1963, the prospects for public legal aid changed dramatically
with the Supreme Court’s decision in Gideon v. Wainwright and the federal
government’s commitment to free legal services as part of the War on
Poverty. In the process, the concept of legal aid changed from representing
individual indigents to encouraging broad-based political and social
change. Remarkably, given its furious opposition to the idea in the 1950s,
the bar ceased seeing legal aid simply as a “shield” to defend itself from
state interference and became a key supporter of this critical part of the
expanding LLN. As the bar signaled its movement away from the conservatism
of the past, it attracted into its fold a generation of more liberal
lawyers who would have previously shunned it.
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 31

Two events in March 1963, one prominent and the other obscure,
dramatically altered the fortunes of legal aid. In that month the Supreme
Court, having appointed Abe Fortas to represent the petitioner, handed
down Gideon v. Wainwright, declaring that “in our adversary system of
criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a
lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for
him.”39 The Court’s decision that access to attorneys in criminal trials
was a fundamental constitutional right had a powerful impact on the
ABA, which immediately set up a committee, headed by Whitney North
Seymour (ABA president from 1960 to 1961), to survey the legal aid
situation in all fifty states.40 Gideon had an impact beyond its immediate
application to criminal defense, elevating the status of access to legal
services—both criminal and civil—on the agendas of policymakers and
the legal profession.
In a more obscure corner of the world, the Mobilization for Youth, a
Ford Foundation—funded program connected to the president’s antidelinquency
program, made a decision to create a legal program that would
provide “1. direct service and referral; 2. legal orientation for MFY staff
members who were not lawyers, clients and community leaders; and 3.
the achievement of social change primarily through legal research and the
persuasion of governmental administrators to change their policies.”41 By
September of that year, MFY decided to jointly operate the new legal
program with Columbia University, and that it should be headed by a
young labor lawyer, Edward Sparer. With funds from the Ford Foundation,
and later with assistance from the OEO Legal Services Program,
Sparer began to implement an ambitious strategy to use the law to transform
the operation of the welfare system, stripping it of what he saw as
illegitimate discretion and intrusion into the private lives of the poor.42
These two events influenced the creation and the character of the government’s
Legal Services Program. The LSP was something of an afterthought
in the planning for the Great Society. It might not have been
included in the president’s proposals at all were it not for the internal
government lobbying of Jean and Edgar Cahn, who had led an abortive
legal services effort in New Haven and whose “The War on Poverty: A
Civilian Perspective,” became the blueprint for the LSP. The LSP produced
a massive expansion in the size and scope of legal aid. “In 1965
the combined budgets of all legal aid societies in the United States totaled
$5,375,890 and their combined staffs comprised some 400 full-time lawyers.
By 1968 OEO Legal Service had an annual budget of $40 million
and had added 2,000 lawyers.”43 The impact of the LSP went far beyond
increasing the legal access of the poor, as it rapidly developed into a remarkably
effective strategic litigant. Between 1966 and 1974, the LSP
submitted 169 cases to the Supreme Court, 73 percent of which were
32 CHAPTER 2

accepted for review (a rate that exceeded that of the Solicitor General).44
The LSP was especially successful in the area of welfare rights, where
(largely under the direction of Edward Sparer) cases like Shapiro v.
Thompson and Goldberg v. Kelly helped transform the administration,
and ultimately the politics, of public aid.45
The ABA, which had red-baited the National Lawyers Guild only a
decade earlier for its support of legal services, suddenly reversed course,
and with each succeeding year the ABA’s support for the LSP intensified.
In 1961, the ABA’s Standing Committee on Legal Aid Work observed
that “we have been forced into placing greater emphasis on defender systems
by recent Supreme Court decisions pointing out that in federal courts
every defendant must have counsel unless such is intelligently waived, and
that in the state courts the right to have counsel provided for the poor is
unquestioned in capital cases.”46 In the wake of Gideon, this support became
even more intense, and spread into civil as well as criminal legal aid.
In 1964, the ABA House of Delegates declared that the legal profession’s
most important task was to ensure that “adequate provision is made everywhere
to insure that competent counsel are provided for indigent defendants
in serious criminal cases,” and insisted that training lawyers for
indigent defense should be a priority for state and local bar associations.
OEO-supported legal services was still in its germinal stages at this point,
however, and, during the early planning of the Legal Services Program,
the ABA was wary and suspicious. Working within OEO, the Cahns recognized
the need to get the ABA on board, believing that “the ABA could
provide just the muscle needed to persuade OEO to affirmatively promote
legal assistance for the poor.”47
By the following year, the LSP was a reality, and the ABA became its
most important supporter. In 1965, ABA president (and future Republican
nominee to the Supreme Court) Lewis Powell stated that his first priority
had been “an acceleration and broadening of efforts to assure the
availability of legal services,” and that applying Gideon had produced
greater demand for such services than expected.48 Tellingly, Powell observed
that

the resulting expansion of legal services should not affect lawyers adversely.
Indeed, to the extent that the poverty program succeeds, the base of potential
clients should expand significantly. . . . It is true that most lawyers would have
preferred local rather than federal solutions. Certainly this would have been my
own choice. But the complexities and demands of modern society, with burdens
beyond the will or capacity of states and localities to meet, have resulted in
federal assistance in almost every area of social and economic life. [There] is no
reason to think that legal services might be excluded from this fundamental
trend of the mid-twentieth century.49
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 33

By 1966, ABA president Edward Kuhn evidenced even greater enthusiasm,
declaring that “render[ing] legal services to the indigent within the
framework of the plan announced by the Legal Services Division of the
Office of Economic Opportunity and in accordance with the high ethical
standards of our honored profession” is “the greatest project ever undertaken
by the legal profession.”50 Kuhn dismissed the “portent of socialization
of the law,” stating that the profession was no nearer socialization
than it had been a year before, and that the ABA’s support for legal services
(evidenced by its support before congressional committees for a generous
LSP appropriation) “should tend to prove that we have not neglected
the interest of the poor or the principle of equal justice.”51 In 1967
Orison Marsden was elected president of the ABA. Marsden had been the
most energetic supporter of legal aid in the mainstream bar since the
1950s, and during his presidency the ABA pushed the administration to
support the LSP more generously, rather than simply taking the government’s
lead.52 By 1970, the ABA’s Special Committee on Availability of
Legal Services admitted that the association’s attitude toward legal aid a
decade earlier had been misplaced and that “the experience of the last
five years has demonstrated beyond the possibility of serious dispute that
maintenance of even a limited Legal Aid program is no longer within the
capacity of the legal profession and those civic and governmental agencies
who provided the financial support before the advent of OEO.”53 Reflecting
an attitude that had become the conventional wisdom of the
ABA’s leadership, the 1970 president, Bernard Segal, called the bar to
“assist in the critical process of curing those afflictions that the gathering
of time, population, technology and social movement have visited upon
American society” by “combining the principle of preservation with the
principle of reform so that American society may move forward again
within the confines of its basic institutions.”54 Support for a liberalized
legal system had been reframed as an instrument of modernization and
as the responsible, establishment alternative to anarchy.
The ABA’s commitment to legal aid in the 1960s and 1970s went well
beyond rhetoric. Having developed a standing committee on Legal Aid
and Indigent Defendants, the ABA went on to add other committees that
reinforced the aims of legal liberalism. A Special Committee on Housing
and Urban Development Law was created in 1969 with support from
foundations (including Ford) and the government, followed the next year
by special committees on the environment and correctional facilities and
services and a new Division on Individual Rights and Responsibilities,
with committees on civil rights and responsibilities, hunger, overpopulation,
alcohol and drugs, and the protection of the rights of women and
the American Indian.55 The ABA also developed an increasingly dense
network of committees to research, plan, and coordinate the project of
34 CHAPTER 2

legal aid in tandem with the government and lawyers on the ground. The
support of the bar gave legal services allies at the highest levels of the legal
profession, as well as, through its chapters, presence on the ground in
every congressional district in the country.
Especially against the backdrop of the 1950s, the ABA’s vigorous support
of government-funded legal services seems, at the very least, peculiar.
What can explain this shift? First, the ABA was moving in this period
from an exclusive to a universal model of membership, and in the process
the class basis of its members changed.56 Second, even though most lawyers
continued to work for and sympathize with business, the balance of
the profession shifted as the generation of lawyers who were socialized
into the profession prior to the depression gradually gave way to those
whose attitudes toward government were shaped by the New Deal and
World War II. Third, as government grew in the postwar period, increasing
numbers of lawyers (and their clients) developed a stance of accommodation
with the state, while others went further, seeing legal liberalism as
a philosophy of modernization and progress.57 Finally, important figures
in the profession concluded that, in the words of ABA president Kuhn,
“if you don’t serve the public as it needs to be served the public will
force some kind of change in the profession.”58 Government-funded legal
services, while not the first choice of many elite lawyers, at least seemed
less intrusive on the profession’s autonomy than the alternatives.
Throughout this process, the Ford Foundation played a critical role. Its
“Gray Areas” project, initiated in 1960 to provide intensely focused services
for poor urban areas, provided the early support for the work of
Jean and Edward Cahn.59 In December 1962, three months before Gideon,
the Ford Foundation approved a five-year, $2.4 million grant to the
National Legal Aid and Defender Association to create model defender
services, establish new defenders offices in major cities, and provide fellowships
and internships “to attract outstanding law graduates” into
legal aid work.60 A year after Gideon, the foundation invested an additional
$2 million to “take full advantage of the tide of interest in defender
services resulting from the Gideon case,”61 and a year later it provided
substantial funding for Sparer’s work at Columbia. Reinforcing the increasing
ambition of the LSP, in 1966 the Ford Foundation appropriated
$1 million “to assist in selecting, coordinating, and financing significant
test cases likely to establish fundamental precedents in remedying injustice
and advancing the rights and opportunities of the poor.”62 Throughout
the 1960s, Ford reinforced the movement for legal aid by providing
grants to law schools to increase their curriculum in poverty law and
related areas, and provided direct assistance to the ABA as it deepened its
support for the movement. At each stage in the growth of legal services,
the Ford Foundation’s support appeared both before that of the govern-
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 35

ment and the organized bar and rapidly thereafter, increasing the speed
and depth of the legal aid movement. While foundation patronage was
not, in and of itself, a sufficient condition for the institutionalization of
the LSP, it, along with the active support of the national bar, does appear
to have been a necessary one.63

The Transformation of American Law Schools

On the evening of August 2, 1966, just months into his leadership of
the Ford Foundation and against the background of riots in numerous
American cities, McGeorge Bundy spoke to the Urban League about his
plans for the nation’s largest foundation. Bundy’s declared, “We believe
that full equality for all American Negroes is now the most urgent domestic
concern of this country.”64 Pointing to the brave leaders of the civil
rights movement, Bundy insisted that “these men and women need to be
multiplied. They need reinforcement. We hope that we can help in that
objective.”65 The example of the civil rights movement had implications
well beyond the rights of black Americans. “Finally, and yet really first of
all in the list of things we take for our concern, I put the idea—and the
practice—of justice. The legal rights of the Negro are a part of it and so
are the legal rights of all who are poor . . . and we see a real chance here
that what has been learned in the struggle for Negro rights can be put to
the service of other Americans as well.”66 With the fires of Los Angeles
and other major cities as a backdrop, Bundy pointed to a future day of
reckoning and warned that “if that day ever comes, history will mark it
as the white man’s fault, and the white man’s companies will have to take
the losses.”67 Civil rights, including the reform of the law, had become a
necessity for the white establishment, represented by the men who made
up the Ford Foundation’s board.68
As Bundy hinted, the reform of the law would be at the core of the
foundation’s work in the coming years, and that project would reach beyond
civil rights. The Ford Foundation had been involved in legal reform
for more than a decade, but with Bundy’s rise to the foundation’s leadership,
its work in the area became much more ambitious and far-reaching.69
For our purposes, the most important examples of this expanded ambition
were the foundation’s work in legal education and its patronage of the
public interest law movement, which will be discussed below (see “The
Explosion of Liberal Public Interest Law”). Without its patronage these
critical pieces of the liberal legal network would have developed slowly
and lacked the strategic coordination that the foundation provided.
36 CHAPTER 2

Changing Curriculum, Changing Students

No demand of 1960s law students was as prominent as making their
education more “relevant” to the cause of social justice, and the clearest
example of what relevance looked like was clinical legal education. These
clinics have been among the most persistently irritating parts of the LLN
for conservatives. In the 1980s, the conservative Washington Legal Foundation
published a report attacking legal clinics, and the drumbeat of
conservative opposition has continued up to the present day.70 Conservative
author Heather McDonald, for example, has attacked clinics for “engaging
in left-wing litigation and political advocacy for 30 years,” claiming
that they “offer the legal professoriate a way to engage in political
activism—almost never of a conservative cast.”71 Most clinics engage in
“left wing litigation and political advocacy” only in a strained sense of
the term, but there is little question that their caseloads over the past
thirty-five years have included little to please modern conservatives, and
provided a significant source of free labor, training, and recruitment for
the public interest law movement. Like most of the liberal legal network,
however, clinics never would have emerged had they simply been, in McDonald’s
words, the “perfect embodiment of a radical new conception of
lawyers and litigation that emerged in the 1960s—the lawyer as socialchange
agent.”72 Legal clinics emerged out of a peculiar confluence of
factors: a long-standing and apolitical movement within the profession
to better prepare law students for the real world of legal practice; pressure
for law schools to do their part to live up to post-Gideon expectations of
legal access for the poor; the demands of an increasingly radicalized law
student body; and the willingness of the Ford Foundation to invest a remarkable
sum of money into overcoming the legal academy’s suspicions
of clinical education. Clinical legal education never displaced the old law
school curriculum, but it did succeed in finding a home for itself in the
nation’s law schools, becoming in the process one of the most controversial
parts of the LLN.
The roots of clinical legal education were far from radical. The earliest
foundation support for clinical legal education began in 1959, when the
Ford Foundation gave a seven-year grant of $800,000 to the National
Legal Aid and Defender Association to support the creation of the Council
on Legal Clinics (CLC), chaired by Orison Marsden, then-head of the
New York City Bar, with a board composed of ABA, AALS, and NLADA
representatives. “The organization’s purpose was to improve legal education
by getting law students involved in practical experience, including
legal services; accordingly, CLC offered grants to finance the introduction
of clinical programs into law school curricula.”73 In a sign of the increasing
legitimacy of clinical legal education, in 1965 the CLC was taken
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 37

over by the AALS and became the Council on Education in Professional
Responsibility. In 1967, COEPR’s leader, Howard Sacks, left to become
the dean of the University of Connecticut Law School, and its board (including
the future Republican attorney general Edward Levi) sought to
accelerate the organization’s work and make it independent. The Ford
Foundation stepped in to lead the project, renamed the Council on Legal
Education for Professional Responsibility, putting up $6 million over the
project’s first five years ($26.25 million in 2004 dollars), followed by an
additional grant of $5 million for its last five years ($17.28 million in
2004 dollars).
Just as important, Ford gave to the project its chief program officer in
the area of law and the administration of justice, William Pincus, who
believed that America’s law schools, and by extension the legal profession,
were fundamentally flawed. An official Ford Foundation report recalls
that he wondered whether “a professional school which prides itself
on the selection of brains and on the excellence of its technical training,
whose diploma is bound to be worth large fees or prestigious jobs in
combination, [should] also concern itself with other matters—such as the
legal and social problems of the poor, the availability of legal services, the
economic structure of the profession and criminal justice?”74 CLEPR had
the ambitious mission of injecting clinical education into every law school
in the country, and making the idea an institutionalized part of legal education.
To do so, CLEPR gave grants to law schools to set up clinical
programs, which had to be partially, and increasingly over time, matched
by the institutions themselves. This funding was critical to overcoming
faculty opposition, as “the programs are expensive, and many older faculty
members are skeptical. It is easy for a dean to sell his faculty on a
program that is funded from the outside, much harder for him to get
approval if the school’s own money is required. Similarly, the needed appointments—whether
of tenure-ladder teachers or of clinicians brought
in outside the usual ladder—were much easier to arrange because they
were backed by New York money.”75 This support was essential in helping
spread the idea of legal clinics: while only a dozen law schools gave credit
for clinical work in 1968, four years later 125 of 147 law schools did.76
The structure, and not just the extent, of clinical legal education was influenced
by CLEPR, since its substantial funding gave it power over law
schools lacking in other substantial external funding sources. The foundation
concluded that “if there had been no CLEPR, or if CLEPR’s requirements
had been less strict, the pattern now visible across the country—
for-credit programs attached to weak seminar components, with placements
in criminal or civil legal aid offices—might be less consistent.”77 By
1972, the foundation had concluded that clinical legal education had been
fully institutionalized. “Partly because CLEPR has been administered so
38 CHAPTER 2

well and has been so careful to demand rising contributions from the law
schools that have been its grantees, clinical legal education of the sort that
CLEPR has supported is almost certainly here to stay, to be carried on
with the schools’ own money.”78
The motivations for this extraordinary injection of foundation funds,
and law schools’ acceptance of them, were complex. The oldest and least
controversial motivation was a sense that legal education had become too
distant from the actual practice of law, leaving lawyers, in Chief Justice
Burger’s words, “to learn their craft in the courtroom.”79 A modest injection
of clinical education was a way for law schools to deal with these
criticisms, without changing the Langdellian core of classroom education.
Clinical education was also seen as part of the bar’s support for legal aid.
At the annual meeting of the ABA in 1960, its Standing Committee on
Legal Aid Work noted that the CLC would “advance the cause of legal
aid by encouraging law schools to expand their existing clinical programs,
including legal aid.”80 Clinical education was seen by the ABA’s leaders
as a way to train the army of lawyers necessary to make their commitment
to greater legal access a reality.81 Clinical education was law schools’ contribution
to the War on Poverty and the Court’s decisions on access to
counsel, as a 1965 report to the Ford Foundation by Professor Ralph
Brown of Yale Law School observed.

We believe that the timing of the program has been especially auspicious. The
higher standards which the United States Supreme Court is exacting for the
defense of the indigent and for the safeguarding of the rights of individuals have
compelled widespread attention to these matters in the bar and in government
just as the Administration’s War on Poverty has begun the mobilization of resources
to meet a wide range of social needs. These developments will call for
the services of more lawyers, and it is plain this call must be answered chiefly
by recent graduates of the law schools. Those graduates who have participated
in the projects sponsored by the program should be among the best qualified
for the new professional roles that are emerging.82

In order to vindicate these national commitments, the character of law
students had to change. This desire to use clinical education for transformative
ends existed as early as 1965, when Brown observed that

the need for direct confrontation [with the legal needs of the poor] is especially
important for many students because their professional work will insulate them
from these community problems and from the human distress with which most
of the projects we have been observing have been concerned. For these lawyers
the law school might provide the only occasion in their careers to deal with such
matters or to observe them at first hand. We, therefore, believe it a reasonable
hypothesis that the lawyer who, as a student, has had the experience that these
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 39

projects provide will be more likely to take an active role in civic or professional
efforts to minister to the community’s social ills.83

The staff report to the Ford Foundation Trustees that accompanied
CLEPR’s initial grant request carried forward this transformational mission,
stating that, in addition to improving students’ skills, clinical education
would “reinforce the social consciousness of certain law students and
professors through confrontation with injustice and misery; and to expose
others, perhaps less socially motivated, in such a way that they take with
them a sensitivity which may be aroused in the course of their later life
and professional career.”84 It would be easy, in retrospect, to interpret
this as a desire to liberalize the law school curriculum, but at the time
encouraging “sensitivity” among young lawyers was seen as a way of
keeping the legal profession relevant to a rapidly changing world, in
which concern for economic and racial inequality looked like anything
but a passing fad.
While the financial support of the Ford Foundation, the moral support
of the bar, and pressure for law schools to do their part to increase access
to legal services contributed to changes in the law school curriculum, these
changes were also driven by intense pressure from law students themselves.
In the decade between the early 1960s and the early 1970s, the
political attitudes of law students and their reasons for attending law
school changed markedly, and at elite schools dramatically. Robert Stevens
found that “the ‘desire to serve the underprivileged’ ”

shows a steady, and, in some cases, dramatic increase over time. At Yale the
percentage of those attributing “great” importance to this motive more than
quintupled between 1960 and 1970. By 1972 almost half the class indicated
that this factor was of “great” importance. Indeed, with the exception of U.S.C.,
the large majority of entering students in 1960 had regarded service to the underprivileged
as being of “no” importance dwindled to a minority by 1970 and
almost disappeared by 1972. . . . With respect to working in a legal aid office,
the percentages rose between 1960 and 1970 from 11 to 28 at Iowa, 15 to 23
percent at Pennsylvania, zero to 18 percent at U.S.C., and seven to 26 percent
at Yale. Most dramatic however, was the increased anticipation of performing
“civil rights or civil liberties” work. During the decade, the percentages rose
from four to 28 percent at Iowa, from 11 to 27 percent at Pennsylvania; from
four to 27 percent at U.S.C; and from 17 to 48 percent at Yale.85

Driving these changed goals was the shifting ideological contour of the
law student body. Stevens found that law students were more liberal
upon entering law school and moved to the left in school as well.86 The
ideological shift was especially rapid at the very top of the law school
world: an October 1967 straw poll at Harvard Law showed that 31
40 CHAPTER 2

percent of the student body identified as Republicans, but a year later
the percentage supporting Richard Nixon stood at just 21 percent, and
by 1972 those planning on voting for Nixon dropped to a mere 11 percent.87
Changing demographics as well as the tenor of the times also
played their part in this shift. Women and ethnic minorities, whose representation
in law schools shot up in this period, reported even greater
aversion to traditional corporate law careers and had ideological preferences
further to the left. By the early 1970s, the ideological makeup of
elite law school students had changed enormously from where it had
been just a few years earlier.
The changed ideological character and professional expectations of law
students was to have a durable effect on law schools. The persistent demand
for “relevance” and the expansion of government led to changes in
the curriculum that complemented clinical education. In the view of the
Ford Foundation, “The clinical movement has been inseparable from the
growth in courses in poverty law (including welfare law, consumer credit
law, landlord-tenant law), family law, criminal law, and prison law. Lawyers
and students have been more concerned with these fields because of
general trends in the society, and because of heavy federal funding for
legal services programs that inevitably encouraged activity in these
areas.”88 These curricular changes would only accelerate over time.89
While these forces could generate more elective courses in the law schools,
it took the increasingly strident demands of the students, combined with
the financial wherewithal of CLEPR, to produce the major institutional
shift toward recognizing clinical education. Laura Holland’s history of
clinical education at Yale found that

at Yale Law School student discontent with the American legal system and the
legal education system manifested itself in symptoms ranging from general malaise
and boredom with the traditional law school curriculum, to building a
counterculture tent village in the law school courtyard, to a mass demonstration
on the New Haven Green. Clinical education was but one battle in a war against
the academic law school as an institution. . . . The struggle to reform the curriculum
centered on the students’ demand that their legal studies bear some relevance
to the pressing legal and social issues of poverty and racial equality.90

In sharp contrast to students’ demands for a role in school governance,
support for clinical education was one demand that the faculty was not
implacably opposed to, so long as the resources were available.
Had the massive growth of clinics occurred ten, or even five years, earlier,
their ideological character might have been different. It was not inevitable
that legal clinics would develop caseloads more comforting to liberals
than conservatives. The fact that clinics were such a persistent demand
of students meant, however, that it was their priorities that were stamped
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 41

on the caseloads.91 Also important in shaping the character of clinics was
the proliferation of legal services, especially those supported by the OEO.
Many of the clinical professors hired by law schools in this period were
veterans of legal services, and brought their legal networks and mission
of serving the poor with them. In addition, public interest law firms had
proliferated by the late 1960s. Clinics and public interest law firms complemented
each other, clinics giving public interest law firms substantial
free, skilled labor, and the public interest law firms helping to identify and
organize cases of interest to students and professors. As a result, much
of the caseload in legal clinics came to reflect the political attitudes and
preferences of the students who demanded them, the character of contemporary
legal services, and the mission of liberal public interest law firms.
This set a template for the future development of clinical education that
became self-reinforcing, to the point that the more liberal character of the
clinical caseload is now seen by many in the academy as part of the definition
of clinical education.92
Student protesters left their footprint in other ways. They demanded,
and with few exceptions received, more aggressive affirmative action in
admissions and faculty recruitment. Flowing out of their previous demands
for clinical education, when this generation of law students graduated and
went into practice, corporate law firms substantially increased their pro
bono programs in order to convince graduates that work in a law firm
was not inconsistent with the pursuit of social justice.93 This allowed the
fledgling public interest law movement to leverage the substantial resources
of private firms, at a time when its budgets were quite modest.
Student protesters did not get, in all but a few cases, meaningful participation
in law school governance. By pushing for affirmative action and
curricular change, students did help to create the conditions for a change
in the demand for professors, a demand that many of these same students,
seeking an alternative to corporate law, helped to fill.

A Changing Legal Professoriate

In this period, the law professoriate continued its earlier leftward drift.
Even more consequential, however, was that the legal liberalism of law
professors changed dramatically in this period. Liberal law professors
became much less committed to their New Deal predecessors’ deference
to the administrative state and the political branches. Inspired by the
jurisprudence of the Warren Court and the example of the civil rights
movement, they also developed a vision of legal scholarship that eschewed
the older realists’ insistence on debunking the moral status of
law, replacing it with a conviction that law could be grounded on something
more than politics.
42 CHAPTER 2

The period of political ferment on college campuses, and in law schools,
coincided with a massive increase in the size of the professoriate. Between
1962 and 1977, the number of full-time professors of law in the United
States increased from 1,628 to 3,875, the great bulk of which growth
occurred in the five years between 1967 and 1972.94 The legal professoriate
swelled because new law schools were created in response to increasingly
strict rules for entering the profession (the number of ABA-accredited
schools went from 111 in 1947 to 163 in 1977) while standards for
accreditation of law schools, including pressure to hire more full-time
faculty, were stiffened.95 As a consequence, hiring among law schools was
especially intense at precisely the time that the law students who would
fill those positions were moving decisively to the left. Law teaching was
especially attractive for the substantial portion of recent JD’s with an
ideological aversion to traditional law practice, as well as for aspiring
social scientists or historians who noticed the dire shape of the job market
in those fields.96 These two trends also helped pull the ideological attitudes
of law professors to the left, and given that academic political attitudes
tend to skew to the left as one climbs the ladder of prestige, these general
trends were felt especially intensely at the elite schools that disproportionately
supplied their graduates to law teaching.97
In a 1972 survey of academic attitudes, the Carnegie Commission on
Higher Education found that law professors, while substantially to the
left of both academic and American public opinion, were still to the right
of social sciences and humanities professors. Law professors reported voting
for Nixon in 1972 at a much higher rate than social scientists (35
percent compared to 20 percent) and fewer law professors reported being
“very liberal” than social scientists.98 By the 1990s the political attitudes
of law professors had converged with their colleagues in arts and sciences,
probably the result of generational replacement, as law students from the
late 1960s and 1970s moved into the academy and their predecessors
retired. John McGinnis found that elite law faculties are now almost exclusively
Democratic: at the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, Yale,
Georgetown, Columbia, and Duke, 89 percent or more of law professors
who made political donations gave exclusively or predominantly to Democrats,
primarily to those on the left side of the party. By contrast, there
was not a single elite law school with a majority of Republican donors.99
Among the elite law faculties that have a disproportionate influence on
the character of scholarship, establish the legal conventional wisdom, and
help determine professional norms, liberalism and the legal professoriate
have become synonymous.
Equally important as changes in law professors’ attitudes were transformations
in their roles and functions. Two stand out. The first is the growth
of the “activist law professor,” connected to social movements and liberal
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 43

litigants and skeptical of bureaucracy. The earliest example of this trend
at the elite level was Yale Law School professor Charles Reich, who in
the mid-1960s produced a stream of major articles that marked a decisive
break with the New Deal legal tradition.100 These provided “the scholarly
foundation” for welfare rights in the courts.101 Where the New Deal tradition
had emphasized bureaucratic discretion, legal informality, and deference
to the elected branches, Reich was gripped by fear of the state New
Dealers sought to empower. In language that anticipated (and influenced)
the arguments of the public interest law movement, he drew attention to
the fact that “Congress and the executive have developed institutional
characteristics which . . . disable them from being satisfactory custodians
of the constitution” and that bureaucracy had proved itself to be “characterized
by its need steadily to increase its own powers; it seems intrinsically
incapable of imposing limits, constitutional or otherwise, on itself.”102
The threat of a growing state, empowered by the New Deal’s
deference to Congress and the executive branch was, for Reich, terribly
real. Reich’s study of “midnight welfare searches,” developed as part of
a project for the Field Foundation, drew on meetings with the nascent
welfare rights network (including Sparer) and argued that the modern
welfare state had become a threat to fundamental constitutional liberties.103
In his famous article “The New Property,” Reich pointed to the
reinvigoration of constitutional formalism as a solution to this threat.
Reich reached back to the pre—New Deal court in his suspicion of delegated
power,104 and called on the courts to resuscitate the “unconstitutional
conditions” doctrine105 and to insist on a much higher standard
of review of administrative decision-making.106 Reich’s work provided a
powerful example of how legal academics could be integrated with the
mission of progressive social change, offering “a vision of progressive
‘law reform’ to be promoted through constitutional and statutory rulings
favorable to the poor.”107 Reich also helped legitimate the idea that, while
a welfare state under Congress and executive branch control was a danger
to liberty, expansions of state power directed by or under the supervision
of the courts were not.
The role of legal scholar-activist became increasingly well institutionalized
in the years after Reich’s work. Of special interest in this regard were
the LSP’s “backup centers,” which helped to coordinate appellate strategy
for cases emerging from the LSP’s ground-level work. The first backup
center, for welfare rights work, was Columbia University’s Center on Social
Welfare Policy and Law (which had received support from the Mobilization
for Youth), and once the LSP was established it replicated the Columbia
program at UC-Berkeley (housing law), Boston University
(consumer law), St. Louis University (juvenile law), Harvard (education
law), UCLA (health law), and USC (geriatric law).108 As new areas of the
44 CHAPTER 2

law, such as women’s rights and the environment, came to the fore, law
schools (drawing on government and foundation funding, as well as their
increasingly flush budgets) developed new centers to provide public goods
for the public interest law movement: training new generations of public
interest lawyers, developing the intellectual foundations for future cases,
and coordinating legal strategy through meetings and conferences.109
Law professors in this era contributed to the liberal legal network by
helping to entrench the work of the Warren Court, culturally and intellectually.
Law professors such as Alexander Bickel and Philip Kurland, who
came of age between the mid-1930s and the mid-1950s, cut their teeth
on legal realism and judicial restraint and consequently found the Warren
Court’s decisions starting with Brown and accelerating with Baker v. Carr
difficult to square with these inherited commitments. The generation of
liberal law professors who succeeded them, by contrast, rejected their
predecessors’ obsession with the “counter-majoritarian difficulty.”110
Whereas their forebears had rationalized Brown as a necessary but limited
aberration, “Members of a new generation who went to law school during
the Warren Court years and entered law teaching at Harvard and
elsewhere during the 1960s—a group that included Jesse Choper, Bruce
Ackerman, Ronald Dworkin, John Hart Ely, Owen Fiss, Frank Michelman,
and Lawrence Tribe—were not haunted by memories of the old
Court and viewed judicial activism even more tolerantly than did their
teachers.”111 Legal liberals’ realist predecessors were skeptical of lofty
conceptions of rights, but this new generation sought to legitimate the
expanded role of the judiciary ushered in by the Warren Court. While the
faculty of Harvard Law were generally skeptical of the Court’s activism,
Fiss recalled that “even in those days it was understood that Harvard did
not speak for the profession as a whole, and even less so for the young,
who looked to the Court as an inspiration, the very reason to enter the
profession.”112 This generation of law professors saw it as their duty to
demonstrate the legal, and not simply political, character of the Warren
Court’s decisions.

In the decades following the Second World War, particularly in the sixties, at
the height of the Warren Court era, a new judicial doctrine arose to replace the
doctrine that was associated with laissez faire capitalism and that was ultimately
repudiated by the glorious revolution of 1937 and the constitutional
victory of the New Deal. It embraced the role of the activist state and saw
equality rather than liberty as the central constitutional value. Scholars turned
to defending this new doctrine and in so doing sought to rehabilitate the idea
of law in the face of the realist legacy. They sought to show that Brown v. Board
of Education was law, not just politics. So were Reynolds v. Sims, New York
Times v. Sullivan, and Gideon v. Wainwright.
113
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 45

Armed with a revived understanding of law, this generation produced a
series of major works that lacked the defensiveness of their elders, arguing
that Brown demonstrated that a muscular role for the judiciary was indispensable
to the cause of equality and justice, while also being above normal
politics. Propelled by a progressive vision of history,114 Dworkin,
Tribe, Fiss, and others pointed forward to the completion of the Warren
Court’s vision as well as backward in legitimating its deeds.115 The nearabsence
of conservative voices in law schools meant that this interpretation
of constitutional law was nearly hegemonic. This was “a dominance
so complete that every casebook, treatise, and handbook used to teach
constitutional law in American law schools is the product of Democrats
writing from Democratic perspectives.”116
These legal scholars sought to ennoble the legal profession, making it
a tool for the pursuit of justice rather than a mere lubricator of commerce.
As Laura Kalman argues, this new conception of the law sunk deep roots
in elite law schools.

Law schools capitalized on the Warren Court. “Glossy admissions brochures
entice some students into law school with promises that lawyers of the future,
riding white chargers, will crusade against social problems,” one student wrote.
As a law student working with prisoners at Leavenworth, another future academic
learned “that the federal courts are special. They are the most splendid
institutions for the maintenance of governmental order and individual liberty
that humankind has ever conceived.” To the children of the Warren Court, “the
law seemed like a romance.” The editors of the Yale Law Journal said Earl
Warren “made us all proud to be lawyers.”117

A heroic conception of the law went hand in hand with a heroic role for
the courts, and not incidentally an elevated status for law professors. This
generation of liberal law professors, which Mark Tushnet caricatured as
accepting the vision of the “lawyer as astrophysicist,”118 meshed interdisciplinarity
with the moral role of conserving and extending the Warren
Court’s accomplishments. An egalitarian understanding of the Constitution,
with civil rights at its core, was for them part and parcel of a new
legal professionalism. Brown, Baker v. Carr, and Roe v. Wade thus provided
the text of a new civil religion, one in which elite law professors
were the keepers of the true church. This role aimed left as well as right,
against conservatives who attacked the Warren Court as lawless and the
leftist legal skeptics in the critical legal studies movement, whom legal
liberals attacked as preaching “nihilism” in their insistence that law was
politics “all the way down.”119
Sanctifying legal liberals’ aspirations for the law was the powerful
moral status of “rights” produced by the civil rights struggle and the
image of a Warren Court that was simultaneously legally orthodox and
46 CHAPTER 2

substantively humane, whose actions rested on genuine authority as well
as decent and civilized instincts. At the same time, the reputation of the
institutions that they sought to reform, such as southern state governments,
urban machines, and big business, was at a low ebb, and the ability
of those institutions to compete in the cultural and ideological marketplace
acutely limited. The place of legal liberals at the pinnacle of an
increasingly well-resourced and influential legal academy gave their framing
of legal politics real legitimating power, helping to preserve the role
of legal liberalism in the legal profession even as its electoral grip was
slipping away. The power of these ideas, which claimed to be above normal
politics, would infuriate, frustrate, and ultimately mobilize conservatives
in the years to come.

The Explosion of Liberal Public Interest Law

By the time that the Democrats’ electoral dominance began to crumble in
1968, many of the pieces of the LLN were already well developed. This
previous organizational development and network-building laid the
groundwork for the final, and in policy terms most powerful, piece of
the LLN: public interest law firms. Public interest law did not emerge
spontaneously; the breadth, sophistication, and internal structure of these
firms can be directly traced to the Ford Foundation’s extraordinary strategic
patronage. The LLN provided a supportive network and ideas, a more
liberal judiciary swept away formal impediments to public interest law,
and the Ford Foundation helped to tie these together by providing a major
subsidy and strategic direction at the organizational generation stage.120
The impact of public interest law was explosive, and it set the stage for
the early countermobilization by conservatives.
The Ford Foundation’s support for public interest law was anything
but inevitable. The foundation was far from a monolith, divided
between a staff closely tied to the liberal legal network and an establishment
board intensely concerned with propriety and responsibility. The
foundation’s staff focused on persuading the board that public interest
law was a sensible enterprise for the foundation. They argued that the
foundation was already supporting the NAACP LDF and programming
in indigent defense and legal education, and was generally pushing the
bar to be more progressive and oriented to social reform. In addition,
McGeorge Bundy had established civil rights and poverty as the foundation’s
overarching goals, and this provided an obvious justification for
replicating the civil rights movement’s legal approach with other groups
(hence the foundation’s support for the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, and the
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 47

Native American Rights Fund). Finally, the foundation had active programming
in areas such as communications and the environment, and
this justified moving the focus of public interest law beyond ethnic and
racial minorities to these new areas as well.
“Public interest” law, as distinct from civil rights or poverty law, presented
some unique and very tricky issues for the foundation’s leadership.
The constituencies targeted by public interest law were not, on the whole,
poor or disadvantaged, and thus not obvious targets of philanthropic support.
It was here that increasingly popular critiques of interest group pluralism
helped the foundation’s leaders justify their support of what might
otherwise look like direct political activity.121 Bundy recalled that this new
thinking first took hold in energy policy, but soon grew much broader.

That grew out of a growing feeling [that] the public interest in analyzing it was
not adequately represented . . . whereas the various or special interests were
busy as can be, primarily but not exclusively, the commercial interests. . . . It’s
the old shoe-pinching argument of the democratic theorists that those whose
interests are most closely affected are those who will pay the most attention . . .
those . . . most attentive to their interests get there faster with more arguments
than those who may in the end be just as much affected either as consumers or
as workers or as students. . . . We encountered that problem when we moved
into the policy aspects of public broadcasting; we encountered it again here in
the energy case and its exists also in defense studies; in arms control studies; and
I myself believe, it exists in the public interest law field. I think the Foundation is
right to be ready to take a lively interest in those kinds of problems where
there are plenty of people and forces and money to represent existing organized
interests and not so much... that is unaffected by either personal or commercial
or corporate or institutional interests. Broadly speaking, the Foundation
doesn’t have that kind of interest.122

This argument helped Bundy and the board reconcile the nonpartisan
traditions of foundation philanthropy with the creation of a network of
public interest law firms connected to liberal social movements. Instead
of actively supporting one side in a political dispute, the Ford Foundation’s
role was simply a means of ensuring “balance” and an opportunity
for arguments to be heard on both sides. It was well understood at the
time, however, that public interest law would be in considerable tension
with the Nixon administration. The program’s original planning document
noted that “whatever its other virtues may be, the prevailing attitude
and view of the present Administration with respect to the meaning of
the Constitution and the purpose of the nation has effectively shut off
service in the Executive Branch of the national government as a viable
outlet for large numbers of young people trained in the law who have
public service motivations.”123 This illustrates one of the peculiar qualities
48 CHAPTER 2

of much of the LLN and the prevailing liberal consensus in elite circles
and institutions. While in substance it often operated to support ideological
and partisan causes, it was understood by many of its patrons and key
participants in objective, neutral, nonpartisan, and nonideological terms.
This framing of the legal liberal cause facilitated support from elite institutions
and protected its tax status, and in later years it forced conservatives
to devote resources to “exposing” the LLN’s veiled ideological character.
The staff of the Ford Foundation had a second challenge in selling public
interest law to their board: defusing potential concerns that the project
was too politically hot for the foundation to handle. While the board was
increasingly sympathetic to liberal causes, its members were by no means
radical and in their professional life directed the most established institutions
in American life. As a consequence, much of the structure of the
public interest law firms supported by the Ford Foundation was put in
place simply to neutralize possible opposition from its board. Sanford
Jaffe, the Ford Foundation program officer in charge of the Government
and Law Program from 1968 to 1983, recalls that the program’s greatest
challenge was the question of

how do we [insulate] ourselves from . . . criticism both from some people on
the Ford board and a lot of people from the outside? And that’s really where
we come across . . . an extraordinarily great idea. . . . I would go to a group
called the Public Interest Law Advisory Committee and I would get their judgment
as to whether or not this grant was a good grant . . . whether the people
on the boards were really competent and they would be responsible people. So
that way we would be able to tell the Ford board that, “Look, we have got
these four very eminent people who have helped Sandy to make these grants.”
And then when we got attacked from the outside—which we did . . . I would
be able to say, “Look, I got the advice of these four people.” And who did we
pick? We picked four ex-presidents of the American Bar Association. . . . [For
example,] William Gossett . . . represented Henry Ford. . . . We had a sense that
Henry Ford would be one of the difficult guys on the Ford board. The automobile
industry might be a target of these law firms, who knew? . . . That became
a key element to be able to say to Henry Ford if he had a problem, “Well, Bill
Gossett—your lawyer—thinks that this is a worthwhile enterprise, he’s joining
us in looking at it.”. . . I think without the structure I don’t think we would
have had a public interest law program. The Ford board, in my judgment,
would have been very, very reluctant to approve the program.124

Jaffe also directly influenced the internal structure of the public interest
law firms in order to assuage the foundation’s board. The firms would
have a litigation committee that would have to approve each case, and
the committee would be made up of the same sorts of white-shoe lawyers
as the Ford Foundation advisory committee.
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 49

And the theory behind that was, if somebody said, “Hey, these bunch of kids
just out of Yale, or out of Harvard, or Columbia were suing, you know, the big
auto companies or were suing the big chemical companies. Why’d these crazy
Ford people give these kids a lot of money to do that? What do they know
about this?” We’d say, “Now, wait a minute, they have a distinguished board
and beside that they have a litigation committee and they cannot file a lawsuit
unless the litigation committee’s approved it.” Now look who’s on the litigation
committee. Arthur Goldberg, you know was a former Supreme Court Justice,
this person and that person and these are all senior partners at law firms.125

The foundation’s program officers did all they could to give this potentially
explosive program a smooth, establishment veneer. Beyond the elite
lawyers on the boards of foundation and the public interest law firms, the
program officers were able to point to previous victories against attacks
on legal services (in the form of the “Murphy amendment,” which would
have given state governors a veto over legal services programs) as evidence
that the establishment would, in fact, come to public interest law’s aid
when attacked:

A well organized lobbying effort to knock the Murphy amendment out of the
OEO bill was mounted in the House. This unanticipated effort was powered
by the fully mobilized, nationwide engines of the American Bar Association,
supported by the staffs of the nation’s law schools, and skillfully orchestrated
by OEO Director Donald Rumsfeld and his deputies for Legal Services. . . . The
ABA has been given total credit by the bill’s managers for persuading a dozen
or more congressmen of impeccable conservative hue and traditional antipathy
to “poverty give-aways” to stand up for the Legal Services program before the
outcome was clear.126

The transformation of the legal establishment gave public interest law a
critical ally, assuring the Ford Foundation board that it would not be
alone when the inevitable backlash came. Without this reassurance, the
program would never have gotten past the foundation’s board.
The second and closest-run episode in the development of public interest
law concerned the firms’ tax status. When the Ford Foundation was
in the early planning process for its public interest law initiative, it was
unclear whether these firms would be eligible under Section 501(c)(3) of
the federal tax code, which grants tax deductibility to nonprofit, charitable
organizations. Jaffe recalls that

Bundy said, “What if somebody hassles us about the charitable nature of this?”
And you gotta remember, this was in a period of time in which . . . the only
civil rights legal organization that existed, in my recollection, was the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund. I mean, the Native American Rights Fund hadn’t been
created yet, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund hadn’t been created yet, wom-
50 CHAPTER 2

en’s rights law hadn’t been accepted, there were no environmental public interest
law firms at this point, so the notion of a group of lawyers having a pot of
money and then using that pot of money to litigate on behalf of the public
interest, some people thought might be a violation of the charitable tax code
that sets up charitable giving and all that business.127

The early foundation planning documents took this consideration very
seriously, and Jaffe reports that Bundy specifically directed him that “even
before we go to the Board . . we need an opinion from a very elegant,
first-class lawyer that says we can do this as a charitable thing.”128 Even
getting the opinion was difficult: the first lawyer the foundation approached
declined, citing potential conflicts with the firm’s clients.129 The
early planning documents for public interest law make clear how uncertain
the tax deductibility issue was. On the one hand, a report noted,
“At least at present, the term ‘legislation’ does not embrace the quasilegislative
actions of regulatory and other administrative agencies,”130 and
thus the actions of public interest law firms did not directly and explicitly
fall under the requirement that 501(c)(3) organizations not “attempt to
influence legislation.” The tax code also permitted “public advocacy” by
tax exempt organizations, so long as it did not cross “partisan” or “legislative”
lines. On the other hand, the same report noted that “Treasury
regulations do not explicitly authorize litigation in the courts by tax-exempt
organizations, and thus contain no overt authorization for litigation
as the prime rationale for a tax-exempt organization.”131 The foundation
thought that the exemptions provided to the Center for Law and Social
Policy, the Center for the Study of Responsive Law, and the NAACP suggested
that the IRS was on its side, concluding that “while clearly volatile
and unpredictable, the climate in Washington with respect to this particular
activity appears, at present, to be improving.”132
The climate was not, in fact, “improving.” In March 1970, the IRS
gave the Natural Resources Defense Council tax deductible status, but
only on the condition that “the NRDC . . gain prior clearance on each
lawsuit it planned. The IRS would then be able to rule in each separate
case whether the NRDC was doing anything to jeopardize its tax deductibility.”133
Jaffe recalls that “it became a real hullabaloo and it would have
stopped our program right in the middle,” as these restrictions would
have required that the firms surrender their 501(c)(3) status, damaging
their ability to raise funds from foundations and individuals.134
While the Nixon administration had a strong interest in preventing the
growth of tax-deductible public interest law firms, and communicated
this clearly to the IRS, this early effort at “defunding the Left” was no
match for the increasingly well-coordinated LLN. Two of the most important
environmental officials in the Nixon administration, William
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 51

Ruckleshaus (then-nominee to head the EPA) and Russell Train, of the
Council for Environmental Quality, came out against the IRS’s ruling.135
They were not alone in rising to public interest law’s defense. Jaffe recalls,

One of the things that was very helpful were our four advisors who, having
been: a) ex-Presidents of the American Bar Association; b) all from extraordinarily
well-positioned, prestigious law firms and all men of integrity and substance
and so-forth began to make the calls that they felt it was necessary to
make and to talk to people, point out the rightness of the law and the wrongness
of their interpretation. . . I think it showed that there were forces aligned out
there who felt that this was not something they wanted to see. I think it also
showed that there was a lot of support from the bar.136

Such “men of integrity” did not exist just a few years earlier. Now, core
members of the legal establishment had deep connections to the liberal
legal network and were willing to put the force of the ABA and their own
reputations behind public interest law. Just as was the case with defeating
the Murphy amendment, this support made all the difference in swaying
an elected Republican administration.
It is highly unlikely that public interest law would have gotten off the
ground were it not for the support of the Ford Foundation. While some
of these firms now have large budgets and thousands of members, in the
late 1960s and early 1970s groups representing large, diffuse interests
were still quite novel and the mechanisms of generating support unclear.
Patron support allowed these groups to get past the difficult early stages
of organizational formation, while allowing them to become active players
in the policy process before building a mass membership base.137
Would other patrons have emerged to support public interest law? It
seems highly unlikely. Jaffe recalls that the large financial and reputational
investment of the project led Bundy to seek partners in other large foundations,
such as Rockefeller, Mellon, and Carnegie, but the controversial
nature of the project led them to reject his entreaties.138 This strongly
suggests that, had the program officers not been able to effectively manage
the difficult diplomatic work within the Ford Foundation, public interest
law would have lacked a single major supporter. The foundation went
beyond funding to provide coordination and advice. It sought to create a
broad swathe of firms, distributed across the country and covering a range
of policy areas, and identified organizational entrepreneurs willing to fill
the holes in the public interest law network. It put budding public interest
lawyers in touch with the legal establishment, recommended lawyers for
their boards, and shaped their internal structure (going so far as to reject
NRDC’s original desire to have a communal leadership structure). The
existence of a dense network of liberal public interest law firms was, in
short, a highly contingent outcome. While changes in the opportunity
52 CHAPTER 2

structure, as discussed in the next section, were necessary to the success
of the enterprise, without the patronage of the Ford Foundation those
opportunities would have lacked organizations capable of effectively
exploiting them.

The Liberal Legal Network and the New Politics

Before the public interest law project got off the ground, the Ford Foundation
staff could identify signs of support for public interest law in the
courts, Congress, and administrative agencies, but for the project to have
its full impact this support would have to increase substantially. Law “in
the public interest” required changes in traditional legal concepts, such
as standing, the definition of a class, and the allocation of legal fees, without
which the firms would be stopped at the courthouse door. This was
a matter of the greatest concern for the foundation’s leadership because,
as Jaffe recalls, if “the only guy who’s got standing is the guy whose house
is going to be impacted, then you can’t do this kind of stuff . . . it would
have been conceivable, had standing gone the other way, that it would
have killed the movement then—or at least circumscribed it so much that
it would have been very hard to bring a lot those kinds of class action
cases.”139 Congress and the courts did, in fact, respond, making possible
the impressive legal achievements of the era. The Center for Law in the
Public Interest, Public Advocates, Natural Resources Defense Council,
Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Citizens
Communications Center, Georgetown Institute for Public Interest Representation,
League of Women Voters Education Fund, Education Law Center,
International Project, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund, Native American Rights Fund, and the ACLU Women’s
Rights Project all started with Ford Foundation funding.
Shifts in the American political system in the late 1960s and into the
1970s made it much more accessible to the public interest law movement,
helping solve problems of financing and providing protection
when it was attacked. The public interest law movement was both beneficiary
and contributor to what political scientists soon identified as “the
New American political system” or the “new politics of public policy.”140
This new form of politics was tailor-made for the strengths of public
interest advocates, while simultaneously disadvantaging those of their
adversaries. What Daniel Patrick Moynihan had, in the early 1960s,
called the “professionalization of reform” had become, by the end of
that decade and in the decade following, the “legalization of reform.”141
The professionalization of reform that Moynihan noted in 1965 reflected
a peculiar feature of the politics of politics in the 1960s and 1970s, which
was the diminishing role of popular mobilization in setting the govern-
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 53

ment’s agenda and the increasing role of ideas generated in the academy,
professions, and government itself. Those who controlled the production
of ideas and intellectuals, therefore, had a substantial competitive advantage.Connected
to this was the transformation of the American elite media.
In the 1960s and 1970s a new generation of reporters appeared in America’s
newsrooms, and with them a changed conception of journalism. Journalists
became eager to set their own agenda, and became open to those
outside government who wished to use the news to introduce new issues
into public debate or to challenge existing government policy. Stories of
Americans demanding their rights, and challenging the discretion of government
officials, fit nicely into this changed conception of the role of
journalism, and actors within the LLN were well placed to take advantage
of this openness. These new journalists shared the public interest lawyers’
suspicions of corporations, regulatory agencies, and local government,
making the media a substantial resource in using litigation to shape public
perceptions and the government’s agenda.
Congress, which was undergoing sweeping reform in this period, expanded
public interest groups’ access to government. A twenty-year
movement to “open up” Congress came to fruition in the early 1970s, as
the power of conservative committee barons was broken and a new Congress
emerged in its stead, dominated by its subcommittees.142 The subcommittees
whose work was most important to the public interest law
movement were typically led by those members with the most sympathy
for the LLN, who used their position in Congress to protect and nurture
it. These subcommittees were often staffed by young liberal lawyers with
strong linkages (through the Nader and civil rights networks, for example)
to allies across the government. Starting in the late 1960s, when liberals
could no longer count on a sympathetic administration, Congress
began to pass a number of low-profile legal provisions allowing for “citizen
suits,” loosening rules of standing, and facilitating public comment
in regulatory proceedings, leading to more stringent agency regulation.143
Few of these changes attracted much attention at the time, but the public
interest law movement and its allies in Congress understood their importance,
since they indirectly subsidized the practice of public interest law
in regulatory and court settings and encouraged regulators to err toward
stringency.144 These shifts were possible because the decentralization of
Congress had diminished the importance of “the floor” in Congress,
transferring it to legislative “high demanders” in subcommittees. While
regulated industries were high demanders on the specific implementation
of regulations, they were unmotivated on broader issues since the impact
of these procedural decisions on the corporate bottom line was distant
and often difficult to trace.145
54 CHAPTER 2

These changes in courts, bureaucracies, and Congress were all tied to
the increasing centralization of policymaking in Washington.146 Federal
bureaucracies and courts came to supervise large swaths of policy, even
in areas that remained under the nominal control of state or local governments.
This centralization of policymaking diminished the value of
broad-based, federated organizations and mass movements, but advantaged
groups that were organized in Washington and networked into
its web of agencies, courts, media, congressional subcommittees, and
research organizations.147 The centralization of government matched the
centralization of the public interest law movement, whose lawyers “located
themselves in Washington, D.C.—and, more specifically, in the
once low-rent areas around Dupont Circle—[which] facilitated the opportunity
for frequent interaction.”148 The Washington-based structure
of the movement allowed for strategies and information to be quickly
disseminated, networks to form, and ideas to be shared across the
boundaries of Washington’s formally separated powers. Information,
networks, and proximity were central to this new centralized politics,
and were, in the new politics of the 1970s, just as important as masses
of active members or economic power.
The consequences of the emergence of the LLN for the outcomes of
public policy were substantial and far-reaching. Lawyers associated with
the welfare rights movement (most of whom worked for the LSP) convinced
federal courts to oversee a revolution in welfare policy, which
caused the percentage of eligible persons actually receiving welfare to
more than double in a matter of a few years.149 Lawyers for the NAACP
LDF and the ACLU succeeded, for a time, in abolishing the death penalty.150
Building on an initially judge-sponsored movement to reform prisons,
the NAACP LDF, ACLU, and a growing network of law clinics and
pro bono lawyers remade the American prison system.151 Starting with
Griswold v. Connecticut and concluding with Roe v. Wade, advocates
were able to push abortion law from a trajectory of moderate, limited
liberalization rapidly running out of steam to legalized abortion as the
law of the land.152 The ACLU Women’s Rights Project achieved through
the courts what it could not obtain through the constitutional amendment
process: constitutional equality for women.153 In a broad range of regulatory
issues, from the environment to land use and the treatment of the
disabled, public interest lawyers were able to maximize the impact of
congressional enactments, despite the substantial costs these imposed on
business and local governments.154 Lawyers who spoke for a wide range
of minority groups, especially Hispanics, were able to use a combination
of regulation and litigation to incorporate themselves into the civil rights
regime originally established for black Americans, despite an absence of
mass mobilization.155 American public schooling, especially in the areas
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 55

of discipline and student free speech, was transformed from a regime of
almost total administrator discretion to one of pervasive legalization.156
In perhaps the most emotional case of court-led policy change, judges
mandated busing for racial balance in urban public schools, a policy that
led to broad popular disapproval, and, in some cases, violence.157 While
a few of these policy changes were eaten away at the edges, what is remarkable
is their original accomplishment and subsequent resilience.
Litigators were far from alone in these cases, drawing on a network of
supporters in the legal academy, the bar, and the other professions. This
network helped them fund, identify, and develop cases, establish their
intellectual rationale, and provide the legitimacy that courts often assume
from broad elite support. The power of this network came in large part
because of the weakness of its opposition. In case after case identified
before, defenders of the status quo were marked by their intellectual
superficiality, their almost total lack of agenda control, an absence of information,
and a vacuum in support from professional elites. Whereas
liberals had specialized repeat-players defending their side in court, conservatives
were often represented by relatively unsophisticated state government
lawyers,158 or representatives of business who were more interested
in minimizing their costs than in long-term legal strategy.159
Finally, the combination of court action and the LLN served to insulate
these reforms from reversal, even when they were unpopular or imposed
large costs on concentrated, wealthy, organized groups. The LLN was
well equipped for rapid mobilization when conservatives attempted to
use their power in the elected branches of government to reverse liberal
victories in the courts or the bureaucracy. The legal and intellectual resources
available to conservatives at the time, by contrast, paled in comparison.
The LLN’s victories in court were also protected by the constitution’s
separation of powers. As Shep Melnick astutely explained, “By
establishing a new policy status quo, the court shifted what might be
called the political burden of proof within Congress. No longer was the
burden on those favoring national uniformity and program expansion to
build a coalition broad enough to pass new legislation. Now the burden
was on their opponents to pass legislation to overturn the courts. Given
the obstacles to constructing winning coalitions in Congress, this shift
often proved decisive.”160 So long as liberals had disproportionate power
over the agenda of courts and the institutions that supported them, conservative
power elsewhere was a very limited countervailing force. As a
result, liberals could achieve durable policy outcomes far from the center
of public opinion (as in the case of busing and affirmative action) or that
squeezed implementation of popular policies past where they would have
gone otherwise (as was the case with disability and the environment).161
56 CHAPTER 2

Conclusion

The development of the LLN into a formidable support structure for legal
and policy change was not foreordained. Up through the 1950s liberals
were largely outsiders in the professional bar. While the character of legal
academia was changing in the 1950s, its liberalism was suspicious of
courts, and few law schools had the resources to contribute to progressive
social change. Legal aid was scarce, and public interest law did not reach
beyond the ACLU and NAACP LDF. The Ford Foundation was becoming
more interested in funding legal reform, but its interest was still in its
nascent stages.
The development of the liberal legal network from these meager roots
depended on a confluence of factors. First, the fear of state involvement
in the legal profession, the incorporation of a new generation of more
liberal lawyers, and the seismic impact of Gideon v. Wainwright caused
the legal profession to alter its relationship to legal liberalism. Second,
the social disruptions of the 1960s caused many American elites to see
legal liberalism as the civilized response to challenges that would otherwise
spill into the streets. Third, the courts and the federal government
became substantially more sympathetic to legal liberalism, providing
elite sanction for its goals (in the form of Supreme Court decisions) and
subsidy for its organizational development. Fourth, in the wake of the
civil rights movement, the idea of rights attained a powerful cultural
status, making the political claims of legal liberals seem identical to morality,
progress, and common decency, a part of elite common sense.
Fifth, the rules of the game in American politics changed, in a way that
durably advantaged the resources of legal liberalism. Sixth, elite foundations
threw themselves behind the creation of the liberal legal support
structure, providing critical funding and strategic coordination for its
emerging infrastructure. By the early 1970s, these interacting factors
produced an imposing structure for the production of liberal legal goals,
one capable of sustaining legal liberalism’s momentum even as the electoral
status of its allies began to be challenged.
For much of its growth phase, legal liberalism was not a partisan project,
drawing support as it did from elite actors in both parties. By the
early 1970s, however, the party system was changing, as the issue context
and coalitional dynamics of American politics started to change. Starting
with Richard Nixon, Republicans began to recognize the value of assaulting
legal liberalism as a strategy for realigning the party system. Small
businessmen could be mobilized by resistance to the courts’ aggressive
decisions on environmental and health and safety regulation. Attacks on
judges for their decisions on abortion, busing, and affirmative action decisions
could be used to drive a wedge between urban ethnic Catholics and
RISE OF THE LIBERAL LEGAL NETWORK 57

more affluent, socially liberal Democrats. Southern Democrats who just
a few years earlier considered voting Republican a sin were attracted to
the party’s ranks by the Supreme Court’s decisions on prayer in schools,
desegregation, pornography, and abortion. At the same time, the Democratic
Party began to change, as the liberal legal support structure became
an ever-more important part of its elite stratum and its central commitments,
such as women’s, civil, consumer, and welfare rights and the environment,
came to rival the party’s older commitments to economic stabilization
and unions. In the new party system that emerged in the 1970s,
the liberal legal network became closely linked to the Democratic Party,
while the Republicans attracted Democrats repelled by legal liberalism.
In a telling example of this shift, Lewis Powell—who as president of the
ABA had helped advance the cause of legal liberalism—became the author
of a seminal report to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce calling for countermobilization
against public interest lawyers, and eventually a Nixon appointee
to the Supreme Court.162
While conservatives successfully used resistance to the courts to attract
converts to their cause, they quickly discovered that disentrenching legal
liberalism was an altogether more difficult matter. For example, in response
to a lawsuit by the Center for Law in the Public Interest that
stopped oil drilling by Armand Hammer’s Occidental Petroleum, Hammer
directly lobbied McGeorge Bundy to cut CLIPI’s funding, had his
lawyers contact CLIPI’s trustees, and campaigned to cut its tax exemption.
Despite being one of America’s richest men, he was wholly unsuccessful.163
The Nixon administration unsuccessfully sought to strip public
interest law of its tax exemption, and both Nixon and Reagan made efforts
to “defund the Left,” but were able to do so only at the margins.164
Conservatives slowly recognized that they needed to develop their own
apparatus for legal change, one that could challenge legal liberalism in
the courts, in classrooms, and in legal culture. How they did so, and the
difficulties that legal liberalism placed in their way, is the story to which
we now turn.

Conservative Public Interest Law I: Mistakes Made

OF ALL THE CASES of conservative legal mobilization examined in this
book, none was more difficult or characterized by greater trial-and-error
than public interest law.1 While each step in the development of the Federalist
Society and law and economics could build relatively smoothly on
earlier ones, in public interest law conservatives had to overcome the legacy
of their strategically inadequate initial response to legal liberalism.
This chapter traces out the early—failed—conservative response to legal
liberalism, the sources of its ineffectiveness, and the long process of strategic
reevaluation its failings engendered.
Faced with a deluge of lawsuits from Naderite and Ford Foundation–
supported public interest law firms it was far from obvious what response
might be effective, and the founders of conservative PILFs lacked the experience
and strategic sophistication to discover it. The conservative public
interest law structure they did devise, with firms cartelized geographically,
reactive to the agenda of legal liberalism, focused on amicus participation,
and compromised by close ties to regionally powerful businessmen, produced
meager results and was an obstacle to the emergence of more successful
organizations. The first-generation firms’ geographic focus and
close ties to business limited their ability to specialize, develop a “public
interest” reputation, and organize their litigation around a coherent set
of ideological principles. Ultimately, as I will argue in chapter 7, power
and decision-making in conservative public interest law passed from the
businessmen who were dominant in the first-generation firms to a second
generation of foundations, activist intellectuals, and conservative lawyers.
This new alignment of patrons and organizational-intellectual entrepreneurs
proved substantially more potent than their predecessors. This
chapter examines the period of organizational trial-and-error that began
in the early 1970s and continued well into the late 1980s. It sheds light on
three elements of conservative elite organizational countermobilization:
strategic errors driven by dominant movement interests and inappropriate
models for action, lags in response to failure, and organizational learning
through generational succession.
First, the conservative movement’s responses in the law were poorly
matched to available opportunities because of the interests, attitudes, and
experiences of its core constituencies. The most mobilized interest of con-
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 59

servatives in the early 1970s was business, a problematic ally for the cause
because of its unreliable opposition—and frequent support—for state activism.2
While businessmen often sincerely believed in the ideology of antistatism,
they commonly detached this belief from their day-to-day behavior.3
American businessmen also lacked the knowledge to effectively direct
countermobilization in professionalized and intellectually dense fields.
This close relationship with business put a taint on the movement, especially
in a period dominated by the idea of the “public interest.” Conservatives
were further hampered by strategies that seemed natural or appropriate
to its organizational entrepreneurs. Repertoires of action that the
movement had used with success in other areas (such as electoral politics)
were deployed in response to new problems, often without careful consideration
of their effectiveness in new domains, while those with a higher
probability of success were avoided because they violated strong collective
normative commitments. Responses that drew on existing movement
resources and organizational forms were preferred over those that required
innovation and the empowerment of new kinds of leaders. These
constraints help to explain why conservatives chose a geographically
based, business-led strategy poorly suited to the task of legal change.
Second, the same forces that caused the conservative legal movement
to devise a flawed organizational response to legal liberalism made rapid
readjustment difficult, rendering flawed strategies durable despite their
limited efficacy. While the market in interest group organization may
“clear” over time, in the sense that ineffective approaches will lose support
and more promising approaches will gain, the relationship between
organizational entrepreneurs and their supporters means that initial responses
may be very sticky. This relationship is likely to be characterized
by asymmetric information, as supporters may have a difficult time monitoring
organizational entrepreneurs and may not have a clear sense of
what constitutes “success” or how to measure it.4 As a result, inexpert
patrons may be vulnerable to the existing organizations’ self-interested
assessment of their effectiveness. Conservatives overcame this problem
over time, with the emergence of specialized patrons embedded in a network
with multiple information streams, but it took more than a decade
to do so.
Third, conservative movement leadership became more effective,
adaptable, and legitimate when there was a shift in power from the movement’s
material base to those with primarily cultural and intellectual motivations.
Organizational maintenance imperatives made it hard for incumbents
to learn from failure, so learning happened through the creation
of new organizations by “refugees” from the old. It is no accident that all
of the senior leaders of the second generation of conservative public interest
law worked at one time in first-generation firms.
60 CHAPTER 3

The Origins of Conservative Public Interest Law

The rise of liberal public interest law in the late 1960s and early 1970s
was seen by conservatives as deeply threatening. Liberal public interest
lawyers established critical precedents in high-profile areas of constitutional
law, threw obstacles in the way of conservatives’ governing agenda,
and used their superior organization, networks, and information to influence
policy outcomes through litigation and intervention in the regulatory
process (especially in the area of the environment). Conservatives’ initial
responses to the liberal legal network were direct reactions to all three of
these dimensions of the rise of public interest law.
The first causes of conservative countermobilization were changes in constitutional
law in civil rights, criminal procedure, and sexual and religious
freedom. Liberal public interest law organizations pushed the Court to use
constitutional provisions to liberalize policies and procedures, primarily at
the state level.5 These decisions threatened core conservative constituencies,
such as religious conservatives or defenders of racial segregation. Even
more ominously, they produced a shift in federalism, centralizing policymaking
in a system where conservatives had seen their interests served
by decentralization and separation of powers. Power was transferred from
Congress, where conservatives could count on considerable support, to the
Court, where they could not. Against these changes, conservatives initially
mobilized almost exclusively in the electoral arena. Richard Nixon ran for
president in 1968 promising to brake the Warren Court’s activism by nominating
“law and order” Supreme Court justices,6 and by 1972, as the quote
from Patrick Buchanan that graces this book’s introduction makes abundantly
clear, many conservatives believed he had succeeded.
Conservatives in government, especially Ronald Reagan during his stint
as governor of California from 1967 to 1975, found their agenda obstructed
by liberal PILFs, including those funded by the Legal Services Program.
Reagan ran for office on a program of welfare reform, but soon
found his changes challenged in the courts. Ronald Zumbrun, Reagan’s
deputy director for legal affairs in California’s Department of Social Welfare,
found that in defending Reagan’s welfare reforms in court, “we were
all by ourselves, with nobody to defend the program other than ourselves.
We felt we were on the side of the public interest.”7 The wave of environmental
public interest litigation provided an additional impetus to conservative
legal mobilization. Unlike their predecessors in the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund and the ACLU, these newer firms imposed large costs on
businesses, ranchers, and other conservative interests, both directly
(through regulation) and indirectly (by publicizing corporate wrongdoing,
damaging corporations’ reputations, and forcing defensive compliance).

Conservatives’ inability to protect their victories in the polling booth or
the profitability of corporate America without substantial representation
in the courts led to the creation in 1973 of the first conservative public
interest law firm, the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF).
PLF drew support from the California Chamber of Commerce, whose
members had become sensitized to the danger the public interest law
movement could pose to business by the success of the Wilderness Society,
Environmental Defense Fund, and Friends of the Earth in temporarily
halting the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in the early 1970s.8
One of those businessmen, J. Simon Fluor, brought his complaint to Los
Angeles lawyer (and future Reagan administration attorney general) William
French Smith, who put Fluor in contact with Zumbrun.9 The chamber
of commerce recognized that corporations were at a substantial disadvantage
in their battle with the liberal PILFs, as their in-house lawyers
could never devote themselves full-time to business’s collective interests.
Legal liberals could also organize, at a time when tax rates were very
high, through 501(c)(3) organizations funded by tax-exempt charitable
donations, while individual corporate lawyers were paid by taxable
funds. Drawing on his experience in government, Zumbrun hoped that
PLF could obtain support from consulting contracts with state governments
as well as financing from business.10 Mimicking the rhetoric of its
counterparts on the left, the Zumbrun-led PLF sought to represent the
“other side” of the public interest. Unlike its liberal predecessors, PLF
was created “not because they [conservatives] were disadvantaged in the
legislative or executive arenas, but because they viewed conservatives as
disadvantaged in the courts, where they believed that liberal firms had a
‘moral monopoly’ on the public interest.”11 PLF and its successors would
be a shield, not a sword.
The most notorious indication of business’s early strategic response to
legal liberalism is a memorandum solicited by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
written by soon-to-be Supreme Court justice and former ABA president
Lewis Powell. Powell argued that business faced a challenge to its
very survival, but that businessmen had “responded—if at all—by appeasement,
ineptitude and ignoring the problem.”12 Powell recommended
that the chamber of commerce hire a “highly competent staff of lawyers.
In special situations it should be authorized to engage, to appear as counsel
amicus in the Supreme Court, lawyers of national standing and reputation.”13
Powell assumed that business’s problem was representative disequilibrium
in the courts: when liberals were able to press their claims
without effective probusiness rebuttal, courts inevitably sided with them.
Powell did not propose that business use the law to create limits on government
activism, but sought a return to the New Deal–era tradition of
62 CHAPTER 3

judicial restraint that business found it could work with. It would be over
a decade before conservatives fully recognized that this tradition was beyond
resuscitation and business would have to work within the new legal
regime created by its adversaries.
The network of regional conservative PILFs that built off the experience
of PLF shared Powell’s strategic approach. PLF had expanded rapidly,
taking on a number of high-profile cases and raising money quite successfully.
PLF’s staff wanted to take the organization national by creating
branch offices across the country, a move that its board was afraid would
stretch it too thin.14 Leonard Theberge, a corporate lawyer who had been
active in the ABA and conservative causes,15 was asked by PLF’s supporters
to study the possibility of expanding the group’s work nationally. This
led to the founding, under Theberge’s leadership, of the National Legal
Center for the Public Interest, with the mandate of creating versions of
PLF in the other regions of the country.16 NLCPI originally operated out
of PLF’s offices in California, but soon moved to Washington, D.C.
NLCPI’s most fateful strategic choice was to organize PLF’s successors
geographically rather than functionally, a decision that flowed from PLF’s
previous plan to open branch offices. NLCPI’s founders also believed that
regional firms could draw on local pride and business networks and establish
their reputations through litigating issues of local importance. By
granting a local monopoly in fund-raising, these firms would have a
chance to grow without competing with their regional counterparts.17
This cartel system would be maintained by a system of interlocking directorships,
in which the president of NLCPI would serve on the firms’ board
and the presidents of the firms would serve on NLCPI’s board. This structure
was designed to prevent NLCPI from competing with its members
(in particular by starting to litigate cases) and the regional firms from
competing with each other (by allowing the president of NLCPI access to
information about fund-raising and case strategy only available to board
members). NLCPI would ensure that its members did not end up on opposite
sides and adjudicate “border disputes” between the firms. In short,
the network of first-generation public interest law was designed to stifle
interorganizational competition.
NLCPI experienced organizational turmoil almost as soon as its member
firms were created, with one faction of its board arguing it should go
out of business and another interested in giving it an ongoing purpose.
In 1979, former Ford administration assistant attorney general Michael
Uhlmann was asked by Theberge to take over the presidency of NLCPI,
a request that “had great appeal, especially in contrast to the commercial
‘dry as dust’ of private practice.”18 Uhlmann’s vision for NLCPI put him
into substantial conflict with the organization’s members:
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 63

I had not thought through a programmatic agenda for NLCPI when I took over
. . . it was enough for me then to be involved in trying to make a philosophical
and rhetorical case for “conservative” public-interest law. . . . By the time I
figured out what ought to be done, I could see that the NLCPI structure was
not particularly well suited to its accomplishment. NLCPI had all the structural
flaws of the Articles of Confederation—the regional entities wanted a weak
central organization. . . . What they wanted from “central” was a national
megaphone that would, from time to time, draw attention to their efforts, perhaps
testifying before Congress occasionally, holding “national” conferences,
etc. Above all, they wanted “central” to help them raise money, which would
in be turn be redistributed to the regionals. The unworkability of this formula
was compounded by the fact that most of the regionals were pretty thin entities
to begin with. In fact, they were little more than tiny law offices whose principal
function (as I later learned) consisted in filing amicus briefs within their bailiwicks.
. . . The only one of the regionals that had a serious agenda, or that could
make any serious claim to being a law firm, was Jim Watt’s Mountain States
operation, which tore a page from PLF and made itself into a force to be reckoned
with. The others were feeble operations, big on rhetorical enthusiasm
(which they would put forth before local business gatherings) but otherwise
lacking anything resembling strategic vision or a way to achieve it.

Uhlmann and NLCPI parted ways when it became clear that he wanted
it to abandon “coordinating” the behavior of regional firms and to go
into business as a full-time, national public interest law firm. There was
a powerful logic to Uhlmann’s plan, but it was precisely what NLCPI’s
was designed—effectively—to prevent.
Uhlmann was replaced by in 1980 by Ernest Hueter, the former CEO
of Kansas City’s Interstate Brands. Hueter was actively involved in the
Gulf and Great Plains Legal Foundation in Kansas City, later renamed the
Landmark Legal Foundation. Hueter was approached by Joseph Coors, a
fellow member of the National Association of Manufacturers’ board, to
replace Michael Uhlmann as NLCPI’s leader. Coors made clear that he
wanted NLCPI’s president to be a respected businessman, who could reestablish
businessmen’s support of conservative public interest law.19 The
replacement of Uhlmann, an experienced and ideologically motivated
conservative lawyer, with Hueter, a Midwestern businessman, was telling:
the organization took a step in the direction of Washington-based, intellectual-driven
leadership under Uhlmann and quickly jumped backwards.
This leadership role for business, along with the movement’s geographical
structure, would set the template for the conservative public interest law
movement’s first two decades.
64 CHAPTER 3

The Troubled First Generation

The experience for Chip Mellor and David Kennedy (who would go on
to found the Institute for Justice) at the Mountain States Legal Foundation
(MSLF) provides a useful case with which to examine the problems of the
first-generation conservative firms because the organization had substantial
advantages that its regional brethren lacked. MSLF was founded and
financially supported by Joseph Coors, the conservative beer magnate
who was also actively involved in building other parts of the movement’s
organizational apparatus in the 1970s. Unlike most of the other conservative
firms, MSLF had a happy coincidence of geographical and functional
differentiation: the states where it operated were those where public lands
and related environmental issues were most hotly contested, and where
the conservative legal movement’s position on them had the strongest
political support.20 David Kennedy, the chairman of MSLF’s Board of
Litigation,21 recalls that in the West there “was an enormous sense of
political disenfranchisement. Therefore, with the lessons taught by the
leftist activists of the sixties and early seventies in their use of the courts
to obtain results which they were unable to obtain politically, there developed
a movement to use the same tactics on behalf of more traditional,
more conservative, more libertarian causes.” Chip Mellor, a staff attorney
for MSLF and for a brief period its acting president,22 believes that this
geographically focused grievance strongly differentiated MSLF: “One of
the things that gave Mountain States an advantage that allowed it to be
set apart from and more successful than its sister organizations was that
it had a niche that it could successfully occupy and create an identity, a
funding source, and some jurisprudence around. The other entities, to a
greater or lesser extent, had a harder time developing a distinct identity.
That led to problems in funding and focus of mission.”
In its early years, MSLF had something else its sister organizations
lacked: a powerful, dynamic leader, the soon-to-become-notorious James
Watt. Watt drew attention to MSLF’s cases, giving the organization a
clear public presence, helping to attract talented lawyers to its staff, and
building the trust and support of its board. After Watt left in 1981 to
become Ronald Reagan’s secretary of the interior, however, the flaws in
the firm’s organizational structure and legal strategy, which had been hidden
under Watt’s charisma, were exposed. David Kennedy comments,
“When I compare . . . the quite carefully thought through and clearly
articulate mission of IJ [Institute for Justice] with the more rudimentary
thrust of MSLF, it’s pretty clear that MSLF was starting from a basic
complaint which was not carefully delineated or articulated.” MSLF
under Watt drew attention to its cause, but it was distinctly unsuccessful
in directly using litigation to influence public policy.
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 65

The root of MSLF’s difficulty in developing a coherent and effective
legal strategy was in the tensions between individual business interests
and conservative ideology—tensions that plagued all of the first-generation
conservative PILFs. MSLF’s board of directors was made up of three
CEOs from each state, “either CEOs of their self-made companies, or
mid- to upper-level executives with a larger corporation.”23 This leadership
structure was largely driven by financial considerations, as all members
of the board were expected to be either “financial contributors or at
least to be active in fund-raising.” Jefferson Decker has found that “in
correspondence, foundation employees often thanked contributors for
their ‘investment,’ not their ‘donation’ or ‘contribution’; fundraisers targeted
executives in specific industries and explained how Mountain
States’ legal work would ‘directly affect’ their cause.”24 In numerous cases
MSLF took the logic of “investment” literally, preparing amicus briefs in
support of its financial contributors.
The interests of local businessmen and the libertarian principles of
MSLF’s staff soon came into conflict with MSLF’s challenge to Denver’s
grant of an exclusive cable television franchise to William Daniels.25 Mellor
recalls, “It was a great lawsuit. It was right at the time that cable
television was in its infancy, and Denver was the cable capital of the
world, and this was going to be the showcase system to demonstrate the
potential of cable television to the world . . . [but] everybody was bought
off on this thing. The business establishment, the political establishment,
was very much behind it. But it was a violation of the First Amendment,
so we filed suit.” Mellor was answerable to a two-stage process within
the organization: a Board of Litigation made up of practicing lawyers
(who supported the suit) and the business-dominated board of directors.

Some of them loved it, but there was a contingent from Colorado who said,
“This is the wrong suit, you don’t want to do this suit.”. . . I was all for it,
Clint [Bolick] was all for it, my wife—she wasn’t my wife at the time—and our
chairman [at the Institute for Justice], David Kennedy, was on the Board of
Litigation, [future] Senator John Kyl, who was on the board. So we were all
fired up about it. But it gored the wrong ox, it gored very powerful interests
there, well connected to the Republican Party. The day we filed the lawsuit Joe
Coors resigned from our board. Joe . . . thought this was not a good thing. It
was not a cynical move on his part, and while he didn’t like the idea that it was
going to gore the people it was going to gore, he had much more of a feeling
that “this is not what I founded MSLF to do. I founded it to take on the Sierra
Club, not to do this sort of thing.”

The Denver cable case exposed the division between the orientation of
the businessmen on MSLF’s board of directors and its staff and Board of
Litigation. Reflecting the disconnect identified earlier between American
66 CHAPTER 3

businessmen’s beliefs and behavior,26 Daniels, a friend of Coors and the
potential head of the Denver cable monopoly

conceded that he understood and even sympathized with the principle which
the staff was asserting, but argued that we had to “live in the real world” and,
in the real world, municipal monopolies were the way it was going to be, so he
was there to try to take advantage of the opportunity. . . . They failed to persuade
this idealistic young organization that the real world had to be that way
and . . . couldn’t be changed. After all, we felt, that’s what the entire purpose
of this organization was, to change things from . . . the “unfair” status quo, to
an order more consistent with . . . individual liberty and freedom from improper
constraint, which we perceived as being all around us.27

Today, Mellor sees the Denver cable case as a “quintessential [Institute
for Justice] case ten years before we formed IJ,” but it didn’t turn out to
be an acceptable case for MSLF. “As the controversy and media coverage
increased, contributions to the legal foundation dropped, especially from
corporations. We persevered in court, but we were increasingly constrained
by the Foundation from making our case aggressively in the
media. Meanwhile, the screws continued to tighten on the funding front.
In the face of this, the Foundation decided to abandon the fight.”28
The MSLF experience taught Mellor lessons that he would spend the
next decade trying to apply. The most important lesson was that, first,

any organization worth its salt has to be dedicated to principle and not to expediency
and political forces. Second, that the board of directors has to fundamentally
understand the mission and be dedicated to that long-term mission, recognizing
that there are going to be setbacks and difficult decisions along the way.
Third, that fund-raising must never drive case selection, and you should never
be beholden to anyone and that you have to be able to call your own shots.
You have to gather around idealistic people who recognize the importance of
the fight you are engaged in and who will pursue it with a passion that will
allow you to have fun and overcome the obstacles.

The Denver cable case made it clear that free markets and business’s interests
were necessarily in tension. Conservative PILFs could not expect their
business base to stand up for libertarian causes when they damaged the
interests of specific firms. The key assumption of the first generation of
firms, that the welfare-regulatory state could be turned back by mobilizing
businessmen to defend their interests, failed under the stresses of reallife
litigation. It would take Mellor a decade before he could create a new
organization in which lawyers driven by ideology, rather than investors
motivated by profits, would be in the driver’s seat.

The Horowitz Report and the Problem of Business Influence

Mellor and Kennedy were not the only conservatives in the late 1970s
who realized that something was seriously amiss in conservative public
interest law. The most influential internal criticism came in a report to the
Scaife Foundation by Michael Horowitz29 that was subsequently distributed
informally to conservative donors and activists.30 The Horowitz Report
had a powerful effect on conservative foundations and legal activists.
Michael Greve, then a program officer at the Smith Richardson Foundation
and later a founder of the second-generation Center for Individual
Rights, recalls that

there had for some time been a lot of dissatisfaction among conservative foundations
about [conservative] nonprofit public interest law. . . . That didn’t mean
that all these places were losers. Some of them weren’t, some of them were quite
good. In general, there was a sense that the foundations had not gotten their
money’s worth.... There were reports that they had commissioned from outside
people who had looked at this stuff, which had pretty much [agreed on the
need for] specialization [and] more hardball litigation rather than amicus briefs.
The [most important] document is the Horowitz Report.

The wide distribution of the Horowitz Report primed conservative foundations
for new approaches and made them more skeptical of the projects
they were already supporting. As a study of conservative organizational
development in law prior to the 1980s and as an influence on it in later
years, the Horowitz Report is worth examining in detail.
Horowitz’s criticisms were direct and damning. “When visiting law
schools” Horowitz found that “young men and women are tired, as is
everybody, of the old answers. Yet, nobody has sufficiently offered young
lawyers the sense that one can be caring, moral, intellectual, appropriately
ideological, while at the same time being radically opposed to the stale
views of the left.”31 While opposed to the liberal public interest law movement’s
goals, he was impressed by how it placed “its efforts on a higher
moral plane than those of its adversaries and has thus engaged the loyalties
of young attorneys and the national media.”32 This insight suggested
the need to avoid a narrowly legalistic focus, instead attacking the “moral
monopoly enjoyed by traditional public interest lawyers and their allies,”
thereby convincing young lawyers that conservatism and the public interest
were not contradictions in terms. While the existing firms assumed
that equalizing the contest over the public interest was simply a matter of
who appeared in court, Horowitz recognized that the battle over the public
interest was an intellectual contest over meaning and the moral reputations
of ideological movements. Unable to compete at this higher plane,
68 CHAPTER 3

“The conservative public interest law movement will at best achieve episodic
tactical victories which will be dwarfed by social change in the
infinite number of areas beyond the reach of its case agendas.”33 The
conservative legal movement needed to stretch beyond the courts to the
institutions that supported legal activism and generated movement reputations
and intellectual distinction. Horowitz’s report thus pointed beyond
public interest law to the Federalist Society, of which he was an
early supporter.
In the battle to transform legal culture, Horowitz discovered that conservatives
were the victims of their greatest strengths, grassroots mobilization
and the support of local businessmen, which encouraged the conservative
public interest law movement’s geographic division of labor. He
observed, “The success of PLF led to the NLCPI model, which sought to
replicate the least significant (and somewhat accidental) aspect of PLF—
its regionally based character.”34 PLF’s geographical orientation was not
a secret to its success, but an obstacle, and certainly not a characteristic
to be replicated.

Washington is “where the action is” insofar as issues of public policy are concerned.
A conservative public interest law movement should of course have, as
one of its prime objectives, a radical alteration of that fact. Still, in maintaining
its regional orientation, the conservative public interest law movement has essentially
confused wish with reality, for it is in being more effective in Washington
that the conservative public interest law movement can more effectively
erode the power of its agencies . . . decision-making in Washington is, as is true
with all human institutions, dramatically effected [sic] by personal relationships
and ease of immediate access to decision makers.35

Conservatives had to adapt to the regime they sought to dismantle. That
regime, centered in Washington, with policymaking conducted in the
low-visibility, low-mobilization contexts of congressional committee
hearings, agency regulatory operations, and informal relationships with
interest groups and policy research organizations, foreclosed access to
power by those based elsewhere. The national media, with its influence
on the conventional wisdom of policymakers, was also based in Washington,
and so firms interested in shaping the media’s agenda and framing
of the issues needed to have ongoing relationships with the Washington-based
press. Situated far outside the Beltway, conservative PILFs
lacked the ability to nimbly respond to opportunities, access information,
and develop networks.
Even more important than this misdirected decentralization was the
privileged role of business in the movement, which hampered its ability
to seize the moral high ground and wage the battle of legal ideas. The
firms’ business-heavy caseload lent credence to their adversaries’ argu-
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 69

ment that, far from being defenders of the public interest, they were nothing
more than shills for conservative business interests. In fact, Horowitz
agreed with the factual basis of this criticism, noting that “all too often,
conservative public interest law firms serve as mere conduits by which
monies contributed by businessmen and foundations are given to private
law firms to assist it in the prosecution of ‘its’ cases. No practice presently
engaged in by conservative public interest law firms is more inappropriate.”36
The source of this problem was the businessmen on the firms’
boards, who saw their interests and that of conservatism as identical, and
thus saw no conflict in having conservative public interest firms do their
work for them.37
While this exposed the movement to claims of corruption and tax evasion,
Horowitz was more concerned that it led conservatives to miss opportunities
to influence the character of legal and policy debate. Those
opportunities went well beyond those of interest to business, including
social issues, poverty, and civil rights. Horowitz observed that there were
“an increasing number of situations where businesses will seek federal
support and subsidies to insure survival and to maximize their short-run
interests. In such situations, ‘conservative’ positions will often be adverse
to those of the businesses in question.”38 Businesses were highly riskaverse,
hesitant to alienate their stakeholders by taking strong, ideologically
charged stands, thereby producing “an adversarial confrontation
between one party seeking principled, ideological gain, while the other,
from the outset, seeks to limit losses, [a confrontation that] is inherently
one-sided insofar as issues of precedent are concerned.”39 Conservative
PILFs tended to reinforce this framing of the public debate, rather than
challenging it. Business’s leadership of the conservative legal movement,
Horowitz concluded, harmed broader conservative interests in the law
and was an obstacle even to its own long-term interests, and, as a result,
business should limit itself to a purely financial role in the movement.
Freeing the movement from business would allow it to reach out to
clients that fit the inherited framing of public interest law’s mission. “It
is clear,” Horowitz wrote, “that only law-action centers which speak for
such unrepresented parties as taxpayers, ultimate consumers and small
businessmen, and which take positions (which may or may not be joined
in by large corporations) against the growth of federal power and expenditures,
can sufficiently articulate principled ‘conservative’ positions with
a requisite measure of staying power and consistency.”40 To plausibly
speak for these unrepresented interests, control of the movement needed
to shift to lawyers with ideological and philosophical, rather than material,
motivations. “The very decline in power of the American business
community over the past decade, and the corresponding growth of a government-growth
oriented, anti-business, traditional public interest move-
70 CHAPTER 3

ment is perhaps the best evidence that the skills in the business community
are not well correlated with the skills involved in generating idealism and
enlisting the intellectual loyalties of bright young men and women.”41
Horowitz identified the university, rather than the corporation, as the
key site of competition in the law. Universities, especially their law
schools, Horowitz found, were the breeding ground of the liberal public
interest law movement, where ideas were produced, strategies hatched,
idealism shaped, and networks nurtured. Activists were motivated by
their professors, the judges they clerked for, and the heads of public interest
organizations, all of whom were motivated primarily by fundamental
ideas of justice. If conservatives wished to compete in the public interest
law arena, they needed to move their own intellectuals and entrepreneurs
to the fore, since the primary battle was in the market for talented law
school graduates. Links to law schools, rather than to business, were, as
a consequence, vital in constructing the leadership of conservative PILFs.
Once they hired talented young lawyers, conservative PILFs needed to
be able to stimulate them intellectually, which meant that “directors of
conservative public interest law firms must only be those people capable
of marshalling the enthusiasms of meaningful staffs.”42 These new leaders
would be quite unlike practical businessmen, comfortable in organizations
conducive to “an often impractical intelligence, a speculativeness of
mind, often unfocused thinking, exceedingly unstructured organizations
and the relative absence of hierarchy . . . the need for change in the above
direction in the style and character of many conservative public interest
law firms is not likely to be seen by many business leaders, but would be
insisted upon by academics and others more regularly in contact with
young men and women.”43 Even as conservatives were experiencing what
Horowitz saw as an intellectual renaissance, the conservative academic
community was nowhere to be seen in conservative public interest law.
An inability to appeal to law students’ idealism and organizational style
led to the recruitment of lawyers who were “appallingly mediocre,”44
graduates of lesser-known, regional law schools, with virtually no representation
from the top-tier schools that fed liberal PILFs. To solve this
problem, Horowitz wrote, “A dramatic change in the board and leadership
profiles of conservative public interest law firms is a necessary first
step, even at most successful conservative public interest law firms.”45
This was a repudiation of the dominant organizational model of the conservative
movement in the 1970s and a shift in priorities that would accelerate
in the 1980s as financial leadership of the movement shifted from
businessmen to conservative foundations.
Conservative firms faced yet another set of structural obstacles to effective
legal strategy, and these were the organizational maintenance impera-
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 71

tives that led to an unreasonable devotion of time and effort to activities,
especially amicus curiae participation, that had little or no impact on
legal or political outcomes. For Horowitz, business’s emphasis on “measurable
outputs” was a weakness where legal and intellectual combat
was concerned, as it produced incentives for furious but strategically
ineffective demonstrations of activity. Amicus briefs had the advantage
of being cheap and quick to prepare, thereby allowing firms to show
“participation” in a large number of cases, even when they were marginal
to the outcome of the case. While admitting that there were instances
where amicus participation made sense, Horowitz observed that
“a high ratio of amicus participations on the part of a conservative public
interest law firm raises a fair presumption that the firm is engaging in
pufferies intended for naı¨ve audiences of donors, and not truly doing
meaningful work.”46 That “naı¨ve audience” included businessmen and
the diffuse audience targeted by direct mail, which has an even more
limited ability to scrutinize the impact of groups they are asked to fund.
Once firms got into this organizational maintenance cycle, little time or
effort was left over for activities that might have had a significant impact
on law and politics. Later critics of the first generation, like Chip Mellor,
would trace even more serious consequences to the first generation’s
amicus addiction.47
Horowitz saw a target-rich environment for a conservative public interest
law movement freed from structural impediments, especially in institutions
controlled by liberals. Horowitz claimed that liberalism had become
“a powerful establishment in American society which, in the name of
speaking for the poor, has actually become the means of perpetuating the
power and well-being of a middle-class group of well-paid and highly
placed professionals, often through collusive and at times literally corrupt
involvements with sympathetic government agencies.”48 This populist
stance would allow conservatives to turn Naderite cultural resources—
antiestablishmentarianism, suspicion of concentrations of power, claims
of institutional self-interest, and temperamental populism—against liberal
institutions.49 This strategy would create opportunities for conservative
firms to destabilize their opponents’ material base and challenge their
claim to monopolize the representation of the public interest.
In addition to attacking large, unaccountable institutions, conservatives
could also draw on inherited understandings of public interest lawyering
by defending large, diffuse, unrepresented interests. Among the
issues Horowitz identified that would meet this criterion were the impact
of regulation on small business and consumers, pornography, gerrymandering,
deficit spending, and racial quotas. The specific issues were of
considerably less interest to Horowitz than their long-term political po-
72 CHAPTER 3

tential. Horowitz applied five basic tests of the attractiveness of an issue
for the movement, which were whether it would

1. produce desirable political effects, in the sense of attracting potential constituencies
for conservatism;
2. undermine the claim that liberals represented a trans-political public
interest;
3. have plausibility as a matter of the public interest rather than wealthy
private interests;50
4. exhibit idealism and provide an opportunity for conservatives to be seen
on the side of the “good guys,” which would also be useful for attracting
idealistic young lawyers;
5. foster desirable policy outcomes, in the sense of limiting government
power and empowering civil society.

While the business supporters of the first generation of public interest law
thought in terms of discrete cases, Horowitz thought in terms of longterm
political conflict, and judged cases by whether they weakened the
institutional entrenchment of liberalism, and strengthened conservative
organizations and causes.
Horowitz thought it especially vital for conservatives to represent clients
who would associate conservatives with the underdog, individuals
unjustly treated by large institutions, while simultaneously associating the
Left with malevolent, unresponsive concentrations of power. In particular,
conservatives needed to target “poor clients such as ghetto school children
affirmatively interested in the maintenance of internal school discipline”
and “ghetto public housing residents,” who wished to “reestablish order
in their neighborhoods.” These cases “would sharply engage a traditional
[liberal] movement which has essentially ignored the victims of ghetto
disorder in its defense of the intended subjects of public sanction.”51 It
would also help conservatives erase the stigma of racism and connect
conservative legal activism to the increasingly sophisticated scholarship
on race, poverty, and crime being produced by critics of the Great Society.52
This scholarship, which would soon come under the heading of “empowerment,”53
gave conservatives a plausible alternative on traditionally
liberal issues, allowing them to claim that their legal activism genuinely
represented the public interest better than did that of the Left.
The Horowitz Report’s short-term effect on foundation support for
conservative public interest law was primarily negative. In 1980, before
the Horowitz Report was released, the staff of the Olin Foundation believed
that the Southeastern Legal Foundation was “one of the better
conservative public interest law groups, and one that the Steering Committee
may want to support before the Scaife study [the Horowitz Report]
is out.”54 By the beginning of 1982, the Olin staff was considerably
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 73

less impressed, observing, “As the Horowitz report indicates, this is not
one of the more effective public interest law firms . . . staff recommends
rejection of this general support proposal.”55 In 1982 the Olin Foundation
responded to a grant request from the New England Legal Foundation
by observing that “its staff is small and its director . . . is forced to
spend most of his time fund-raising. Because of this, most of NELF’s
activity is limited to the filing of amicus briefs. A large number of amicus
briefs are impressive to potential supporters, but these generally have
little bearing on the outcome of litigation.”56 The Washington Legal
Foundation (WLF) also felt the sting of the Horowitz Report. While not
rejecting WLF’s 1982 proposal completely, the Olin Foundation staff
noted “WLF is more markedly a political organization than the other
public interest law firms . . . and has not as yet had much influence on
the legal profession itself. Horowitz also criticized WLF for using too
many amicus briefs . . . and spending a sizeable proportion of its budget
(about 15%) on direct mail.”57
The Olin Foundation staff had clearly absorbed the core of Horowitz’s
critique, both its more obvious points (such as the use of amicus briefs)
and its more subtle observations (such as the need for a more intellectual,
idealistic approach to law). As a result, funding for other first-generation
firms stagnated; it would be years before conservative foundations recovered
their enthusiasm for the field. In fact, conservative patrons’ skepticism
of the field persisted as late as 1992:

Staff is well aware of the Board’s reluctance to make new grants for conservative
public interest law organizations, and well aware of the good reasons for
this reluctance. The bright hopes of ten years ago that conservatives could create
effective counterparts to the liberal groups that have taken their policy agendas
to the courtroom, such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Sierra
Club, have produced more disappointments than successes. The loose network
of law firms has not been conspicuously effective, well-organized or stable.58

This experience was not wholly negative, since it primed the movement’s
patrons for new approaches to legal change. When a new generation of
organizational entrepreneurs, such as the Federalist Society and secondgeneration
PILFs, showed that they had learned Horowitz’s lessons, foundations
were ready and willing to fund them.

The Capital Legal Paradox

While Horowitz was unsparing in his attack on the conservative public
interest law movement, he made an exception for one firm: the Capital
Legal Foundation (CLF). CLF anticipated almost all the strategic and
74 CHAPTER 3

organizational innovations that were put into practice at the Center for
Individual Rights and the Institute for Justice a decade later, but collapsed
in on itself, despite its strategic foresight, just a few years after Horowitz’s
praise. This makes CLF a very valuable case, for two reasons. First, it
demonstrates that the failure of first-generation firms was due less to the
absence of an effective strategic template for conservative public interest
law and more to the unwillingness or inability of CLF’s counterparts to
recognize the superiority of its model and adapt their organizations accordingly.
Second, CLF’s eventual collapse demonstrates the substantial
constraints that the immature conservative infrastructure imposed on
even a firm with a strong and innovative strategy.
CLF was established at the same time as the other regional firms, and
was undistinguished until Dan Burt, a successful Massachusetts lawyer,
took the helm in 1979. As Jim Moody, his colleague at CLF, puts it, “It
was Dan with the vision, now best embodied at IJ, that government and
especially unwise regulation was there to basically help the established
and entrenched aristocracy with collateral damage to the ‘little’ people,
or the economically or politically unpowerful.” Burt brought a coherent
strategic vision to CLF, combined with a critique of the administrative
state that echoed the liberal public interest law movement that he had
once been a part of. CLF under Burt was more libertarian than its traditionally
conservative counterparts, giving it a framework that detached it
from business—a framework that, in fact, led it to take cases in which
business was being protected or subsidized at the cost of consumers.
CLF anticipated (and may have influenced) many of the critiques made
in the Horowitz Report. First, CLF was based in Washington, locating it
close to the national bureaucracy, media, opinion leaders, and lawmakers.
Second, CLF shared Horowitz’s conviction that conservative PILFs
needed to establish a principled image as the populist enemies of large
concentrations of power. This required a very different relationship between
case selection and fund-raising than that of other first-generation
firms. “Dan ran interference,” Moody said, “and made it very clear that
our positions and actions were to be guided by the merits and not by any
money-related concerns; he’d gladly sacrifice money for taking the right
position.”59 Third, through litigation, Burt’s book on the Nader network,60
and attacks on the nomination of Nader ally Reuben Anderson
to head the Administrative Conference of the United States, CLF argued
that liberal firms were compromised by their cozy and dependent relationships
with government, just as liberals had claimed that conservative firms
were illegitimate because of their ties to business. Fourth, CLF focused
on direct litigation as the route to long-term legal and policy change since,
as Moody recalls, “Dan’s vision [was] to directly represent clients as this
. . . leads to better control of issues, record, etc. [although it] is much
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 75

harder and more expensive.”61 For example, CLF defended a group of
homeworkers (the “Vermont Knitters”) against Department of Labor regulations
that threatened to put them out of business, attacked federal
agricultural marketing orders, and effectively challenged FCC content
and balancing rules in broadcast license renewal decisions.
This approach made CLF extremely popular with foundations and protected
it from the reconsideration of investment in first-generation firms
that occurred in the aftermath of the Horowitz Report. From the beginning,
the Olin Foundation was impressed with Burt, whom it saw in 1980
as a “very bright, aggressive, former Naderite who understands how the
Nader organizations work and uses the same tactics for conservative
causes,”62 and in 1982 as the head of “probably the most effective of
the conservative firms operating at the national level,” noting Horowitz’s
praise of the organization.63 CLF was regularly given the Olin Foundation’s
highest rating—a record no other public interest law firm could
match—and its budget increased steadily in the early 1980s even as other
conservative firms faced financial instability.
In 1982, CLF was presented with what seemed like a golden opportunity
to establish conservative public interest law as a force to be reckoned
with. General William Westmoreland was the subject of a 1981 CBS 60
Minutes segment that claimed he knowingly falsified reports of enemy
troop strength. Westmoreland believed the claim was libelous and
shopped his case to several high-profile lawyers, all in vain.64 At the same
time, Leslie Lenkowsky of the Smith Richardson Foundation (SRF) was
contacted by a friend at CBS News, who was “appalled” by what he read
in an article in TV Guide65 attacking the 60 Minutes report. According to
Lenkowsky, SRF “had been working with Burt, had paid for his Nader
book. And I passed the tip to him. He in turn spoke to Dick Larry at
Scaife, who contacted a D.C. PR man . . . who knew Westmoreland.” The
case was attractive because it promised to humble the “liberal media”
and present an opportunity for the Supreme Court to revisit its decision
in New York Times v. Sullivan, which set a very high bar for libel claims.66
In addition, there was a genuine moral offense at CBS’s reporting, shared
widely on the right at the time. Jim Moody “recall[s] vividly the sense of
outrage we all felt at the depth of the CBS lies, a truly calculated and
deliberate effort to rewrite history to a different agenda. Sure we knew it
would be [very difficult] but we just couldn’t in all conscience not take
the case,” even though they were aware that the case was a stretch for an
organization like CLF.
Before the case was tried Burt’s gamble looked like it would pay off.
Because of the damage inflicted by the TV Guide article, CBS was in the
uncomfortable position of needing to prove, in the words of its general
counsel, “that in fact your broadcast was well founded. And therefore
76 CHAPTER 3

you had to defend the journalism as well as the law. We were in a public
battle as well as a legal battle.”67 Although even CBS realized the case was
dangerous, Westmoreland did not play to CLF’s organizational strengths.
CLF had to raise money for Westmoreland as it tried the case, a distraction
even for an experienced libel lawyer, which Burt was not.68 Exacerbating
CLF’s competitive disadvantage was CBS’s extremely talented
and well-funded legal team headed by David Boies of Cravath, Swaine.
Despite these disadvantages Burt embarrassed CBS in the court of public
opinion prior to the trial, using the discovery process to pry embarrassing
documents out of CBS, including an internal investigation (the “Benjamin
Report”) critical of the program.69 Burt’s aggressive handling of pretrial
publicity and his promise that “we are about to see the dismantling of
a major news network”70 made him a cause ce´le`bre in the conservative
movement.71
Partially due to Burt’s less-than-stellar performance in court, the case
concluded with a disappointing settlement in which CBS granted Westmoreland
neither money nor a retraction or admission of guilt. Despite
this, Moody believes the case was a success, as “the discovery and scholarship
associated with the case proved CBS lied and did so deliberately in
a very agenda-driven and deceptive way, violated many of its own internal
news guidelines. Westy’s reputation was vindicated, even without the payment
of damages.” On the other hand, after investing the largest sum of
money ever put into a conservative public interest law case, CLF obtained
a meaningless settlement that made it difficult for the firm to argue that
the case had been a success.
CLF’s failure at the trial stage points beyond the firm to problems with
the entire conservative legal movement at the time. First, CBS was a prestigious
institution with extremely deep pockets and the finest legal defense
money could buy. CLF, on the other hand, had to raise enormous sums
of money for the case, since it lacked the pro bono assistance of a large
private law firm, while also conducting the litigation and directing the
public relations that went along with it. A more experienced and betterfunded
firm would have used the Westmoreland case to embarrass CBS
through the discovery process and then moved it into the less resourceheavy
appeals process, where it could focus narrowly on enticing the Supreme
Court to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan. CLF, despite very
heavy fund-raising, could not even fully cover the cost of the trial itself.
While many observers at the time accused Burt of being outlawyered by
Boies into accepting a vacuous statement by CBS, by the time the trial
concluded it was clear that Westmoreland was going to lose. Therefore,
going to the jury and getting an unfavorable verdict only made sense if
CLF was prepared to invest the next few years in the appeals process. It
would have been nearly impossible for CLF to survive long enough to do
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 77

so. By the time the case concluded, without even going to appeal, CLF
was $400,000 in debt and had suffered reputational damage from the
popular (if not wholly accurate) sense that Burt had mishandled the case.
Michael Greve concludes that “Dan Burt bet a terrific outfit on Westmoreland—and
lost.” The fact that CLF’s very existence was at stake in a single
case underlines the difficulty PILFs faced in litigating highly fact-intensive
cases against large, well-defended institutions without the ability to draw
on the free resources from lawyers in private practice.
The failure of CLF in the Westmoreland case also points to two strategic
problems that conservatives would confront over the next few years.
First, the case was based on the theory that the dominant media could
be shamed or litigated into what conservatives thought was more dispassionate,
less ideological reporting. The Westmoreland case showed that
CBS would stand up against attempts to alter its reporting through libel
actions, and the public relations from the case did not seem to put a dent
in the popularity of 60 Minutes. As a consequence of the seeming futility
of this strategy, conservatives began to focus on developing their own
alternative media, supporting campus newspapers, the Washington
Times, and, a decade later, the Weekly Standard and Fox News. This
strategy would pay substantial dividends by the 1990s, in a way that the
strategy of critique never did. Second, the Westmoreland case points to
the lack of depth within the conservative movement at the time and the
difficulty in maintaining a legal movement without the support of an
effective professional insurgency. While Dan Burt may have been one of
the best conservative legal minds at the time, he was wholly inexperienced
in libel law. Today, as a result of the networks created by the Federalist
Society, a high-profile personality such as Westmoreland with an
exciting case could attract at least a handful of talented lawyers with
experience in libel law, ready and willing to provide their skills and the
resources of their firm.72 In the early 1980s, when the Federalist Society
was in its infancy, no such network existed, which explains why CLF
got the case in the first place.
While the fallout from the Westmoreland case and Burt’s desire to return
to private practice killed CLF, it would be too easy to write it off
with the rest of the first-generation firms. In fact, as argued earlier, CLF
had a strategic design and litigation strategy that resembles the best of the
second-generation conservative firms. Beyond its own achievements, CLF
also recognized many of the legal opportunities that the Institute for Justice
and the Center for Individual Rights took advantage of half a decade
later. Still reeling from the failure of Westmoreland, Burt in 1985 presented
an ambitious plan for the future of CLF to the Olin Foundation
that proposed a new initiative to attack “self-help barriers” created by
government, drawing on the then au courant idea of “empowerment.”
78 CHAPTER 3

While CLF could not get this initiative off the ground, the general approach
and justification for the project were identical to those proposed by CIR
and IJ years later. CLF argued that the issue of poverty could provide conservatives
with legal traction, positive public relations, and the potential to
embarrass liberals. “In short,” wrote Burt, “many of the regulations aimed
at ‘helping’ or ‘protecting’ the poor in fact perpetuate a culture of dependency
that deprives them of the skills they need to enter the mainstream of
our society.”73 CLF would use the law to win tangible victories for the poor
and demonstrate the idea that government action itself was responsible for
persistent poverty. Reflecting Horowitz’s insights, CLF claimed that legal
activism could influence popular ideas and reshape the conventional wisdom.
In its last years, CLF also proposed other initiatives that would be
fully developed by later law firms. It proposed to defend “the right to practice
your profession,” which, along with the Vermont Knitters case described
earlier, has remarkable similarities to the “Ego Brown” case (defending
a black Washingtonian’s right to shine shoes) that made Clint
Bolick’s name at the Landmark Legal Foundation and the Institute for Justice.74
This suggests that conservative public interest law in the early and
middle 1980s did not lack strategically sound legal opportunities, but was
faced with insurmountable organizational problems in establishing the resources,
networks, and tactics to match its ideas.
Not long before CLF closed its doors, Burt, at the prompting of Richard
Larry of the Scaife Foundation, addressed the question, “Is There a Future
For Conservative Public Policy Litigation?” Not surprisingly, Burt’s answer
was a qualified yes. He admitted that even the best of the first generation
of conservative litigation was not designed primarily to change the
law. “Although we won most of our court and administrative litigation
. . . many of these cases were brought to change attitudes, and raise
money. Indeed almost all conservative public policy litigation to date has
been brought to change public and judicial attitudes, since this is a prerequisite
to changing the law, and with an eye to their fund raising appeal.
. . . What we need to do now is convert these changes in attitude into
changes in law.”75 Burt observed that five years of Reagan appointments
to the bench meant that the opportunity to change the law existed in a
way that it did not a few years earlier. Anticipating Charles Epp’s arguments,
Burt argued that changes in the composition of the courts would
lead to only limited legal consequences without corresponding shifts
among conservative litigators.

Judges don’t legislate, they must have specific cases before them to rule on. The
new attitudes toward welfare, entry barriers and so on cannot become part of
our law, cannot be institutionalized, if the disputes that arise when these attitudes
clash with the laws of the last 50 years are not brought before the new
judiciary. The policy litigators must turn from the high visibility, big press cases
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 79

of the last eight years and bring repeated cases in their area of special concentration,
which they are prepared to litigate and relitigate until they change the
law. . . . CLF has done this in a number of areas—most notably in the field of
agricultural marketing orders. But as you know from that fight, it is long, arduous,
and often undramatic labor. . . . In the process we have also raised marketing
orders as an issue in the press and with the public. At the same time we hurt
our fund raising in two ways. First Sunkist, our chief opponent in the marketing
order fight, urged our corporate contributors to stop supporting us. I reckon
they cost us $75,000 or so a year. Secondly, the issue wasn’t “sexy,” and did
not attract individual or “gut” conservative money.76

Finally, Burt concluded that business could not be mobilized to defend
free markets. In fact, as seen by CLF’s efforts to eliminate agricultural
marketing orders (a New Deal–era policy establishing production quotas)
business could be the conservative movement’s most determined foe.

Corporate America never had a long term view of public policy litigation. It
sought relief from an immediate problem, and that happened. The Reagan years
have taken the immediate public pressure off the business world, and hence
eliminated the pressure to support policy litigation. Thus the policy litigators
have seen a substantial part of their funding disappear. This has been especially
serious to CLF, since its program never included litigation aimed at pleasing
business, as opposed to supporting free markets. For example, a long-time CLF
corporate contributor cut its contribution from $20,000 to $5,000 in the last
two years. Its public policy executive told one of our directors before the last
cut: “You’ll have to take more cases that appeal directly to the business community
if you want our support.” . . . The general public [through direct mail] will
fund highly visible attacks on liberal “sacred cows,” but it will not sustain a
large, careful slog through the courts that results in fundamental, long range
legal change. It will not do so because this sort of fight is undramatic, subtle,
and not easily understood.77

CLF clearly understood the organizational bind that faced conservative
public interest law, but had no answer to it beyond a request that conservative
foundations substantially increase their support. CLF recognized
the solution to the problems of conservative public interest law, but it
would take a new generation of firms, and the deepening of the conservative
support structure, to take advantage of this strategic breakthrough.

Charting a New Course

Chip Mellor moved on from the Mountain States Legal Foundation to
the Department of Energy, a thankless task for a libertarian, while his
colleague Clint Bolick went to work in the Reagan administration in
80 CHAPTER 3

Clarence Thomas’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Government
service was a part of neither’s long-range plans, but developing
an invigorated form of conservative public interest law was. Starting
in the mid-1980s, and drawing on Horowitz’s critique and their own
experience, Bolick and Mellor began to devise a strategy and an organizational
design to guide a new generation of conservative PILFs. This
process would produce many of the insights that Bolick and Mellor drew
on in founding IJ, influence the future leadership of CIR, and convince
conservative patrons that public interest law was not an intrinsically
futile project.
Before they left the Reagan administration, Mellor and Bolick began
planning a law firm, the “Center for Constitutional Litigation.” Their
original planning documents are striking in their scant emphasis on “judicial
restraint,” which was still dominant in conservative jurisprudence,
and their insistence that courts should energetically protect a libertarian
understanding of constitutional liberties.

In the American system of government, the courts are designed to safeguard
basic liberties against the passions of the other branches of government. Unfortunately,
the judiciary has abandoned this vital responsibility while assuming
the role of a super-legislature, imperiling those very individual rights with
whose protection it was entrusted. Leading this effort is a highly sophisticated
advocacy movement with a well-defined legal and social agenda. The philosophy
of this movement now permeates legal academia and much of the judiciary,
and no effective, principled alternative has yet been developed to challenge its
agenda. Thus, any comprehensive movement to advance liberty must include
as a vital component an organization designed to restore and expand judicial
protection of these principles.78

Bolick and Mellor recognized that their opposition was a well-organized
liberal legal network rather than a disconnected set of cases. Countering
that network required a serious intellectual critique, principled constitutional
philosophy, and organizations capable of acting across the entire
range of venues that feed into legal change. With the MSLF experience
clearly on their minds, Mellor and Bolick declared that “the Center’s efficacy
in achieving this goal is directly dependent upon its steadfast commitment
to principle and rejection of simple expediency. This requires methodical
effort with a long-range strategy to be implemented through
carefully developed litigation. The Center and its supporters must be prepared
to make a long-term commitment.”79 Making that long-range strategy
a reality required that the proposed firm’s patrons eschew using public
interest law to achieve their short-term economic or political interests in
order to facilitate their long-term interests in a constitutional order of
limited government. The keys to stretching out the firm’s time horizon
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 81

were severing fund-raising from case selection and identifying patrons
who would accept outcomes from litigation campaigns years or even decades
out.
Bolick and Mellor identified a range of areas ripe for litigation, such
as civil rights, free enterprise, property rights, contracts, torts, education,
and telecommunications. They had no doubt that the opportunity structure
for conservative litigation was permissive, but it could not be exploited
without significant strategic and organizational innovation.
Their first innovation was to be strategic rather than reactive, selecting
issues “in concert with movement think-tanks, academicians, and legal
experts,” focusing on concerns that had the greatest potential for creating
useful precedent, rather than those of interest to their donors. This
strategy would bring conservative intellectuals closer to the center of
legal activism than they had been in the past, and require that the firm’s
lawyers be informed by and contribute to scholarship. A close relationship
between intellectuals and lawyers was essential since “in some mission
areas, it will be necessary to lay extensive scholarly groundwork
before litigation is commenced. . . . One of the Center’s most important
functions will be to produce law review articles, to sponsor and provide
speakers for law-related seminars, to work in concert with other legal
scholars, and to coordinate with think tanks within the movement. Such
an approach will ensure the intellectual integrity of the Center’s program
and of the precedents it successfully establishes.”80 This intellectual orientation
reflected the lessons of the Horowitz Report (which they knew
potential grant-makers would have read) and the insight that a clearly
defined, intellectually informed strategy was an organizational maintenance
device: the clearer the principle upon which litigation was based,
the less risk of being pushed and pulled by short-term considerations or
pressured by patrons.
Bolick and Mellor’s second innovation was to organize the proposed
firm functionally by issue instead of geographically by region. This change
reflected a crucial lesson they had learned from the Left, which was the
need for careful, strategic client selection. Despite the fact that conservatives
had previously criticized the Left’s “venue shopping,” Bolick and
Mellor recognized that this was essential in using law strategically to produce
large-scale change. “After a strategy is devised, the Center will typically
initiate litigation in multiple jurisdictions. This approach will increase
the likelihood that favorable fact-situations and forums can be
found, and that a conflict may emerge among the circuit courts leading
to possible resolution by the Supreme Court.”81 The more functionally
specialized the organization, the more regionally opportunistic it could
be. The first generation of firms made the opposite calculation, being functionally
promiscuous but regionally focused.
82 CHAPTER 3

The 1985 proposal never made its way to any potential funder, but it
was a critical step in the development of the second generation of conservative
public interest law. Mellor presented the proposal to David Kennedy,
who, “in his gentle but firm way . . . convinced us that we weren’t
there yet in having really thought it through enough or in having the
management and fund-raising experience to pull it off.”82 At the same
time, Mellor was recruited from the Reagan administration by Anthony
Fisher, the patron of a far-flung network of think tanks in the United
States and abroad, to head the Pacific Research Institute (PRI). Mellor’s
move to PRI, soon after the 1985 proposal was written, gave him an
opportunity to “try to develop and focus the concept further while learning
how to manage and fund a nonprofit,” and a home for a new project,
the Center for Applied Jurisprudence (CAJ), that became the principal
planning tool for the Institute for Justice.
The original grant proposal for CAJ, sent to all of the major foundations
on the right, began with a forceful call for change in the conservative
legal community. The proposal made clear that “the courtroom is and
will continue to be a policy arena, regardless of President Reagan’s success
in transforming the judiciary.”83 Success in elections and the consequent
appointment of judges would not transform the courts, because the legal
liberal movement, “unlike the conservative movement[,] has developed
a cohesive and pragmatic ideological program with support from legal
academia, supplemented through a sophisticated public interest law network.”
Liberals compensated for their declining electoral power through
a powerful network of legal organizations, while the absence of a similar
network on the right meant conservatives failed to capitalize on their increasing
power over judicial appointments. As Horowitz had also observed,
the conservative firms that did exist were notably ineffective.

Conservative public interest law organizations were, and in some important
cases continue to be, a significant first step in advocating concepts of free enterprise,
private property rights, and individual freedom in the courtroom. But the
effectiveness of conservative public interest law has been impaired by at least
three factors: 1) the need to learn on the job since it was a new approach to
advocacy; 2) an ad hoc, uncoordinated approach to case and tactics selection,
guided generally by conservative principles, but rarely as part of a comprehensive,
philosophically consistent long range strategy; and 3) a “discomfort factor”
toward such litigation in the general legal community and among judges.84

Mellor told conservative patrons that the firms they supported were insufficiently
intellectual and principled and that their meager long-term impact
was a function of their reactive posture, defined as they were by their
opposition to the Left rather than their own vision of social justice. A
clearer set of principles would allow conservatives to set the legal and
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 83

political agenda and define the terms of public debate. In what amounted
to movement heresy at the time, the proposal embraced a proactive stance
for conservative litigators and an assertive role for federal courts. This
was bitter medicine for a movement raised on “judicial restraint” and
“strict construction,” but it was necessary if conservatives were to cease
the futile exercise of playing defense in the federal courts. Consequently,
the CAJ proposal recognized the necessity of convincing conservative
judges and executive branch officials, who had grown up under these
older ideas, to accept the unfamiliar and seemingly exotic sources of doctrine
that this new generation of litigators would present in court. Without
establishing the intellectual weight and coherence of these ideas outside
of court, in the institutions where legal norms are legitimated, they
would produce limited results on the inside, even from judges with a conservative
temperament.
The CAJ proposal emphasized the project’s intellectual dimensions, in
particular the prominent legal scholars who would participate.85 This was
a sign of the conservative legal movement’s maturation. Assembling a
group of prominent conservative legal theorists and lawyers with government
experience would have been almost impossible a decade earlier, but
by the mid-1980s the conservative movement had developed a cadre of
activists and thinkers whose primary commitment was to a set of ideas
rather than the defense of particular interests or constituencies. Their
common belief was that advancing the conservative legal movement required
the elaboration of conservative ideas rather than the further mobilization
of conservative interests. Idealism was strategy.
The CAJ proposal assembled three task forces of intellectuals and lawyers:
on the First Amendment, on economic liberty and civil rights, and
on property rights. Papers written by the chair of the task force laid out
the issues at stake in the area, which were then critiqued by the task force
and its collective judgment assimilated into a book. While the books
would be the responsibility of the authors alone, the process was designed
to build consensus within the movement. As Mellor recalls, the purpose
of organizing the task forces was

to create a buzz, to get people excited about what we were up to, then to enlist
the involvement of these scholars and recognized authorities in their respective
areas. I wanted to grow our own talent; I didn’t want to bring in someone who
was already recognized as having this scholarship or this point of view, so all
we were doing is giving an old dog a new platform. I wanted to get something
new and dynamic going that would shake up the tradition a little bit and draw
upon the good ideas from a variety of different people. So bringing those authorities
in got us their expertise, but it also got them invested in our success.
They . . . became . . . very excited about this. Many of them . . . have continued
to play important roles in the Institute for Justice.
84 CHAPTER 3

These books would combine substantive legal and policy arguments with
strategic judgments about how to organize a legal campaign. In particular,
the books would emphasize:

1. Model case development including possible timing, forum, ideal parties,

and appellate considerations
2. Timing and placement of significant law review articles and related
publications
3. Exposure and debate in the legal community, academia, and the general
public
4. Cooperation with other groups or endeavors, e.g. law and economics, the
Federalist Society, Institute for Humane Studies, and conservative litigation
groups86

CAJ’s proposed legal strategy integrated the transformation of legal culture
and ideas with strategic public relations and coalition building. Cases
and legal strategy would be chosen for maximum public impact in areas
that held the potential to attract new groups to the conservative fold.
Michael Greve, at the time the program officer at the Smith Richardson
Foundation in charge of the CAJ grant, recalls that “the SRF grant unquestionably
demonstrated that Chip is a very good fundraiser. What’s
more, he made good on the grant. . . . That undoubtedly helped him to
establish IJ.” CAJ not only helped Mellor think through the organizational
and strategic questions in public interest law, it also demonstrated
to the foundation community that he was capable of organizing and delivering
on a major project—thereby helping to alleviate suspicions inherited
from the Horowitz Report among conservative patrons of public interest
law entrepreneurs. The CAJ had a broader impact than laying the foundation
for IJ, as it influenced the thinking of the larger conservative network.
Greve recalls, “The sessions I attended were on First Amendment and
Equal Protection. Former mostly on commercial speech; dominated, intellectually,
by Mike McConnell and Lillian BeVier. Latter dominated by
Clint Bolick, then still on a racial neutrality riff. [There was] lots of advice
(from Jeremy Rabkin, Nathan Glazer, yours truly) to get off it and to push
‘black entrepreneurship’ instead.” While Bolick would continue to push
race neutrality in his publications, IJ followed the advice of the CAJ task
force in its actual litigation. The CAJ networking was important for Greve
as well. The early CIR grant proposals stressed his participation in the
CAJ’s task forces, and noted that “CIR’s Directors have spoken with William
(‘Chip’) Mellor, PRI’s President, and he has agreed to make the PRI’s
Task Force strategies available to the CIR.”87 This sent a signal to conservative
patrons that money invested in CIR would not lead to a reprise of
the errors made by earlier firms.
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 85

Just as important were CAJ’s more diffuse impacts. “What I really got
out of it was a confidence builder,” says Mellor. “It’s not that I knew all
the legal issues, I didn’t by a long shot, but I expected to learn those. What
I was really in need of at that time was the reassurance that there was
fertile ground there. . . . I needed confirmation, but they told me it was
even more fertile than I realized.” Speaking of CAJ, Greve argues that

the original project [didn’t] dictate any particular result, position, or even emphasis.
For example, Clint [Bolick] later wrote a screed against local “Grassroots
Tyranny,” which is light years from my own and CIR’s perspective on
federalism and local government. More significantly, perhaps, IJ would never
represent the people CIR represents, but behind that product differentiation
lays the judgment that you’ve got to get back to the constitutional norms. So
in that sense, the project really was a marker.

The search for a new strategy of conservative public interest law that
began with the Horowitz Report culminated with the CAJ project, giving
the movement’s organizational entrepreneurs the confidence to set up new
firms, and its patrons the confidence to fund them.

Idealism as Strategy: The Strategic Vision behind the Institute for Justice

The most important book to emerge from this project was Clint Bolick’s
Unfinished Business: A Civil Rights Strategy for America’s Third
Century.
88 At Clarence Thomas’s EEOC, Bolick had been deeply involved
with the development of conservative thinking on civil rights.
After leaving government he moved to the Landmark Legal Foundation,
where he put the CCL and CAJ framework into action, pursuing libertarian
goals with clients, including African-Americans, who were not
typically associated with conservatives. Drawing on this experience,
Bolick developed an argument that prefigured the strategy behind all of
IJ’s most prominent cases.
Unfinished Business was relentlessly optimistic in tone, highly sanguine
about the role of the judiciary, and characterized by a total lack of defensiveness
that was both temperamental and strategic. Bolick argued that
“a strategy that consists mainly of resisting the civil rights establishment’s
agenda is by nature a losing strategy . . . a reactive posture allows the
other side to define civil rights in terms of its own agenda and to claim
the moral high ground.”89 Bolick embraced the empowerment fad popular
among a handful of younger Beltway conservatives while also distancing
himself from the mainstream of the conservative movement, evidence
for which was Bolick’s quoting of Stuart Butler that “confidence is not
engendered [among black Americans] by conservative attorneys chasing
86 CHAPTER 3

firetrucks to see if any members of the Teamsters Union are upset about
affirmative action.”90 Bolick understood that in civil rights, perhaps more
than in any other area, an image of goodwill was a precondition for having
conservatives’ intellectual argument taken seriously.

Those who have resisted the civil rights policies of the past quarter-century have
been accused, often justly, of offering no alternative. The lack of a coherent,
credible, and comprehensive alternative leaves us in the untenable position of
arguing either that all of our nation’s civil rights problems have been solved or
that the major civil rights issue of our time is the plight of white firefighters
victimized by reverse discrimination. If that is our response, our detractors may
be excused for calling into question our commitment to civil rights.91

The repetition of the “white firefighter” trope is illuminating. Bolick
took as axiomatic the modern activist state’s assumption that policies
need to be justified in terms of their impact on less privileged groups.
Sixty years of government activism had shifted the ground of politics,
and so, for conservatives’ argument for limited government to be heard,
they would have to justify their policies against the standards of their
liberal opponents.
While Bolick did not argue against opposing affirmative action (he
would later become famous for calling Lani Guinier the “quota queen”),92
he claimed that the conservative cause on civil rights was better served by
identifying blacks, not whites, as its beneficiaries. Even if this strategy did
not advance Republican electoral fortunes, it would produce clients with
“stories” more compelling to the courts and the media. While a client’s
racial identity should be irrelevant from a conservative point of view, Bolick
argued that “given limited resources, public interest litigators should
represent the most disadvantaged individuals and should try whenever
possible to find a plaintiff whose plight outrages people.”93 He claimed
the authority of the civil rights movement as justification for his emphasis
on an affirmative role for federal courts. Against the conservative consensus
in favor of judicial restraint, Bolick asserted that

as our nation’s founders recognized, the legislative and executive branches are
especially susceptible to majoritarian and special interest influences. Since civil
rights are by definition individual rights . . . the ultimate guardian of those
rights, when the other branches of government have failed adequately to protect
them, is the judiciary. I recognize how imperfectly the judiciary has provided
that protection to date . . . but those considerations, it seems to me, speak in
favor of increasing our activities in the courts rather than diminishing them.94

Bolick called, without apology, for judicial activism, on the grounds that
liberals could not be defeated by putting the activist court genie back in
the bottle. In sharp contrast to the visionaries who inspired the first-
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 87

generation conservative PILFs such as the Pacific Legal Foundation, Bolick
claimed that success would come only through judicially enforced
constitutional rights, which could act as a counterweight against the
“majoritarian and special interest influences” that preserved liberal policy
preferences.
Bolick extended the CAJ proposal’s argument that public interest lawyers
needed to establish clear long-range goals, and to judge “every individual
case . . . against those principles and goals to keep the program on
course. Otherwise, the public interest law firm becomes just another law
firm.”95 Bolick had learned from the Left that victories in court that established
no clear precedent for future cases could set the movement back,
while “defeats can advance the strategy by creating splits among jurisdictions
(thus increasing the odds of Supreme Court review), by providing
guidance in fine-tuning strategy, and by creating public support that may
translate into future triumphs.”96 For conservatives to counter the Left in
court, they needed to establish “counterrights” of their own, with precedential
value that could push back the scope of governmental intervention.97
An amicus strategy, even if successful, could only stop assertions
of liberal rights in particular cases. A more powerful strategy was to use
the law as a sword rather than a shield, expanding the judicially recognized
meaning of the First Amendment and the takings clause, for example,
to put liberals on the defensive. Conservatives of the second generation
had a few examples of this approach, none more powerful than the
Pacific Legal Foundation’s successful litigation in Nollan v. California
Coastal Commission, which applied the takings clause of the Constitution
to government conditions on the use of property.98 Nollan signaled that
conservatives could do more than play defense, that the newly reshaped
federal courts would allow them to create counterrights of their own.
The final, and, for organizational purposes, most important insight that
Bolick (drawing heavily on Mellor’s experience and judgment) presented
in Unfinished Business was the centrality of organizational design. Opportunities
were not enough if they were squandered by short-term organizational
maintenance imperatives.

It is absolutely essential that groups dedicated to such goals understand the
respective roles of fundraising and case selection. Funds are raised to support
the cases—not vice versa. This rule is critical not only for the organization’s
integrity, but also for the mission’s success. While no public interest group can
afford to overlook funding realities, allowing such concerns to dictate or heavily
influence case selection confused ends with means. . . . Too often, public interest
law firms have lost sight of their original goals, ultimately viewing the perpetuation
of their particular programs as ends in themselves and engaging in mercenary
tactics to advance their programs even at the costs of the very principles
88 CHAPTER 3

that are their reason for existence. Such organizations are not only worthless,
they detract from those who are sincerely committed to principles by diverting
scarce resources and by fostering cynicism about the entire movement.99

By learning from the Left and from their own experience of the dynamics
of legal strategy, and combining these lessons with an organizational form
capable of supporting those lessons, conservatives could make the courts
into a powerful instrument for political change.

Conclusion

The sources of the first generation’s ineffective reaction to the rise of
legal liberalism can be found in the character of the conservative movement
in the 1970s. Conservatism’s strengths were its activists at the state
level, especially its network of small to medium-sized businessmen.
These assets were electorally potent, since the federal character of Congress
and the Electoral College mirrored the movement’s resources. The
changes in American politics described in chapters 1 and 2, however,
devalued those resources when it came to legal and policy change. In
this new regime, conservatives had few resources appropriate to the system
they sought to influence, which privileged ideas, legal tactics, access
to Washington networks, and the ability to influence the mass media. In
this regard, conservatives compared poorly to the Left, whose assets
were precisely those rewarded by this new political system. The new
American political system was well adapted to influence by the “new
class” of intellectuals and professionals, a class in which conservatives
were all but entirely unrepresented.
Conservatives were also hampered by their alliance with the business
community. Conservatives had counted on business, whose bottom lines
were being attacked by liberal public interest law, to be the natural constituency
for countermobilization. What they had not anticipated was the
way that American business had adapted to the structure of the activist
state. America’s business leadership had learned to make the expansion
of government activity work for them, or at least to minimize its impact
on their bottom line. Both Mellor and Kennedy at MSLF and Burt at CLF
recognized that business’s interest in keeping its access to anticompetitive
arrangements could make it the enemy of free markets. Those businessmen
sufficiently motivated to support the movement were insufficiently
sophisticated in the new mode of legal politics to effectively guide it, and
they lacked interest in the broader range of conservative legal opportunities.
Reorienting the relationship between conservative public interest law
and business would, therefore, be a necessary precondition for organizational
success.
CON SE RVAT IV E PUB L I C INT ER E S T L AW I 89

The problems with first-generation public interest law went beyond the
predominant role of business. The larger challenge was that change in
professionally dense areas like the law requires context-appropriate networks
to provide personnel that can develop legal ideas and strategy, identify
and bring cases, take maximal advantage of legal precedents in bureaucratic
rule-making, and raise money from foundation and
governmental sources. It was here that conservatives were weakest. Even
if the businessmen who supported the first-generation firms had been
more sophisticated than they were, they would have lacked the foot soldiers
to devise an alternative as effective as their liberal opponents. It
would take the development of a conservative legal network, of the sort
that the Federalist Society would create in the early 1980s, for conservatives
to have the public goods to support an effective legal movement.
Finally, the experience of the first generation of public interest law suggests
the importance of agenda control in the new American political system.
Liberal public interest law organizations were designed to control
the legal agenda and to use even marginal precedents to keep their adversaries
on the defensive. Conservatives fell into a trap by presenting the
“other side” in an institutional context—the courts—where power comes
from defining the terms of debate and choosing the terrain on which the
battles will be fought. By organizing reactively, conservatives guaranteed
that they could only slow down the advance of legal liberalism, but not
stop or reverse it. Only when they reoriented their activity to support
“counterrights” of their own could conservatives take advantage of the
opportunities of the new American political system.
Seizing those opportunities required new ideas and new organizations.
To gain control of the legal agenda, conservatives needed to escape the
bounds of judicial restraint, which stated what courts should not do
rather guiding where they could legitimately act. Judicial restraint was
the natural ideological match to the strategy of providing the “other
side,” since both aimed to resuscitate the legal status quo ante. Legitimating
an active role for the courts in defending individual rights would require
a much greater role for intellectuals in the conservative legal movement,
since transforming what judges considered reasonable and
appropriate was as important as the design of specific cases. Conservatives
would have to change the ideas of legal elites before they could effectively
change the behavior of courts.100 As subsequent chapters will show,
this is why conservatives of the second generation sought to rebuild their
legal movement around intellectuals and academics, and significantly diminish
the role played by businessmen and Republican politicians.

Law and Economics I: Out of the Wilderness

DOES THE FIELD OF LAW AND ECONOMICS even belong in a book on the
conservative legal movement? Many of the field’s most prestigious practitioners
are quite liberal and motivated primarily by a desire to make
law an empirical discipline, rather than an instrument of conservative or
libertarian ideology. That said, there can be no doubt that many conservatives,
especially foundation patrons, saw in law and economics a powerful
critique of state intervention in the economy, and a device for gaining a
foothold in the world of elite law schools.
To understand the place of law and economics in the larger conservative
legal movement, it is necessary to begin at the University of Chicago Law
School, the home of scholars such as Richard Posner and Richard Epstein
and the training ground of many of the movement’s most important early
practitioners and entrepreneurs. From there, our story moves on to the
myriad projects of Henry Manne, who scored the first real entrepreneurial
success for the movement through his economics programs for judges and
law professors, and his Liberty Fund conferences on law and economics.
Manne’s programs at Rochester, Miami, and Emory emerged at roughly
the same time as conservative public interest law, but were rooted in a
very different model of legal change. Businessmen dominated conservative
public interest law, but in law and economics they provided money
without taking a significant leadership role, a role that was tightly
guarded by the movement’s intellectuals. Whereas conservative public interest
law assumed that the way to counter legal liberals was by providing
the “other side” in court, the law and economics movement sought to
undermine the intellectual foundations on which its arguments, and its
claim to represent the public interest, were based.
Throughout this chapter, there are false starts and failed efforts at
institution building, to go along with some impressive organizational
successes. Even more interesting, this period shows that the conservative
movement was far from internally homogenous—internal conflict and
suspicion between movement patrons and entrepreneurs helped to sink
one of the movement’s most ambitious efforts at institution building,
Manne’s project of building “Hoover East” in the suburbs of Atlanta.
A close study of the early organizational history of law and economics
shows that conservative countermobilization was not governed by a
“grand plan” hatched all at once. Instead, movement patrons opportu-
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 91

nistically supported organizational entrepreneurs who seemed to have
found a crack in the edifice of legal liberalism. Only later did these opportunistic
decisions gel into a coherent strategy that could then be applied
in other cases.

Building the Mother Ship: The Creation of Law and Economics
at Chicago

The organizational history of law and economics, like so much of the
modern conservative movement, begins with the University of Chicago.
While it has since found other homes, Chicago has always been the spiritual
center of the movement, especially for those who see it as a critique
of government activism as well as a method for studying law. Chicago
provided a home for law and economics to develop even when its ideas
were regarded with intense skepticism and hostility in the larger academic
and legal world.1 As a result, the field was ready when the law schools
and policymakers became more open in the 1970s.
Law and economics began at Chicago by accident, rather than as part
of a larger ideological plan. The first economist in the University of Chicago
Law School was Henry Simons, who “published little and was not
a popular teacher”2 but “had a few good friends in the law school like
Wilber [Katz] and [Malcolm] Sharp” who managed to move Simons from
the economics department to the Law School in 1933.3 The irony of Simons’s
appointment was that what passed for law and economics in most
law schools at the time was part of the progressive project to question
the theoretical foundations of classical economics and the legal doctrines
informed by it.4 It would have been hard to find a character less sympathetic
to this approach than Simons, who was a representative of the “Old
Chicago” economics of Frank Knight and Jacob Viner. By the late 1930s
Simons had become, like many others of libertarian instincts, genuinely
spooked at what he saw as threats not just to the free market, but the free
society. Simons, who helped arrange for the publication in the United
States of The Road to Serfdom, agreed with Hayek that economic planning
posed a danger to personal and political liberty; in the words of
Aaron Director, he “thought that doomsday was upon us.”5 Simon’s
“doomsday” was set in motion by a growing state that pulled academics
into its maw, a trend that threatened both the quality of public policy and
the freedom of universities.

The prevailing drift toward increasing participation of professors as bureaucrats,
as governmental or business consultants, and as Round-Table exhibitionists
is, I think, tragically mistaken and wholly ominous for democracy....
It means not only bad government—democracy of cheap debate and mere
92 CHAPTER 4

technical maneuver, instead of government by intelligent, truth-seeking discussion—but
bad Universities as well. The alternation of professors between action
and inquiry, as occasional, temporary bureaucrats or part-time consultants, involves
accretions of power and prestige and often large additions to full-time
academic remuneration. . . . The consequent perversion and distortion of academic
standards and University functions thus becomes pervasive.6

The increasing reach of the state meant that universities no longer set their
own priorities, but became corrupted, albeit softly and subtly, by a state
that had outstripped its proper bounds.
While Simons was not appointed to the Law School because of his ideology,
he was a Chicago economist through and through, committed to
helping to save capitalism—if it could be saved. While his book on taxation
was considered a serious contribution at the time, he devoted a substantial
percentage of his time to less academic pursuits aimed at preserving
free enterprise.7 On the one hand, Simons published A Positive Plan
for Laissez-Faire, which by the standards of the time was highly marketoriented
but which is markedly lacking in orthodoxy by contemporary
standards.8 George Stigler quipped in this regard, “It’s true that he was
the man that said the Federal Trade Commission should be the most important
agency in government, a phrase that surely should be on no one’s
tombstone. . . . Yet, relative to the hectic, excited days of the thirties he
was leaning the other way.”9 Simons represented what is best understood
as the evangelical element of Chicago economics, embodying the same
spirit that inspired Milton Friedman in his public intellectual work and
the Chicago economics department’s famous (and in some quarters notorious)
collaboration with the Catholic University of Chile.10 By 1945, Simons’s
concern for the future of free societies had become acute, as had
his anxiety about the fortunes of classical liberal thought.

With the scattering of the “Austrians” and the vastly changed complexion of
economics at Cambridge and Harvard, this intellectual tradition . . . is now
almost unrepresented among the great universities, save for Chicago; and it may
not long be well represented at Chicago. It still has its firm adherents, to be
sure; but its competent representatives are widely dispersed and isolated from
one another, in academic departments or governmental bureaus where they are
largely denied opportunity for cooperation with like-minded scholars, or for
recruiting and training their successors.11

Acutely aware of their isolation, classical liberal thinkers initiated projects
aimed at identifying allies and networking domestically and internationally,
the most important of which was the Hayek-founded Mont Pelerin
Society. The overriding object of the Society was to cement a network of
classically liberal thinkers of all countries; “the contacts which the meetings
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 93

provide and the exchange of opinions between members which the mere
existence of a list provides should remain the main function of the
group.”12 Hayek’s proposal assumed that the “scattering” was a more or
less permanent state of affairs, and proposed to correct for it by networking
those advocates for classical liberalism that still remained.13
Simons’s plans at the University of Chicago were driven by a vision different
from Hayek’s libertarian internationale, looking instead to what we
might call “remnantism,” the idea that in a fallen world a “saving remnant”
of those still committed to right thinking should be preserved until
the folly of corrupt ideas was definitively revealed.14 Driven by this more
pessimistic sense of the prospects for classical liberalism, Simons proposed,
in a document sent to Hayek and intended for eventual consideration by
the Volker Fund,15 “There should, I submit, be at least one university in
the United States where this political-intellectual tradition is substantially
and competently represented—and represented not merely by individual
professors but also by a small group really functioning as a social-intellectual
group.”16 An institute, staffed by libertarian professors and with funding
for research support, visiting lecturers, seminars, and visiting fellows,
would bring together “the best economists and political philosophers of
its ‘school’ from all over the world.”17 With the concern about capture
by central administration that would later characterize the administrative
entrepreneurship of Henry Manne, Simons insisted that his institute
“should be set up, not as part of the University of Chicago but independently,
with its own governing body and its own funds. It should be located
at Chicago, however, only after reasonable assurances of close and friendly
relations with the University; and it should be free to move elsewhere if
effective or fruitful cooperation later proves unattainable.”18
For the future of law and economics at Chicago—and beyond—the
most important part of Simons’s proposal was its proposed leader:
“Aaron Director is not only the ideal person to head the Institute; he is
available and would be willing to undertake the task even at financial
sacrifice.”19 In a letter to Hayek, Simons confided that the project was
“contrived . . . largely for what one might call ulterior purposes . . . to
get Aaron Director back here and into a kind of work for which he has,
as you know, real enthusiasm and superlative talents.”20 While Simons’s
institute never materialized, the discussions surrounding it did succeed in
bringing Director to Chicago, through the beneficence of the Volker Fund.
Director recalls that

Hayek . . . met a person called Luhnow, who was then responsible for a lot of
money in the Volker Fund. He persuaded Luhnow to give a certain sum of
money to establish a center that would promote private enterprise. It was earlier
decided that Chicago was the only place that was likely to accept such a project,
94 CHAPTER 4

and it was also decided that the law school was the only part of the University
of Chicago that would accept such a project. Henry Simons was the one that
suggested to Hayek that I should be the person in charge of the project. Apparently
the dean of the law school, Wilber Katz, then wrote in one condition. It
was that I should be permitted to teach one course in the law school. The course,
of course, was economic analysis. Henry Simons had tired of teaching it by then
and had been trying to get the law school to get me to teach it. There I was with
this project, which never amounted to much, teaching this course on Economic
Analysis and Public Policy.21

Despite the failure of his institute, by obtaining a position for Director in
the Law School, Simons planted the seed for a quite unintended growth,
Chicago-style law and economics.
When Aaron Director came to the Chicago law school, the newly invigorated
field of antitrust was being taught by Edward Levi, an alumnus
of Thurman Arnold’s “brain trust” at the Justice Department. One of
Director’s duties at the Law School was coteaching the then-mandatory
antitrust course with Levi. In a story that became a Chicago legend, while
Levi taught the cases four days a week, Director would spend the fifth
day telling “us that everything that Levi had told us the preceding four
days was nonsense. He used economic analysis to show us that the legal
analysis would not stand up.”22 Robert Bork recalls that this course had
the effect of recruiting a significant number of students to discipleship in
the nascent movement: “A lot of us who took the antitrust course or the
economics course underwent what can only be called a religious conversion.
It changed our view of the entire world. . . . We became Janissaries
as a result of this experience.”23 Bork’s comment, while somewhat obscure,
is telling: the Janissaries were Christian prisoners of war who converted
to Islam and formed the elite corps of the Ottoman Empire. While
only a handful of Director’s students were as motivated as Bork, there
was something in the power of these ideas that impelled those who had
learned them to a life of evangelism—both intellectual and organizational—on
their behalf.24 A set of ideas that lacked the intrinsic potency
and breadth of Chicago-style price theory would have been unlikely to
produce such voluntary efforts on behalf of the cause.
Director’s influence reached beyond his own classroom, and in those
early days began to wind its way, through his impact on students and the
faculty, into the rest of the Law School as well. Henry Manne recalls that

at this very moment, a strange thing happened. . . . In classes we began talking
more about economics. Aaron Director began having a clear, direct influence
on certain members of the faculty. Every afternoon there was a tea well attended
by students and faculty. . . . Most of us stood around talking to Aaron
Director. A lot of the discussion of how you might talk about law and econom-
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 95

ics started at those teas. . . . It began showing up in classes. In my last semester,
I thought I was very lucky to have a seminar with the most famous law professor
in the country at that time, Karl Llewelyn, who gave a seminar in jurisprudence.
He thought he knew everything about everything. He thought the TVA
was one of the greatest things that ever happened. Well, those of us who knew
something about economics started raising some questions about it, and he
became apoplectic. He turned beet red, he slammed his book shut, stormed
out the door, and turned around and said, “Just wait until my first-year elements
class gets here, then we’ll have a real jurisprudence seminar!” That was
a revealing moment.25

Director’s influence was such that he continued to recruit converts for
law and economics, even after he retired from teaching. Posner, who met
Director at Stanford in 1968, recalls that “he was...a Socrates-like figure
in the sense that he wrote very little . . . [but had] a very penetrating
style of discussion. He wouldn’t let you get away with anything. Most of
what people say in conversation [is] casual nonsense, and he didn’t tolerate
any of that. He was polite but he was very firm and a real teacher.”
Director’s influence deepened with the creation of the Journal of Law
and Economics, and the establishment of a research program in antitrust.
The Anti-Trust Project was the first great entrepreneurial success for the
movement, allowing Director’s ideas, which would have been locked up
in his writer’s-blocked brain, to be disseminated to the larger world
through the project’s fellows.26 In addition to laying the intellectual foundations
for law and economics, it is also gave the field a solid organizational
base. “The economic analysis of law was no longer an idea but a
fact. The Journal of Law and Economics existed. There were law and
economics fellowships with the whole program financed by the Volker
Fund. Furthermore, and this was extremely important, there were now
law professors who took an active part in the program, at first Ken Dam
and Edmund Kitch, later to be joined by Richard Posner.”27 Law and
economics’ origins in antitrust are also an important explanation for the
movement’s success. Law and economics “was viewed as a very narrow
hole in the dam geared mainly to antitrust where it was perfectly appropriate.
At that time there was probably less resistance than might have
emerged later when the whole operation burst forth in ways that weren’t
forecast by the people involved.”28 Law and economics was able to find
a place in legal education because “this was an activity involving the appointment
of maybe one economist. It might be interesting. It did not
have clear implications for someone who was, say, teaching property.”29
The combination of an academic entrepreneur (Director), a group of disciples
(the Anti-Trust Project fellows), a willing patron (the Volker Fund),
96 CHAPTER 4

and a “hole” in the edifice of legal education (antitrust) prevented law
and economics from dying in the crib.
Ronald Coase would build an even more impressive base for law and
economics on Director’s foundation. It was the combination of the chance
to extend Director’s ideas and the opportunities available in Chicago that
led Coase to the Law School.

When I came to the University of Chicago, I regarded my role as that of Saint
Paul to Aaron Director’s Christ. He got the doctrine going, and what I had to
do was bring it to the gentiles. And I don’t think I would have ever come to the
University of Chicago had it not been for the existence of the Journal of Law
and Economics. That’s what I wanted to do. I wanted to get what Aaron started
going so that the whole profession [would be influenced by these ideas]—and
when I say profession, I mean the economics profession; I have no interest in
lawyers or legal education.30

Coase’s ideas showed how economic reasoning could apply to the entire
legal system, and his editorship of the JLE demonstrated these broad applications.
At the time, it was extremely difficult to place economically
informed articles in major law reviews,31 but Coase could run the JLE
proactively, soliciting articles that extended economic analysis of law to
social regulation, intellectual property, education, minimum wage policy,
unionization, property rights, broadcasting, and industry structure. In the
1960s, the JLE provided coordination and coherence to the movement
that would have been absent if its adherents had to publish in pure economics
or law journals. Coase’s work with the JLE also meant that, when
an intellectual entrepreneur par excellence arrived in Chicago, he could
draw on a deep foundation of preexisting scholarship.

The Externalities of Richard Posner and the Takeoff of
Law and Economics

While the work of Director and Coase helped to establish law and economics
as a respectable field, it was the emergence of Richard Posner that
made it an academic phenomenon of the first rank.32 First and foremost,
the breadth of the ambition of Posner’s major work, Economic Analysis
of Law, signaled to the legal academy that law and economics could identify
major defects in traditional approaches across the entirety of legal
scholarship, thereby inducing others, especially prospective law professors,
to follow his lead. Second, Posner legitimated law and economics as
a mainstream field by setting off so many arguments with legal academia’s
incumbent scholars. Third, because he was publishing in so many different
fields, Posner created a strong incentive for even the unsympathetic
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 97

to become competent in law and economics, if only to argue with or understand
what he was saying. Fourth, Posner helped to create a small
industry by cofounding the economic consulting firm Lexecon, thereby
creating a demand for persons trained in law and economics, as well as
educating lawyers in the usefulness of the field. Posner’s work, in short,
produced a positive externality for the movement, by increasing the demand
for its scholarship and removing blockages to its supply.
After graduating from Harvard Law and clerking for Supreme Court
Justice William Brennan, Posner went on to a series of important posts in
the federal government, concluding at the Solicitor General’s office, where
he handled antitrust matters. Up to that point, Posner’s career trajectory
pointed to a bright, if conventional, future in the liberal academic establishment.
At the Solicitor General’s office, Posner began to be exposed to
the possibilities of law and economics, when as the head of a Telecommunications
Task Force he worked with the economists Leland Johnson and
William Baumol, and the law and economics pioneer William Baxter. As
a consequence, he says, “By the time I went on the teaching market and
I was hired by Stanford I knew I wanted to do economic analysis of law.”
What was not clear to Posner was what a career in economic analysis
of law looked like. Reflecting on his arrival at Stanford in 1986, Posner
recalls,

I noticed the name Aaron Director on the door of an office, and I knew the
name because I read a little book that . . . mentioned [him] . . . disapprovingly,
but indicating that he had an interesting point of view. I thought that since I
was going to do antitrust I would meet this fellow so I went and introduced
myself, and soon realized that this is a very smart person. I mean, Lee Johnson
was a good economist, but Aaron was a really exceptional person.

In addition to influencing him intellectually, Director also brought Posner
into contact with his Chicago network. After Nixon was elected president
in the fall of 1968, George Stigler was asked to set up a task force on
antitrust, to which he appointed Coase and Dam of Chicago, and, on
Director’s recommendation, Posner. Posner’s connection to the network
deepened even further when Stigler taught at Stanford that same fall. Bill
Baxter was also teaching law at Stanford, and introduced him to the work
of Guido Calabresi, which “was a real eye-opener, this idea that you could
use economics to talk about tort law.”33 This was also the year that Gary
Becker published his famous article on the economics of crime.34 Taken
together, these simultaneous influences suggested to Posner that if economics
could be applied beyond antitrust, to torts and criminal law, then
there was no area of law immune from its scrutiny. While his year at
Stanford opened his eyes to the potential of law and economics, its equally
98 CHAPTER 4

durable impact was to pull him into the network that would land him an
appointment at Chicago in the fall of 1969.
Becoming the Richard Posner who would go on to apply economic
calculation to all areas of social life involved more than a new methodology.
Given his background as a Brennan clerk and Johnson administration
lawyer, he embraced a new ideology as well.

I would say I was looking for an academic niche, but it is of course the case
that people like George and Aaron and Milton, Gary Becker, Harold Demsetz,
they’re extremely conservative. . . . I’d been very liberal up until then, but I
didn’t like the student unrest of the late sixties and the general leftism. . . . I
didn’t have any particular belief in the Vietnamese, all this left-wing stuff and
riots and all that, so I was unsympathetic, but as late as ’68 I did vote for
Humphrey. I didn’t vote for Nixon, but gradually I swung around [so that] in
the seventies I was very conservative, and so certainly part of my interest in
economics analysis of law . . . by the seventies was an effort to reform the law
and make antitrust more economic and less political, which would narrow it
necessarily. . . . So I think the conservative and the normative side of it was a
factor, but I think the most important was just that these people seemed very
smart, analytically. This is different from . . . their political views . . . this reflex
hostility [to government]. It was a reaction of course to overregulation. . . .
They seemed smarter than lawyers . . . and in particular they were smarter in
the sense they had much better sharper analytical tools for dealing with law
rather then the standard legal vocabulary, so that was really the decisive thing,
and that was more important than the normative [side].

Looking back at Posner’s epochal Economic Analysis of Law, it is hard
to miss this weaving together of the ideological and methodological sides
of law and economics. Posner’s tone was brutal, implying that traditional
approaches to law were based on little more than muddle-headed liberal
benevolence. Economic liberalism had become a sedative to serious discussion
of first principles, and the legal profession and the law itself
needed to be administered a dose of shock therapy to awaken itself.35 The
conservatives that Posner began to associate himself with seemed willing
to confront reality directly, and they had a methodology that allowed
them to do so.
Economic Analysis of Law helped to move law and economics from its
relatively low profile in the 1960s to its ubiquity in the 1970s and 1980s.
While leading liberal legal scholars largely ignored the previous generation
of law and economics scholarship, they felt compelled to respond to
Posner. George Priest observes that, despite its weaknesses,

Posner’s efficiency-of-the-law project . . . had great intellectual influence—defined
even in market terms—because it electrified the academy by compelling
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 99

them to learn something about law and economics. Here, Calabresi had an
important role as well. Calabresi and Posner both had substantial influence over
the market for law and economics through their decade-long debate over the
importance of efficiency as a value. Note, however, that this influence derives
not so much from the originality of any idea or from its attempted refutation,
but from the debate itself. It was the debate between the Chicagoan and the
Yalie, the conservative and the ultraliberal, which had the influence. . . . Both
parties embraced the core of economic analysis as a mechanism for thinking
about legal problems; they simply differed in that embrace in many respects. At
heart, what was important in the Posner-Calabresi debate was the economic
analysis that they agreed upon. Observers could side with one or the other combatant
regarding their differences. To do so convincingly, however, each observer
had to learn the common areas of agreement.36

The Posner-Calabresi debate convinced legal scholars that, if they did not
update their analytical toolkit, they might be left behind. Michael Graetz
of Yale Law School recalls that Posner played a critical role in the diffusion
of law and economics “because he was saying, ‘You may think you
can ignore it in procedure, but you can’t ignore it in procedure. You may
think that family law doesn’t apply here, but you can’t ignore it there. In
criminal law you can’t ignore it.’ By the mid-1970s young scholars at least
thought it was something that you had to read and understand.” Finally,
the fact that one of the participants in the debate was at Yale Law School
helped to strip law and economics of the perception that it was an entirely
conservative, University of Chicago project. “In the academic world generally,
certainly in the law school part of it, anything out of Chicago economics
at that time was ideological. It wasn’t really scholarship. But here
was someone who never set foot in Chicago at that time writing the same
kind of thing. . . . Well that gave a kind of respectability [to the field].”37
Economic Analysis of Law signaled that traditional legal approaches
were vulnerable and that substantial reputations could be made in challenging
them. As Roberta Romano has convincingly argued, the legal
academy’s approach to corporate law, for example, was intellectually vulnerable
in the late 1960s, but the efforts of Henry Manne and Ralph
Winter to apply economic concepts to the field were ignored at best and
ridiculed at worst.38 Because of his sheer visibility, Posner could not be
ignored. Douglas Baird, a student at Stanford Law in the mid-1970s and
later dean of the University of Chicago Law School, recalls that Posner
reshaped the structure of legal scholarship.

In the early seventies, people like Posner would come in and spend six weeks
studying family law, and they’d write a couple of articles explaining why everything
everyone was saying in family law was 100 percent wrong. And then the
replies would be, “No, we were only 80 percent wrong.” And Posner never got
100 CHAPTER 4

things exactly right, but he always turned everything upside down, and people
talked about law differently. . . . By the time I came along, and I wasn’t trained
as economist, it was clear that . . . doing great work was easy. . . . I used to say
that this was just like knocking over Coke bottles with a baseball bat. You had
the article du jour club. You could just go in and write something revolutionary
and go in tomorrow and write another article. I remember writing articles
where the time between getting the idea and getting it accepted from a major
law review was four days. I’m not Richard Posner, and few of us are. I got out
of law school, and I was interested in bankruptcy law, which was inhabited by
intellectual midgets. . . . It was a complete intellectual wasteland. I got tenure
by saying, “Jeez, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.” You
got tenure for that! The reality is that there was just an open field begging for
people to do great work.

Economic Analysis of Law suggested to young scholars that the future
belonged to law and economics, and that traditional doctrinal scholarship
was no longer the unquestioned route to success in the legal academy.
On top of this, expectations for scholarly production among law professors
began to increase considerably in the 1970s, and Posner’s remarkable
productivity showed that law and economics was an approach that
fit these increasingly strict tenure standards. No group was more effected
by this than the editors of elite law reviews. “If you were a student who
was interested in going into law teaching, in the mid- to late 1970s your
education would include editing law review articles of Posner and Easterbrook.
. . . If you look at the articles that were published in the field in
this period, people like Posner were just crushing people and leading the
pack. That’s the cutting edge that people like me were exposed to.”39
Finally, Posner influenced the legal academic pipeline because, in comparison
to the first generation of law and economics scholars, he had sterling
establishment credentials, and his success destabilized the model of what
constituted the career of an elite legal scholar. Posner recalls, “I was someone
who had very conventional legal credentials. . . . I was a great student,
I clerked for the Supreme Court, I worked for the Solicitor General, so I
was a sort of model law professor type, but instead of writing conventional
law professor stuff I was writing economics, so if I was doing that
. . . then people began to wonder what exactly is the standard law professor’s
career?” Posner’s example suggested that there was no risk, and
potentially great reward, in a career in law and economics.
Posner was also instrumental in exploiting the business potential of law
and economics, by cofounding (with Richard Landes and their student
Andrew Rosenfield) the economic consulting firm Lexecon in 1977.40 The
firm, which now has a staff of over one hundred, offices in five cities, and
clients that include many of the nation’s major corporations and top law
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 101

firms, provides expert witnesses and economic analysis on litigation and
regulatory matters. The increasing comfort of judges with economic analysis,
in large part a function of the surging legitimacy of law and economics
scholarship, has made economic consultants almost mandatory for
large companies involved in complex litigation. Michael Mandel has identified
three forces leading to increasing demand for economic consulting:
the boom in litigation, economic deregulation, and mergers and acquisitions.
Romano adds to Mandel’s list the increase in complex financial
deals beginning in the 1980s, which stimulated market demand for law
and economics practitioners and provided natural experiments with
which to test its claims.41 Writing as the economic stakes involved with
the law were increasing, Mandel argues that “lawyers and judges have
become much more comfortable with economic reasoning,” a phenomenon
he attributes to the spread of law and economics in law schools, and
the Law and Economics Center’s seminars for federal judges (for the LEC
see below).42 Given the stakes involved, firms have been willing to spend
enormous amounts for economic expert witnesses: Mandel provided a
low estimate of the market in 1997 (just at the largest firms) of $300
million, “almost certainly larger than the payroll for the full-time faculty
at the top 25 economics departments.”43 In 1994, consulting fees for top
economists at Lexecon were $300 an hour, and some estimates suggest
they have doubled in the years since then.44 The lucrative nature of the
field created a substantial demand for both lawyers and economists
trained in the area, putting pressure on law schools to produce students
familiar with the subject.
Posner influenced the legal scholarship market on the supply (of scholarship)
and demand (by law schools and firms) sides, and in the process
helped lead law and economics from the margins to the academic mainstream.
It would take skillful organizational entrepreneurship, however,
to make the most of the opening that Posner and others had created.

The Birth of an Intellectual Entrepreneur: Manne at Rochester

While Coase claims the mantle of the St. Paul of law and economics,
Henry Manne, along with Posner, has an equally strong claim to having
evangelized the gentiles.45 As the movement’s first organizational entrepreneur,
Manne increased the audience for law and economics scholarship
in the academy and on the bench. While there were larger forces
encouraging law and economics, Manne’s activities are essential in explaining
the rapidity and depth of its diffusion in the 1970s and 1980s.
Manne made his reputation as a legal scholar at George Washington
University, producing work on corporate law that was (and continues to
102 CHAPTER 4

be) controversial. In the mid-1960s, Manne argued that hostile takeovers
are the most effective device for the control of management46 and that
insider trading is an efficient mechanism for extracting information from
inside the firm.47 On the basis of these publications, Manne was offered
an endowed chair in the University of Rochester’s political science department,
then under the leadership of the legendary William Riker, who had
made it the “mother ship” of rational choice theory, the application of
microeconomic theory to political institutions and processes.48 In addition
to being a member of the political science department, Manne was asked
by then-president W. Allen Wallis to take over the planning of a new, fully
interdisciplinary law school with a strong emphasis on law and economics.
The planning documents Manne generated show the two sides of law
and economics, its nonideological critique of legal education and legal
scholarship and an ideologically charged attack on government interference
in the economy. While the law school was never built, its failure led
Manne to direct his entrepreneurial energies into wholesale reform of the
legal academy, and his plans for Rochester provided the template for his
deanship of the George Mason University Law School fifteen years later.
Manne’s formal proposal for the law school emphasized the nonideological
component of law and economics. He noted that criticism of the
standard law school curriculum was not of recent vintage, but could be
traced back to the rise of legal realism, which led naturally to interdisciplinarity;
as there was no uniquely “legal” discipline, the law was best
approached through the methods of the social sciences. This intellectual
critique, Manne argued, had now become a professional necessity. The
specialization of law and the complexity, differentiation, and regulation
of the economy made law schools’ focus on appellate advocacy skills unsuited
to the world of working lawyers.49 While this was a compelling
critique, it had not yet influenced the core of legal education.

In spite of the consistent responsible criticism of both the form and the substance
of modern American legal education, the traditional mode continues to
prevail. . . . This process produces a graduate with a somewhat mechanical approach
to legal problems and little comprehension of the social, political and
economic realities of his subject matter. The modern American political system
has placed responsibilities on lawyers for which this traditional program has
not adequately equipped them.50

No one would create new law schools that resembled the current model,
but it was impossible to unwind existing institutions and substitute
something new in their place. “Introducing a program of this sort with
a completely new law school is quite different from attempting to introduce
such a program into an existing law school . . . it is almost impossible
to change the institutionalized patterns of a traditionally-oriented
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 103

law school. . . . This would not be the case with a program adopted
from the beginning with a faculty who were sympathetic to it.”51 While
newness in a highly reputation-sensitive field like education could be a
liability, Manne proposed to make it his chief asset. “There is no vested
bureaucracy, no tradition-bound alumni, and no contented administrators
without strong motivation for change. It is, happily, relatively simple
to institute vastly improved educational programs in a new law
school, whereas it might be impossible to get leadership on such matters
from existing schools.”52
The core of Manne’s alternative was law and economics. In Manne’s
view, while other disciplines had become attractive to law professors,

no other social science discipline can begin to match the relevance and importance
of economics for the training of modern lawyers. . . . The idea should be
to infuse the entire curriculum with economic sophistication. Law graduates
who plan on careers in government, in business or with business law firms
should be equipped to analyze the problems they confront with rigorous analytic
techniques of both law and economics. If this training can be successfully
accomplished, it would be safe to predict a heavy demand for these graduates.53

The attractiveness of the law school to future graduates was only a part
of the story, however. Equally important was the potential that the approach
had for attracting the support of American business.

On very few occasions have law schools sought direct support from industry.
The law school at the University of Chicago has done successful fund raising
from corporations, as has Yale. . . . But these two, and undoubtedly other
cases not know to the writer, are the exceptions rather than the rule. Almost
every corporation today has considerable in-house legal work; the general
counsel has become an increasingly important figure; and the promotion of
general counsels into higher executive offices is quite common in American
industry. Thus a law school especially designed to serve the needs with which
these men are familiar could strike a responsive chord that many other law
schools do not.54

By taking advantage of this untapped resource and leveraging the resources
of Rochester’s well-developed business school and economics department,
Manne proposed to create a new law school that could compete
with the elites of legal education. “If the University of Rochester established
a law school along the lines proposed here, it should be possible in
a few years to achieve an academic status which would otherwise take
many years and considerably more money.”55
Building such a school would require a great deal of money, and not
just clever ideas. Manne’s plan assumed the attractiveness of the school’s
law and economics focus to American business. It was here that the other
104 CHAPTER 4

side of Manne’s project, and law and economics itself, revealed itself most
clearly. Especially instructive in this regard was Manne’s correspondence
with Pierre Goodrich, the wealthy Indianapolis founder of the Liberty
Fund. The two men’s shared assessment of the state of American education,
and legal education in particular, is vividly expressed by Manne’s
observation that

the Augean stables were cleansed by diverting a stream of water through them.
. . . The educational world is such a mess today from the libertarian point of
view that a cleansing is certainly long overdue, but one strong stream of attractive
conservative philosophy might just be able to sweep things clean. One law
school dedicated to propositions like those you propound . . . would do more
to discipline all the other law schools (and conceivably other segments of the
university) than anything I can think of.56

Manne clearly saw himself, as Simons did, as part of a true-believing remnant,
comparing the potential for his law school to that of the Chicago
economics department.

I frequently recall my own experience at the University of Chicago from 1949
to 1952. I received my first serious introduction to libertarian views there. The
man most responsible for my education in libertarian values was Aaron Director,
the economist in the Law School. But consider the state of economics education
in the United States at that time. With the exception of perhaps six to eight
people at the University of Chicago and four or five more scattered around the
country, there was literally no remnant of libertarian philosophy in academic
economics in America. Had that Chicago group not existed, I think that today’s
growing popularity and respect for so-called “Chicago economics” would not
exist. That is not to say that libertarian values would have disappeared from
the face of the earth, or that Chicago economics perfectly embodies those values.
But it is to suggest that from a small tough nut, like that group at Chicago,
vastly larger and more important things can grow. Actually I believe that the
law school world is even more ripe for this than economics was twenty years
ago. A single generation of lawyers from one school dedicated to true liberal
values could turn the American legal system back into a productive and desirable
channel. At least it would be a start, and that is more than is happening
elsewhere at present.57

This letter makes clear what Manne’s proposal did not, that the Rochester
Law School would provide a home for those who believed in “true liberal
values,” and, like Chicago, would send out missionaries to the unchurched.
It would do what Yale Law School had done for modern liberalism:
provide an intense environment for the development of ideas, and a
training ground for the lawyers who would disseminate them. “Hopefully
all our students will become educated in the true implications of law for
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 105

free men in a free society. If we do succeed in that goal, we shall certainly
be the only major law school in the United States even addressing itself
to the problems of law in the free society.”58 Manne was clear that if this
project was not undertaken at Rochester, it was exceptionally unlikely
that it could be put into place anywhere else, as Rochester was “one of the
few major universities in the United States that has a significant number of
professors who are strongly oriented toward the free market philosophy
and the free society.”59
A sympathetic faculty only dealt with the internal problem. More
daunting was attracting external support for a law school with a distinctly
libertarian edge.

We have a tremendous fund raising problem ahead of us, since so many foundations
and individuals will not support what they consider a “conservative” law
school, and I will not dishonestly propose something to them while I plan to
establish something else. I have no interest in founding “just another law
school,” and certainly no interest in furthering the statist characteristics of our
leading schools. . . . Nothing would make me more proud than to be able to
name our law school the Pierre F. Goodrich School of Freedom Under Law.60

The traditional reliance on alumni makes raising money for a new law
school a risky proposition, but Manne believed that law and economics
would allow Rochester to raise money from conservative donors, like
Goodrich and the (then still conservative) Pew Foundation. Raising that
kind of money was a full-time, presidential-level job, but despite Allen
Wallis’s strong commitment to the project—he donated half a million dollars
to the project—his time was increasingly absorbed in conflict with
the university’s faculty.61 While fund-raising problems and the opposition
of the local bar62 killed Manne’s plans at Rochester, his failure redirected
his entrepreneurial activities to the larger world of legal academia. Henceforth,
he would operate within existing law schools while mounting an
ideological and pedagogical critique of them.
Manne’s greatest entrepreneurial success at Rochester were his Economics
Institutes for Law Professors. The seminars brought law professors
together for three and one-half weeks (later reduced to two) of intensive
training in microeconomics: “No effort was made in the early
versions of this course to relate economics directly to the law: that was to
be left entirely to the law professors, each armed with a copy of Posner’s
Economic Analysis of Law.”63 Manne’s motivations for starting the program
were complex. On the one hand, the ideas themselves were so powerful
that they produced a powerful motivation for spreading them to
others: “I was all excited by the power of the economics that I had
learned. It was totally new. It wasn’t the economics I learned in college,
it wasn’t even the economics I had learned from Aaron Director. This was
106 CHAPTER 4

. . . the economics of property rights. . . . I thought that if law professors
learned this, it would really change things.” Manne’s alienation in the
legal academy meant that he also had more self-interested motivations for
spreading these ideas to law professors. Having failed to receive an offer
from an elite law school and unable to start his own, Manne focused on
making himself part of the mainstream by exercising influence from the
outside: “Over time I educated over 650 law professors, and I dare say I
became friendly with a great number of them. So slowly, this idea that
Henry Manne was some kind of a kook—and it was strong—[declined].
. . . This was wholesaling it. I thought that then, and I used it to sell it
[that way] too.” Unable to supply legal education himself (retailing), he
could supply the suppliers, law professors themselves (wholesaling). In
the process, Manne gradually evolved into a network entrepreneur, focusing
on the dissemination of ideas and the creation of a coherent community
of law and economics scholars.
The seminars worked on both the supply and demand sides of law and
economics. On the supply side, the seminars provided law professors with
the skills to introduce economic concepts into their scholarship. As a later
section will make clear (see “Early Adopters: UVA and USC”), the Manne
programs substantially helped certain law schools, such as the University
of Virginia, develop a core of law and economics scholars. The scholarship
of Ralph Winter, then a professor of law at Yale and later a judge on
the Second Circuit, and Douglas Ginsburg, then a professor of law at
Harvard and now chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, took on a strong law
and economics coloration soon after they attended Manne’s seminars.64
Warren Schwartz of UVA Law attended the first Manne seminar and recalls,
“As an intellectual matter, I had a very serious itch that I did not
have the theoretical foundation for. . . . In particular, I was teaching regulated
industries from the typical casebook which simply disclosed what
the regulatory law was. It simply didn’t make any sense to me. I was very
much in the market if you will for some theoretical coherence. I went to
the [first seminar] at Rochester, and it was for me a just a very exciting
awakening.” Perhaps the most direct impact was at the University of Toronto.
Manne recalls, “I got a call from... Michael Trebilcock. He was
from New Zealand, and had been teaching at University of Toronto Law
School, and the province of Ontario just put up a quarter of a million
dollars for a program in law and economics, and he’d been selected to
head it. He said, ‘But I’ve never studied economics. Could I come to your
program?’ He did, and went on to head what was one of the strongest
law and economics programs in the world.”
Just as important were the effects on the demand side. At the simplest
level, the seminars helped law professors understand economics and integrate
it into their teaching, even if they did not produce it themselves. In
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 107

addition, the tenured professors who made the law school hiring decisions
were wholly untutored in economics, and because of ideology or incomprehension
were resistant to hiring law and economics scholars. Eroding
this blockage in the academic hiring market was a key objective of the
seminars for law professors. In order to have maximum impact, Manne
“would not take a single professor from any law school. They had to
come in a minimum of pairs, and the more the merrier, because I knew
exactly what would happen, they would go back and get laughed at, as I
had been at GW. . . . If there were two or more, they could support each
other. In the first program there were six from UVA, four from Yale, two
from Harvard, Indiana had three or four.” Steve Eagle, who was one of
Manne’s earliest hires at the George Mason Law School, also believes that
the seminars had this effect, saying, “Even those who went to the program
and went back to their home schools, and did pretty much what they had
done before, had an exposure to law and economics, and it made it easier
for them to accept hiring people in the law and economics field, made
them more comfortable and conversant in law and economics scholarship.
. . . It spread the idea that law and economics was an important part
of the law professors’ world, even if the individual didn’t participate.”
Michael Graetz, then at UVA Law and one of the program’s earliest graduates,
recalls,

I remember even now a handful of people from around the country who you
met who became important people in their fields. I think they created lots of
networks, lots of people stayed in touch. . . . It created a group of true believers.
. . . If you look at key first-generation people of a certain age cohort of that
time, you’d find that they had been through the Manne school at some point,
because he did it for a long time. . . . It made them more sophisticated consumers.
. . . It created lots of networks. . . . Henry certainly reduced the transaction
costs to people becoming competent at least as readers if not as producers. And
he got enough people interested to be producers. So he played a catalyst role.

The Economics Institute for Law Professors spurred the creation of more
scholarship, increased the audience that was receptive to it, and reduced
the hostility to its practitioners. By demonstrating organizational success,
Manne’s first program also made it much easier for Manne to raise money
for later, even more ambitious programs.
What gave the program for law professors even greater momentum was
the ease with which Manne was able to raise funds, a pleasant surprise
after his experience at Rochester. Manne had tried and failed to launch a
similar program at GWU, but between 1968 (when Manne left GWU)
and the early 1970s business had become much more open to supporting
law and economics.
108 CHAPTER 4

This time when I went for fund-raising, I wanted $100,000, and I thought I
could handle a fund-raising job of raising $10,000 from ten of them [major
corporations]. I wrote to eleven, and I related it heavily to antitrust. At this
point, the world knew that Chicago economics was the only thing that could
possibly save them from an antitrust debacle, and I related it strongly to that.
I said it was a way to get these ideas across to a large number of law professors
who create the lawyers and government officials. Well, of the eleven I wrote to,
within a few weeks I had $10,000 from ten of them, and the last $10,000 came
in a few weeks later. It was the U.S. Steel company. I called the guy and said, “I
can’t use your money,” and he said, “No, don’t do that.” I gave the extra to
the university.

Manne was riding the same wave as conservative public interest law’s
early entrepreneurs, but, in sharp contrast, Manne was raising money
from corporations for long-range, free-market-oriented activity. This
fund-raising success would be even more important in subsequent years,
as Manne’s programmatic ambitions increased.

Spreading the Gospel: The Creation of the Law and Economics Center

By 1973, Manne had definitively concluded that he could be “far more
effective in some activity other than waiting around here indefinitely to
open and administer a law school.”65 Manne’s opportunity for greater
effectiveness arose at the relatively undistinguished law school of the University
of Miami, under the deanship of former University of Chicago law
professor Soia Mentschikoff. The new dean was eager to put the school
on the map, and despite her ideological reservations about Manne’s intellectual
approach, she agreed to give him “the necessary autonomy to run
a free-market oriented research, teaching and conference center,” which
would “do scholarly research in free market alternatives to the regulatory
approach so pervasive in our legal system today.”66 Manne’s experience
at Miami shows the opportunities and constraints that existed for conservatives
in the legal academy of the 1970s and early 1980s.
While Manne had been considered a marginal, even eccentric, character
in the legal academy of the 1960s, by the mid-1970s his star was rising.
Manne credits the shift to the increasing credibility of free-market economics:
“I had become respectable at this point. . . . You know who I
credited for that? Milton Friedman. At an AALS meeting in about 1969
or 70, two young professors that I didn’t even know were walking ahead
of me, and they were talking about me. And I heard one of them say, he’s
not a conservative kook, he’s like Milton Friedman! Milton made the
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 109

world safe for people to talk about free market [ideas]. . . . Now I was
respectable—she [Soia Mentschikoff] wouldn’t have touched me two
years before—and it wasn’t accidental that she called me the same year
that Yale did.” The rising tide of Chicago was raising all boats, Manne’s
included, by removing the stigma associated with libertarian ideas. In his
last year at Rochester, the offer from Yale Law School that Manne had
waited so long for finally came through.

At that point, I finally had an offer from Yale. I got a call from Ralph Winter.
He said . . . we want you to come visit as a prelude to a faculty appointment.
. . . I said Ralph, you’re two weeks and five years too late. . . . Two weeks ago
I agreed with Soia Mentschikoff that I was going to start this new center at
Miami . . . [and] you’re five years too late for me to give a damn. That was one
of the truest things I’ve ever said. Because for the first fifteen years I was dying
to get to Columbia or Yale Law School.

Why did Manne turn down a visiting appointment at Yale, then as now
the pinnacle of legal education? Resentment at the elite legal institutions
that had refused to make room for him played an important part, but
Miami’s relative backwardness offered opportunities that even a law
school as strong as Yale could not match.

The relative weakness of the University academically is paradoxically an advantage
in that same regard. At a stronger University or law school, where I would
not be the most prominent professor, it is very unlikely that I could promote a
program of this sort without considerable resistance and interference from
other members of the law faculty, the economics department, and from the
University administration. It is unlikely that an opportunity like this one would
ever be presented at any other major university in the United States.67

Miami, unlike Yale, was not in a position in the legal academic market
to allow its ideological scruples to interfere with an opportunity for
national attention.
The Law and Economics Center (LEC) that Manne created at Miami
was remarkably ambitious. In addition to the economics program for law
professors, the LEC hosted an economics program for federal judges, a
fellowship program for students with economics training to obtain a law
degree, and topical conferences supported by the Liberty Fund. These
programs transformed law and economics from an idea to a movement
with real organizational breadth.
The Olin Fellows program brought recent PhD’s in economics to
Miami to receive a fully funded law degree, supplemented with a specialized
curriculum in law and economics. The objective was to produce economists
that law schools could hire, at a time when JD/PhD’s were very
110 CHAPTER 4

rare in legal academia. The alumni of the Olin program remember the
Law and Economics Center as a heady intellectual environment. Fred
McChesney, professor of law at Northwestern University and certainly
the most distinguished alumnus of the Olin Fellows, recalls, “It was fabulous.
People coming in, going out, giving short courses, giving long
courses, giving papers, conferences, it was electric, just electric. . . . Buchanan
came in, Coase came in. . . . Guido [Calabresi] came in. . . . You’d
be walking down the hall, and there’d be Gary Becker, there’d be Armen
Alchian, there’d be Harold Demsetz. . . . You want to talk to them? Go
in and talk to them. Anybody who was somebody was down there at
some point.” None of the other LEC Olin Fellows ascended as far as
McChesney, but the program had other successes, the most important of
which was producing the core of the faculty that Manne recruited in his
first few years as dean of GMU Law School. In Manne’s view, the success
of the program has to be judged relative to its location at Miami and later
at Emory.

I always thought that the Olin Fellowship program was central to the whole

idea of the Law and Economics Center. . . . Indeed, I think I might go so far as

to say that I do not think the Center could ever have had the success it did
without the galvanizing and energizing influence of the Fellows. . . . I was confident
that the uniqueness of the program and the growing reputation of the
Center, as well as a lot of money in a fairly bad market, would get us decent
students. It worked; the Olin Fellows were regularly in the top 10 percent of
their law school classes. . . . After all the dust settled, sixteen of the thirty-three
Fellows at Miami and Emory ended up in academia, some in business schools
but mostly in law. One [Fred McChesney] is today a very distinguished chair
professor at Northwestern; one is a mainstay of law and economics at George
Mason. . . . One had a chair at Kansas Law School before he took (and then
dropped) the deanship at Chapman’s business school (he now runs a very successful
program in economics for state judges for the Brookings-AEI Joint Center);
one was a very prolific and successful economist at Clemson until he died
a few years ago; one was my associate dean and a very successful professor at
GMUSL. . . . One (who finished his law degree at Chicago) is a professor at U
Penn Law School; and one became the academic VP at the University of Texas—
Arlington after a successful teaching career. . . . Consider, if you will, the rather
amazing list that I just presented. These were law graduates of Miami and
Emory law schools (though to be sure some had very prestigious PhD degrees),
and I suspect that this is more academics than those two schools have produced
in total during their entire existence.

Stated in these terms, there is no question that the Olin Fellows program
was a success. Soon enough, however, conservative movement patrons,
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 111

the Olin Foundation especially, asked themselves whether success relative
to weak institutions was enough.
More unambiguously successful were the Liberty Fund conferences and
the economics programs for federal judges. The Liberty Fund conferences,
which ran from 1975 to 1985, brought law and economics practitioners
and others together for intense conferences on a single subject. As a letter
from Manne to the Earhart Foundation explained, part of the motivation
for the conferences was LEC public relations: “The great advantage to us
of these programs is that they rapidly acquaint both the economics and
law school worlds with our existence, and they generate an excellent book
of papers and proceedings with the Center’s imprimatur.”68 More important
were the networks the conferences created between scholars in
economics and law who rarely ran in the same professional circles. The
Liberty Fund conferences were of critical importance to younger scholars,
integrating them into the budding law and economics network. George
Priest, now at Yale but then at the University of Puget Sound Law School,
recalls that the conferences

gave younger people an opportunity to interact with senior people, and it created
a cadre of law and economics types that proved to be very helpful. I met
Bob Bork at the “Fire of Truth” Conference,69 and spent a lot of time with him
there; Ed Kitch took me to a conference once when I was a research fellow [at
Chicago] and I met people from UCLA, USC, and other schools. And after I
did very well in some of these conferences, Henry Manne started soliciting articles
from me for the conferences. That gives you even more prominence, and
encourages you to work harder. Getting a thousand-dollar honorarium to write
a paper then was a lot. I drooled over it. It was very helpful.

Attendance at the Liberty Fund conferences also increased the perceived
market value of law and economics practitioners, increasing their status
in their own institutions and the likelihood that they would be recruited
by other, more prestigious institutions.

These conferences both enhanced existing markets and created markets of their
own. Within a law school, again because of the rarity of academic conferences,
it was a distinction to be invited to an academic conference of this nature; to
be asked to deliver a paper was a special distinction. Thus, attendance at one
or more of Henry Manne’s conferences greatly enhanced the positions of law
and economics scholars within existing schools and with other schools to which
they might be recruited. . . . They created markets that vastly enhanced the
position of many of us in the field (including myself).70

Charles Goetz, who became a major figure in law and economics at Virginia,
is especially impressed with the networking functions of the Liberty
Fund conferences.
112 CHAPTER 4

They were very important to me, because I very quickly got to know the other
people who were interested in this stuff spread out across the United States of
America. I met the people who were players at that time, and who you might
want to have exchanged a paper [with] and so forth. I met people whose stuff I
then knew enough to read. One example that strikes close to home is that I met
George Priest at those conferences. He was a young guy out in Siberia, at the
University of Puget Sound. I remember being very excited by George, and recommending
him to the appointments committee at the University of Virginia.71

The Liberty Fund programs were also important for purely intellectual
reasons. They provided detailed feedback to scholars working in law and
economics, identified areas for new research in a field still in its infancy,
and provided opportunities for ideas to germinate. In the absence of a
geographic center other than Chicago, the Liberty Fund programs provided
otherwise isolated scholars with the intense, face-to-face interactions
necessary for intellectual ferment and creativity.72
Manne’s most famous programmatic achievement was, without a
doubt, his Economics Institute for Federal Judges. Started in 1976, soon
after Manne arrived in Miami, these were a direct spin-off of the institutes
for law professors, which Manne concluded were successful and worthy
of extension to other audiences (before the first seminar for law professors,
in fact, he conducted programs for congressional staff and was considering
programs for law review editors, journalists, and even clergy).73
The draw of the program, especially before it developed a reputation
among federal judges, were its price (free), luxury accommodations (the
first was held at the Ocean Reef Club in Key Largo, and later seminars
were held at equally attractive locations), and high-quality instructors,
including Milton Friedman, Paul Samuelson, Armen Alchian, Harold
Demsetz, Paul McAvoy, and Martin Feldstein.74 The inclusion of Samuelson
was especially important, since it gave the seminars cover from
charges of ideological imbalance.75 Manne was careful to limit the course
to microeconomics, and to avoid any direct applications to legal issues.
Charles Goetz, a professor in later programs, recalls that this limitation
was not designed to avoid accusations of influencing judges’ decisionmaking,
but for pedagogical reasons.

The economics program for judges was pretty much straight economics. The
competitive model, capital values, discounting to present value, that sort of
thing. Henry Manne was concerned that judges were uncabinable if you tried
to bring any kind of express legal applications into the picture. Classes would
wind up being discussion of law rather than economics. Putting it bluntly . . .
judges are pretty hard to control. They’re petty monarchs in their own courtroom.
They’re not like ordinary students.
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 113

For two and a half weeks (reduced to two weeks a few years later), federal
judges would be marched through a tightly compressed course in microeconomics.
In addition to the formal teaching sessions, Manne encouraged
his faculty to mix informally with the judges in order to encourage
intellectual interchange and engagement with the material.76 At its height,
in 1990, the Economics Institute for Federal Judges had hosted 40 percent
of the federal judiciary, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence
Thomas, and sixty-seven members of the federal courts of appeals.77
The LEC’s seminars for federal judges have not been without controversy.
First, the seminars for judges, like those for law professors, were held
in first-class locations with opportunities for recreation in the afternoon.
This led to accusations that the seminars were junkets intended to influence
the decision-making of judges. Second, critics argued that the seminars
violated codes of judicial ethics, because they were funded by corporations
that judges could face as litigants. This was the charge of a challenge to
the programs brought to the Advisory Committee on Codes of Judicial
Conduct in 1980 by Charles Halpern, the cofounder of the Center for Law
and Social Policy at the Georgetown University Institute for Public Interest
Representation. Henry Butler, a close associate of Manne’s over the years,
recalls that this challenge did lead to a change in the financing of the
program. “In the process of discussing the LEC’s finances, Manne committed
to the Judicial Conference that the LEC would not use corporate contributions
to pay the direct expenses of the judicial education programs sponsored
by the LEC. All direct expenses for the judges programs would be
paid for with contributions from private foundations not affiliated with
corporations. Corporate contributions would be used to cover LEC overhead
and other activities, such as the Economics Institute for Law Professors
and Law for Economics Professors.”78 Ending direct corporate contributions
to the seminars has not satisfied the LEC’s critics, especially those
in the liberal legal network, who have continued to publish widely publicized
reports purporting to expose them as a form of judicial corruption.79
In recent years, this controversy has heated up, although it has focused
primarily on the seminars run by the Foundation for Research on Economics
and the Environment, which has successfully rebuffed accusations
that participation in its programs is ethically improper for federal judges.80
In fact, Manne made a point of avoiding telling his supporters that there
were any direct impacts on judges’ decision-making from the programs.
He recalls “a family foundation out in San Francisco that gave us a lot
of money, and finally withdrew it. They said that ‘you’ve taught us that
foundations oughtn’t give money if you can’t show results. Well, we want
you to show that you’re getting some impact from your judges’ program,’
and I said, ‘You’re going to take that one on faith, because one thing I can’t
do is claim to be having any impact on how judges decide cases.’ ”
114 CHAPTER 4

Manne always recognized that the effects of the judges programs were
diffuse—rather than trying to change judges’ decision-making on particular
cases, he was hoping to make them, at the margin, more open to economic
reasoning across the board.
Despite all the controversy that has swirled around them, Manne is
convinced that his program for judges has had less impact in spreading
law and economics than the Liberty Fund conferences or seminars for
law professors, noting that “the ultimate intellectual payoff [of teaching
judges], while perhaps more immediate, could never be as great as would
teaching the teachers.”81 That said, Manne is convinced that the judges
program was important, but as much for the attention it brought to the
LEC and the legitimacy it gave to the larger enterprise of law and economics
as for the actual impact on judges’ decision-making: “Law professors
and lawyers have almost a mystical regard for judges, so if they were
taking economics, it had to be okay.”
Manne’s programs required enormous funding, well beyond what a
university like Miami could raise on its own, and he was concerned that
the LEC might raise money that would be diverted to purposes other than
those of free market programming. In response, Manne chose the risky
strategy of relying on annual funding, rather than building up an endowment.82
In a letter to his supporters, Manne explained that

there should be no permanent endowment funding for the Center. Grants can
be conditioned on my continuing as the Director of the Center, and funds for
individual professorships can be conditioned on the chair’s being occupied by
a specific individual. This approach, however, leaves the Center somewhat vulnerable,
since its long term future is always in doubt, and this can be debilitating.
. . . In effect, what is required is good faith on the part of supporting foundations
and agencies that they will not unexpectedly withdraw financial support
from ongoing Center programs.83

Manne’s success at Miami, and to a degree at Emory as well, was in part
due to his impressive ability to extract resources from foundations and,
to a degree that has not been replicated in other cases examined in this
book, from corporations, without compromising his vision of the LEC’s
programming. The LEC’s fund-raising success was partially owed to
being founded before the explosion of conservative groups in the late
1970s and early 1980s.

There wasn’t much competition for that money—the competition came with

these think tanks that were beginning to start up. . . . [At Scaife] Dick Larry

always understood in some way what we were about, [but] what he really did
was he liked Dick Ware, the program officer from Earhart, who pioneered a
way of philanthropic giving that made more sense than anything. Find people
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 115

they trusted and give them money when they could use it. . . . Dick Larry often
used to say that I was always welcome to come in and make applications, because
I had always done well with them in the past. He never was able to articulate
why he liked what I had done, but it had always worked.84

At least in this early period, and to some degree even today, conservative
and libertarian foundations operated on the basis of “feel” and trust.
They identified people they agreed with and in whose competence they
had reasonable confidence, and did not ask a lot of questions or require
extraordinary documentation. These patrons recognized that in the law,
outcomes were long-term and difficult to reliably trace, and thus relied
on informal evaluations and reputations developed within the small network
of conservative founders and organizational entrepreneurs, rather
than more formal, bureaucratic methods.
Equally important as foundation support was Manne’s success in corporate
fund-raising. In the early years of the LEC approximately threequarters
of its support came from foundations and one-quarter from corporations,
but Manne was so successful in raising corporate money that
by the end of the decade the balance of support had been reversed (despite
level funding from foundations). As chapter 3 showed, business in the
early 1970s had become frightened by widespread challenges to corporate
capitalism, a fear that Manne successfully exploited. Manne’s initial insight
into corporate fund-raising was that the modern firm’s intellectual
capital was concentrated in its general counsels, who had advanced degrees
and were required to think about the corporation’s social, political,
and legal context. While these general counsels could not give very large
gifts, they “had their power of donation. . . . It was usually a small pot;
they had twenty-five, fifty thousand. A lot of our gifts were five to ten
thousand dollars. If you got one hundred donations, that’s pretty good.”85
Working with corporate counsels allowed Manne to sidestep corporate
philanthropy offices that tended to be more sensitive to the firm’s public
relations. Establishing this broad donor base also meant that Manne did
not have to worry about offending any particular firm. Diversity thus
provided an effective defense against capture by its corporate donors.
Manne’s fund-raising needs at Miami were considerably larger than
they were at Rochester, and his strategy had to adapt accordingly. Fortuitously,
soon after arriving in Miami, Manne met Bill Weston, who had
worked for J. Howard Pew (the benefactor of the Pew Family Foundation)
at the Sun Oil Company. Manne recalls that

I met him once at a conference some years earlier. . . . I’d say a month or so
after we got to Miami, he walked in the front door, said he wasn’t doing anything,
but he knew what I was doing and he’d like to help. . . . We were going
lickety-split trying to raise money, and at that point the mechanics of getting
116 CHAPTER 4

money out of corporations wasn’t clear. Fund-raising isn’t a one-person job;
you needed someone to do all the advance work, and that’s what he was willing
to do. Plus, he knew government affairs people—that’s another office that often
had money to give. Bill Weston was so good, the line I gave to general counsels
he gave to government affairs people, and he would get them to take a longerrange
view than they had. He really beefed up our fund-raising.

Manne’s connection to Weston gave him a staff member with networks
that allowed him to see possibilities for raising corporate money that were
invisible to most academics. Manne and Weston’s networks allowed them
to set up a fund-raising apparatus separate from, and thus not easily cannibalized
by, the University.
Manne made a direct appeal to corporation’s long-term self-interest,
but—in sharp contrast with the first generation of public interest law—
in the service of programming that he had designed for his own purposes.
Law and economics was attractive to corporations who recognized that
the growth of federal regulation was not a fad. Whether the appeal was
to antitrust, which hit at the core interests of large corporations, or the
new “social regulation” of the early 1970s, regulation was inescapable,
growing, and connected to a powerful support structure in universities.
Manne remembers that both he and Weston agreed that

we were not asking for charity. We didn’t even believe in corporations making
charitable contributions. Corporations had a long-range interest in what went
on in universities, and if they didn’t begin tending to it, it was going to jump
up and bite them. This was an easy line for the lawyers, because I could talk
about antitrust, the work that was done in product liability. . . . There were
other areas that the solid academic work academic guys were doing would be
useful to these guys, but they didn’t know anything about it. . . . To learn that
this could go on, and that this thing could be introduced in court was very
impressive to them. They had seen it already at this time in antitrust, you could
always use the antitrust example. . . . Weston did very much the same thing.
He’d talk to the government affairs people about getting materials they could
use in their work that they weren’t getting out of the university world at the
time. Law and economics . . . would be on their side, to put it very simply. Not
that we were tailoring things for their needs, but we were doing something that
they ought to buy.

Manne recognized that corporations could also be motivated to contribute,
despite the incentives to free ride, by leveraging their desire to “keep
up with the Joneses.”

Believe me, we always made them feel guilty about being free riders. We’d tell
them that others were supporting this, it was going to benefit them whether or
not they contributed, but others would look down on them. They were very
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 117

sensitive about that. There was a community among those people. They all
wanted to know, “What did so and so give you?” It would sometimes be a
company in their industry, but more likely it would be a company whose size
and importance they thought was like theirs. Like Sears might want to know
what did Exxon give. . . . If we could get an existing contributor to write letters
to people he knew at other companies, that was like social charity. . . . You give
to my pet charity, and I’ll give to yours.

Law and economics gave Manne and Weston a language through which
they could communicate with businessmen in terms they understood and
that made the long-term, relatively untraceable outputs of the LEC seem
like a good investment. “We were in business. Here we were producing
this stuff, trying to market it to you. Often we talked about it in those
terms, and this was something they understood. A few of them articulated
it as if they were entering into an informal contract to buy something. It
was an inchoate product, it wouldn’t be measured very easily, but the
thing came to be understood.”86 This common language was the cement
that got corporate donors into the door, and kept them there in the LEC’s
early years. Finally, Manne had a taste for fund-raising, an exceedingly
rare trait among academics of any ideological stripe. “What you were
doing was really like sales work, calling on people face to face, offering
your product and seeing if you could interest them. I grew up in sales, so
I did like it.”
Manne’s successful fund-raising allowed the LEC to expand rapidly. By
early 1975 he reported to Richard Ware of the Earhart Foundation, “I
can only preface the details by stating that we have been successful in this
organizational year beyond even my usually optimistic expectations. I
believe that we are already at the point I initially anticipated for our third
year. We have enough money pledged, assured, or on hand to begin every
specific program and project mentioned in the Prospectus sent to you last
fall.”87 Unfortunately, the LEC could not completely insulate itself from
the Law School, or the University as a whole. As Manne recalls, “In more
general terms, we weren’t a good fit. We were too good an operation, too
intellectually high-powered to be at the University of Miami.” The dean
of the Law School, Soia Mentschikoff, appeared to have been threatened
by the growth of the LEC, and attempted to limit its operations in a number
of ways. Manne wrote to the president of the University in early 1980
that his relationship with the dean had totally broken down. “Singlehandedly—unless
you want to take part of the credit through inaction—Soia
has destroyed my ability to manage personnel by raising tensions and
lowering morale to the breaking point. Every important member of the
LEC faculty and staff has actively sought other employment in the last
six months because of their fear of Soia and their realization that the
118 CHAPTER 4

university administration is either unwilling or unable to provide security
for them. . . . I give up.”88 Manne maintained much of the LEC’s momentum
by going over the dean’s head to the university president, but by 1980
his relationship with Miami was damaged beyond the possibility of repair.
Manne was looking for a way out, and was receiving offers to move the
LEC to other schools.89
In early 1980, Manne began negotiations with Emory University, and
by August of that year they were complete. The LEC’s exit was far from
amicable: a timeline in Manne’s files of the LEC’s transition to Emory
reports that, on November 12, the president of the University fired Manne
as head of the LEC, and that, on the following day, “Tensions became
very high at the Center as armed guards were posted, locks were changed
on various doors. Dr. Manne’s Secretaries were told to leave the building,
file cabinets were taped up, and Drs. Moore and Aranson were ordered
by Dean Walton to vacate their offices.”90 Conflict was especially severe
over fund-raising. Manne began to raise funds for the LEC at Emory while
still at Miami, while the University of Miami used the LEC’s mailing list
to solicit contributions from its donors. This suggests the importance of
Manne’s decision to avoid raising an endowment. Had he done so, he
would have been faced with years of conflict with Miami over its status,
rather than less than a year of severe but limited acrimony.
Despite the controversy that swirled around the LEC and Manne’s battles
with administrators at Miami, a very powerful organizational foundation
was laid for the law and economics movement in these years. When
the Manne programs were combined with the intellectual breakthroughs
being made by Richard Posner and Ronald Coase, among others, law
and economics had both a set of ideas whose power was increasingly
recognized and an elaborate network of programming to diffuse those
ideas throughout legal academia and the judiciary. It would turn out to
be a potent combination.

Early Adopters: UVA and USC

While law and economics made only small strides at elite schools beyond
Chicago in the 1970s, it became a major force in the law schools at the
University of Virgina and the University of Southern California. This
breakthrough was due to four factors: the move toward interdisciplinarity
in legal scholarship; the presence of creative, entrepreneurial deans looking
to increase their law schools’ status; at USC, and to a lesser degree
UVA, an institutional connection with nonlawyers working in the public
choice tradition; and the impact of the Manne programs in equipping law
professors with the basic skills to conduct law and economics scholarship.
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 119

The combination of these factors allowed UVA and USC to attract unusually
strong faculties at a rapid rate.91 Of particular importance for moving
the field into the mainstream, only a few of the scholars who were influenced
by law and economics at UVA and USC shared the strongly libertarian
instincts of its Chicago progenitors.
By the early 1970s, criticism of law schools as intellectually vacuous
and unsuited to the research expectations of the modern university began
to reach a critical mass. This same period was the high point of faith in
the social sciences, and these disciplines were obvious candidates for filling
the hole in legal scholarship that critics had identified. Combined with
these factors, the transformation of gender equality expectations put pressure
on the informal approaches to hiring in elite institutions. Richard
Posner recalls, “Certainly the way I was hired, it was a network . . . people
knew each other and so the people hired were all white males. When that
was challenged, the question was, ‘Well, if you’re not going to hire the
white males that you know, what are you going to use as your criteria?’
So they moved to criteria which seem more objective, having to do with
productivity and so on—using that for hiring or for promotion gives the
law school some insulation from complaints about discrimination.” The
rise of interdisciplinary scholarship and an emphasis on scholarly production
created an opportunity for lower-ranked institutions to dramatically
improve their national reputation. Robert Scott recalls that “this is a time
when there was a big transformation in American legal academics . . . the
integration of the law school with the rest of the university. With that
integration of interdisciplinary work came the integration of university
standards for productivity. All of a sudden writing original scholarship
became the sine qua non of a successful academic. I’m not sure it was
happening everywhere. I visited at Columbia in 1987, and it was just
beginning to happen [there].” Law schools more focused on their institutional
aspirations than their existing constituents could dramatically improve
their reputation by responding to this shift, because many top
schools continued to believe that the preeminent responsibility of the law
school was to the profession, not to the academy.
Taking advantage of this opportunity required leaders with the instincts
and authority to put interdisciplinary law scholarship at the center of their
school’s mission. At UVA, that leader was Monrad Paulsen, the author of
the best-selling casebook in America.92 Paulsen believed “it was supremely
important that the law school be engaged not merely in vocational training,
but in serving as an integral part of the university.”93 Michael Graetz
recalls that “Monrad was really transformative in pushing people on
scholarship. Monrad would go around asking, ‘What are you working
on?’ What he was doing was trying to hire younger faculty, a faculty much
more engaged in scholarship.” But while “Monrad was really supportive
120 CHAPTER 4

of the law and economics group . . . he was not a law and economics
person. Monrad was a real intellectual, he was interested in ideas.”
Paulsen’s strategy for transforming the law school at UVA was to “create
an appointments structure that gave a lot of power to the appointments
committee, and then stacked it with the younger people who he thought
were the more ambitious people in the law school. . . . He was willing to
take risks that many deans might not, in those days, have been willing
to take.”94 By the standards of legal academia, Paulsen was a genuine
entrepreneur, willing to disrupt existing organizational forms and practices
in order to take advantage of opportunities that other market actors,
especially schools above him in the law school status hierarchy, could not.
At roughly the same time, USC hired Dorothy Nelson as dean. Like
Paulsen, Nelson was not a law and economics scholar, but she was committed
to building the law school, and willing to take risks to do so. “By
1967, attrition had reduced the number of tradition-minded senior faculty
[at USC], and the appointments process had come under the control
of a diverse group of younger and more senior faculty united in the view
that law was about ordering social processes. . . . The understanding
could be theoretical or practical, philosophical or economic, but it should
not be merely doctrinal.”95 Michael Graetz recalls that Dorothy Nelson
“basically turned the appointments process over to the faculty. This was
a point where you had a group of faculty who were basically into the
‘Let’s build USC’ mode. So they were looking for interesting scholars.
They were also looking for something that looked cutting edge, and law
and economics at the time was pretty cutting edge.” USC could compete
by playing what George Mason University Law School later called “moneyball,”
hiring scholars who were undervalued by the market and ignoring
the credentials by which faculty at the time were typically judged.96

They weren’t as interested in the superficial credentials that would mark a good
appointment in the old system. They probably couldn’t have competed for Supreme
Court clerks or guys who finished first in their class at the Harvard Law
School. So they were looking for people who were really smart and intellectually
interested, but for whatever reason whose academic career was a little more
academically checkered, who chose not to clerk or who went to a lesser law
school. They were willing to make their decisions based on the quality of the
mind and the ambition of the individual, and were willing to trust that instinct,
rather than what was at one time the sine qua non, which was being a very
good law student.97

A willingness to seek out the unorthodox made USC a magnet for those
committed to the intellectual transformation of legal scholarship. Graetz
recalls that “when I went back to USC in 1979, I had an offer from Chicago,
and I decided that USC was every bit as interesting a faculty as
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 121

Chicago.” Douglas Baird similarly recalls that when he graduated from
Stanford in the mid-1970s, “I desperately wanted a job at USC because I
didn’t think I could get a job at Chicago. I wanted to be where the action
was, and if it wasn’t Chicago, a close second was USC.” USC took an
approach that some law schools were willing to accept at the margins,
and by making it the dominant theme of the school USC created a huge
competitive advantage. While the story was not simply one of law and
economics—the school was open to other disciplines as well—no field
was as mobilized to take advantage of the opportunity.
USC, and to a lesser degree UVA, became early adopters of law and
economics in part due to their connection to the rising centers of public
choice scholarship. Public choice in economics and rational choice in political
science apply rational, hedonistic, behavioral assumptions to the
decision-making of government. While law and economics scholars devoted
much of their attention to demonstrating the inadequacy of existing
legal frameworks, public choice purported to explain that inadequacy by
focusing on the motivations of political actors.98 The public choice connection
at USC came through its close relationship with Caltech, where a
number of law faculty (including Graetz, Schwartz, and Levine) had joint
appointments.99 Levine recalls that “the Caltech group profoundly influenced
and greatly broadened my notion of what interdisciplinary work
entailed. They gave me a perspective and analytical tools with which to
address the obstacles that prevented adoption of regulatory policies that
would produce efficiency gains. . . . It helped explain the seeming paradox
that a careful economic analysis of law and policy, however eloquently
and persistently put forth, did not seem to carry the day politically and
influence real-world outcomes.”100
UVA Law was in the same university that gave birth to the “Virginia
School” of public choice, including economists James Buchanan, Gordon
Tullock, and Ronald Coase. Former UVA faculty members Michael
Graetz, Jerry Mashaw, and Warren Schwartz recall that there was a significant
influence of the Virginia School on the economically minded professors
in the UVA law school, through the meetings of a reading group
called Pegasus that connected them with the public choice scholars at
Virginia Tech and UVA.101 Charles Goetz, however, recalls that, by the
time he arrived in 1975, the connection with the economics department
was much less substantial than it would have been just a few years before,
given the exodus of the Virginia School that began with Ronald Coase in
the early 1960s and was largely complete by the early 1970s.

At that point Tullock was at Rice, Coase was at the University of Chicago,

Buchanan went off to UCLA. . . . The reason why there wasn’t much interaction
with the Department of Economics was, there were still some people like Bill
122 CHAPTER 4

Bright and Leland Yeager, but there was a big falling out in the Department of
Economics itself, so by the time I arrived in 1975, if you spoke to the people
who were on one side of the wall, the other people became your enemies. It was
that bad. I basically was unable to have any interaction with the economics
department at all, in those years, nor do I recall anyone who did.

Therefore, while there was some cross-fertilization with the Virginia
School, it does not appear to have been the main conduit for economic
thinking in the UVA Law School.
The most important connection between the Virginia School and UVA
Law was Goetz himself, who had been a professor of economics at Virginia
Tech, the home of Buchanan and Tullock’s Center for the Study of
Public Choice. Goetz got on Virginia’s radar screen when he met Warren
Schwartz at a talk in Blacksburg, where Schwartz recalls that “he just
knocked my socks off, and I thought, ‘This guy would just be perfect for a
law school,’ which I got right. I don’t remember exactly how, but Virginia
decided they would like to hire an economist, and I was assigned the task
of finding one. . . . The first person who visited was Isaac Ehrlich.102 ...
We offered him a job, which he declined. Then I thought of Goetz.” Goetz
was a student of Coase, Buchanan, and Tullock at Virginia in the early
1960s, but when he moved to the Law School, he quickly committed to
being more than the economist on the law faculty.

The one difference between me and the other early people in law and economics
is that I . . . decided that I would give myself at most four or five years to learn
enough law that the people on the faculty, my colleagues, would regard me as
a legal scholar, as opposed to just an economics guy grafted in there. I made a
very concerted effort to learn the closest equivalent of microeconomic theory
in the substratum of law school discussion, the fields like contracts, tort law,
civil procedure. . . . That meant that I could then talk to people in different
areas who often came to me for some kind of advice or insight. . . . Just to give
you one example: This seems incredible now, but back in 1975, the whole notion
of the applicability of the prisoners’ dilemma and game theory . . . to legal
problems was new. . . . Even people who had been to Henry Manne camp had
no knowledge of elementary game theory, and that turns out, as the years go
by, to be an important tool in legal analysis.103

In addition to spreading economic concepts in the law school, Goetz became
part of one of law and economics’ most fertile collaborations, with
Robert Scott. Goetz recalls,

I had an office on the third floor . . . and I could hear an argument between Bob
Scott and Warren Schwartz over liquidated damages. . . . Economists had been
hostile to liquidated damages, thinking, wrongly in my view, that liquidated
damages would impede efficient breaches. Scott and Schwartz were arguing
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 123

over this, Scott arguing in favor of liquidated damages, at least under certain
circumstances. I remember once jumping up and walking down the hall and
saying to Warren, “Bob is right, and I can prove it.” By the next day I had an
economic model; several of them became incorporated into the article. . . . That
argument in the hallway wouldn’t have taken place in a lot of places.

While the Manne seminars created a common language for the UVA faculty,
the presence of a skilled economist on the faculty meant that economic
theory could constantly feed into the intellectual life. Schwartz recalls
that “Charlie [Goetz] was very much the tutor for all the rest of us.”
Robert Scott believes that these “arguments in the hallways” were very
important in his own development as a law and economics scholar.

Warren Schwartz had an important role because he . . . spent most of the day
chatting with colleagues. I remember several lunches with Warren and [others]
. . . in which my first memory was someone talking about Coase, and I had
no idea who Coase was, so if I was going to be with these guys I’d better know
a little bit about what they were talking about. So I did take that occasion to
get . . . the first edition of Economic Analysis of Law. I read Ronald Coase’s
“Problem of Social Cost.” . . . So I was knowledgeable about the nascent law
and economics movement, but I hadn’t integrated it significantly into my own
scholarship. . . . I started writing an article on the constitutional regulation of
procedural due process that was subsequently published in the Virginia Law
Review. In the course of conversations with a number of colleagues, Mashaw
certainly was an important one. . . . I read more and that article was my first
law and economics article. . . . That article was written in the academic year
1974–75, and that spring Graetz and Jeffries and I signed up to go to Florida
for Henry’s program.

Proximity breeds creativity by facilitating unplanned interactions and arguments
and increasing the emotional intensity of scholarly interaction.
At UVA, adding additional people with common interests (especially
those who combined complementary intellectuals skills with broad interests)
produced increasing intellectual returns.104
The other explanation for the rapid spread of law and economics in
Virginia’s faculty was the disproportionate impact of Manne’s Economics
Institute for Law Professors. According to Manne, “In the first three
years the program, we had half of the UVA faculty, and that’s because
Monrad pushed it. I would take anyone Monrad nominated.” Dean
Paulsen was a close friend of Henry Manne’s, a drinking buddy at AALS
meetings and a former summer roommate at UCLA in the late 1950s,
so it was natural that he would turn to Paulsen to help drum up interest
in the economics institutes. Goetz recalls that the impact on the Virginia
Law School “was enormous, because Manne managed to attract to these
124 CHAPTER 4

summer programs some of the really big names in the law, not just big
names of those who were already established, but those who were up
and coming, like Jerry Mashaw and Graetz, and they became quite excited
about economics. The Manne summer camps were important in
the sense that they gave some of these people who were early attendees
a common language, and they were able to find linkages that cut across
the substantive fields.” It was that common language that structured the
intense intellectual environment that produced some of the most important
figures in law and economics over the next few decades: Graetz,
Scott, Mashaw, and Warren Schwartz were among the UVA attendees in
the early years of the program.105
Of the two programs, UVA seems to have been able to hold onto its
position as a leader in law and economics, while USC has declined somewhat.
Both schools developed Olin Law and Economics Programs, but
UVA retained many of its core faculty for decades, while USC lost most
of its faculty and was not able to match UVA in recruiting new law and
economics scholars. In 2001, as the Olin Foundation began to wind down
operations, it reported that, at UVA, “the Law School’s dean, John Jeffries,
is an enthusiastic supporter of the Program and has made the financial
commitment necessary to sustain the Program at a level of funding at
least half of the current budget.”106 UVA Law built its impressive reputation
with the assistance of law and economics, and it appears that it has
become an institutionalized commitment of the school.

A Beautiful Dream: Trying (and Failing) to Create Hoover East at Emory

His relationship with the University of Miami having become acutely
unpleasant, Manne began looking for a new location for his Law and
Economics Center. The opportunity to move the Center to Emory University
came with the appointment of Tom Morgan (an alumnus of the
professors’ institute) to the deanship of the law school. Morgan knew
that Manne was eager to move and, upon becoming dean, “the first thing
he did was approach me about coming to Emory.” When Manne made
his move to Emory, the University had just begun its rapid move up the
ranks of American higher education, driven by the Woodruff family’s
(the owners of the Coca-Cola Company) extraordinary donation of
$100 million in 1979. Manne arrived a year later and, in 1981, President
Jimmy Carter took a position at the University, dramatically increasing
its visibility.
Emory seemed in 1980 to be the ideal location for the Law and Economics
Center: a university rapidly growing in prestige and wealth in the
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 125

most important city in the Southeast. Manne’s programming increased
substantially in his first few years at Emory, and he had a strong ally in
Morgan, who put the LEC at the core of the Law School’s research
agenda. Morgan’s 1981 Status Report on Emory Law argued that

with the coming of the Law and Economics Center to Emory, the Law School
has an unparalleled opportunity to become what few law schools even aspire
to and fewer even come close to being: a school with sufficient breadth of view
to be called a school of jurisprudence. Emory will have a natural advantage in
bringing together a group of first rate scholars interested in applying the rigorous
logic of economics to the study of law, and should exploit that advantage
to the extent possible.107

The Olin Foundation, Manne’s most important patron, was also encouraged
by Manne’s move to Emory, noting that “the Center at Emory will
enjoy a much better faculty, the stature of a much finer University, and
the close cooperation of the Emory administration.”108 Manne had at
Emory what he lacked at Miami—a sympathetic dean and a university
rapidly increasing in prestige—to accompany his patron support. What
he lacked was the most basic, but essential resource in academia—space.
As banal as this may seem, it was a fight over space that eventually led
Manne to fall out with Emory’s administration, and more critically, with
the Olin Foundation.
At the start, Manne’s relations with the Emory administration were
very warm. “[President James T. Laney] welcomed the center, agreed to
put up a million dollars. . . . My error [was that] I didn’t really know
before I got there how inadequate the facilities were. We had eight or ten
people, and there were some in the law school, in that little tiny house. It
was inadequate.” Just as it became clear that the LEC needed more space,
Manne learned that an architecturally remarkable facility, the Simmons
Building (also known as the Gulf&Western or Jones Bridge building),
twenty miles away from the Emory campus, had come onto the market.109
Along with housing all of Manne’s staff, the building had space for the
LEC’s seminars and room for other activities.

At that time, the Simmons company, an Atlanta bedding company, sold out to
ITT, a very generous supporter of the Law and Economics Center—they were
very interested in antitrust. . . . Simmons had built the most glamorous building
I had ever seen. . . . It was all redwood, copper, and glass, sitting on 125 acres
of virgin forest, on the Chatahoochie River, which was a trout stream at that
point, twenty miles out from Emory, in Gwinnett County, which was just starting
not to be an outlier. You could tell the real estate was going to go up there.
ITT acquired this building, and decided it was too glamorous for any of their
subsidiary companies. . . . One of the guys told me about it, maybe we could
126 CHAPTER 4

make a deal. There was something in the tax laws called a bargain sale, in which
by manipulating numbers, a piece of property is sold at a discount price, and
the difference is allowed as a charitable contribution for the corporation. The
arithmetic worked out. . . . It was almost ready-made for my more ambitious
plans for it.110

Manne quickly approached John M. Olin about supporting the purchase
of the building, a request that he received sympathetically, based on his
previous support with Manne and his friendship with Robert Woodruff.
He directed Manne to submit a formal request to the Olin Foundation.111
Manne approached President Laney with the idea, and “Jim approved it.
He said, ‘If you raise the $3 million, I’ll get you the $1 million and we’ll
buy it.’ ”112 Laney wrote in May 1982, “I can’t tell you how pleased I
am with the work you have done to date to develop Emory’s Law and
Economics Center and particularly to find a more adequate physical facility
. . . We all join with you in your enthusiasm for the Simmons Building
on Jones Bridge Road in Gwinnett County and believe this would make
an excellent addition to both the Center and the University.”113 With both
the Olin Foundation and Emory’s leadership on board, Manne believed
the way was clear to buy the building.
Manne believed that the purchase of the Simmons Building would turn
the LEC into a major component of the free market organizational infrastructure.
In May 1982, Manne made clear to John M. Olin that the
building represented a rare opportunity for the conservative movement.

What I have reference to is the whole cause of free market and conservative
ideology in American universities. There is literally only one academic building
in the country housing a number of respected and influential conservative scholars.
That is the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. And successful as the
Hoover Institution has been, it has always lacked a certain influence because of
its location on the West Coast and because, as a one-of-a-kind institution, many
intellectuals do not take it seriously. The building we want for the John M. Olin
Law and Economics Center would be an East Coast anchor of conservative
intellectual thought comparable to the Hoover Institution on the West Coast.
Indeed two such activities, geographically separated, would lend more credibility
to the work of each. Because of our special emphasis on economics for lawyers,
law professors and judges a properly housed John M. Olin Center would
likely become one of the most influential academic operations of its kind in the
world, one to which the most distinguished thinkers would repair on visits or
research leaves. Further, the Center would become a world focal point for conferences
and other programs concerned with the free enterprise system. I believe
that this kind of presence would be a more significant association for your name
than merely a building or the Center as it presently operates.114
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 127

Manne believed that the ideological instincts of American university administrators
made this opportunity very unusual, one that if squandered
could not be easily replicated.

I am not sure that many people understand how completely left-leaning American
universities are today. Emory in that regard is no better nor worse that the
rest of them. It is simply understood and accepted by most administrators,
professors and trustees that American universities will be dominated by people
with extremely liberal views. . . . Our president, Jim Laney, is thoroughly confused
by the appearance of a successful and intellectually respected conservative
activity like the Law and Economics Center. Nonetheless, the people running
our universities are trapped to some extent by their finer, older traditions;
they must tolerate dissent, even when it is most distasteful to them, as with
anyone proclaiming the virtues of individualism and free enterprise. But toleration
is not support, and it is rare for a university to make things easy for a
group with our point of view. The Hoover Institution has been a festering sore
for a number of left-wing academics at Stanford for years, as in a smaller way
has the Law and Economics Center, both at Miami and at Emory. But if we
can fund our own way and maintain high standards of work, there is literally
nothing they can do except brood about our expansion and our influence. But
a lot of people here are unhappy with the prospect of the Law and Economics
Center having such a handsome facility; they understand very well that we will
be a much more potent intellectual force if we make that move. Unfortunately,
without the move, we may disappear altogether. In other words, we hang precariously
between an enormous increase in our importance and a possible slide
into obscurity.115

Some discount probably should be applied both to Manne’s hopes for the
Simmons Building and his fears if its purchase fell through: he was, after
all, trying to convince John M. Olin to increase his financial contribution
to its purchase. That said, Manne seemed to sincerely believe that conservatives
were strangers in American higher education. What opportunities
they had came from institutional norms of “fair play” that provided small
openings for conservative mobilization, but only if those cracks were skillfully
and expediently taken advantage of.
It is difficult to say whether this perception of Emory’s administrators
(and to some degree those of other institutions as well) was accurate.
Laney had every reason to be unsympathetic to a major conservative project
at Emory, especially one connected to law and economics. Laney was
a political liberal and close to President Jimmy Carter—the Carter Center
was located next to Emory and was envisioned to come under its management
after Carter’s retirement.116 Laney was also a believing Christian of
the liberal, social-justice-oriented variety, having studied under Niebuhr
at the Yale Divinity School in the 1950s. One indication of Laney’s beliefs
128 CHAPTER 4

can be seen in a speech he gave to the United Methodists (the denomination
that sponsored Emory) in 1992: “Our dominant philosophy also has
a down side—a kind of unrestrained individualism that ignores the social
fabric. It tends to spawn an ethos of disregard. Individuals pursue their
own interests, but those interests are sometimes terribly self-centered. The
last few years have revealed what the excesses of laissez-faire individualism
lead to when there is not a concomitant concern for larger responsibility.”117
Laney imagined the university as a corrective to individualism, a
community dedicated to moral improvement and growth.
The program of the LEC, by contrast, was devoted to the “laissez-faire
individualism” that Laney found so distasteful. Worse, with private funding
and a building off campus, it would have been difficult for Laney to
exercise meaningful control over Manne’s empire-building. Manne concedes,
“I’m sure he saw that this would be Henry Manne’s empire, trading
on Emory’s name, and he wouldn’t be able to control it. And he was a
control guy. If I’d been president, I’d have been a control guy. . . . Given
my proclivities, if, say, Ralph Nader had wanted to do the same thing, I
think I would have put stumbling blocks in the way.” Manne and his
staff, in fact, believed that the Simmons Building would insulate them
from the University’s control. Lewis Rockwell, an LEC staff member at
the time, wrote to Manne in March 1982,

I vote for Jones Bridge. . . . It would be far easier to raise money, because of
Jones Bridge, than because of an ordinary building here. At Jones Bridge, we
would have the premier meeting facility in the conservative world. No one—
not Hoover, not AEI, not Heritage—could compete with us. The building itself
would raise money for us. . . . We would not be putting our trust in modern
universities and the kind of people who administer them. We would have all
the advantages of the university connection, and very little of the disadvantages.
Here on campus, we would be having continuous troubles with the administration,
just because of the nature of the people in it.118

Roger Miller, who had been with Manne since the founding of the LEC,
concurred in this latter judgment, stating that “the reliance on the good
will of a few individuals is a weak basis for locating on campus.”119
Manne told Michael Joyce early on in the negotiations that

an activity like the L&EC requires very careful and delicate tending in any respectable
American university. The instincts and the politics of most people who
manage universities run contrary to everything we stand for. We have certainly
not escaped their attention at Emory, nor do I think we would at any university
of this quality. To some extent we are and will always be strangers on a campus:
actually we are “free riders” on an edifice that is run by our ideological enemies.
All of this is by way of saying that my decision to go for the Simmons Building
was designed to give us a degree of security here that we certainly do not have
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 129

at present, could not likely secure elsewhere, and could not have with President
Laney’s alternative proposal for a small office building on campus.120

Manne’s deep suspicion of his own university and his conception of
academic politics as a battle with his “ideological enemies” explains his
high-wire efforts to salvage the Jones Bridge location and the conflicts
they engendered.
With the purchase of the building reasonably far advanced, Emory’s
administration withdrew its support for LEC’s off-campus location. The
Olin Foundation’s account of these events claims that, in July 1982, “the
Board of Trustees of the University rejected the Simmons Building as a
location for the Law and Economics Program. They apparently thought
the building was too far from the campus. . . . Laney, we gather, concurred
in this judgment.”121 Following on this rejection by the board, Laney proposed
that the foundation put up $1.5 million to match the university’s
$1 million, which would be used to build an on-campus facility for the
LEC, a building that would also house the economics department. This
new offer may have been driven by predictable administration desires
to use outside money to cover ordinary university functions. The Olin
Foundation was unsympathetic to paying to house the economics department,
and the university revised its proposal, with the foundation paying
$1.5 million to build the facility and the university donating $1 million
to endow the LEC. While this was going on, the purchase price for the
Simmons Building dropped to $2.5 million—the exact amount that Olin
and Emory had on the table—and Manne tried to convince Laney of the
merits of shifting back to the Simmons Building option.122
Confused by the “mixed signals” coming from Emory, the staff of the
Olin Foundation invited President Laney in October 1982 to speak with
the foundation’s steering committee. “Laney was advised by the Steering
Committee that it was up to the University to decide once and for all
which of the alternatives it preferred. . . . At the meeting, Laney made a
strong pitch for the Simmons Building.”123 However, in this meeting,
Laney was informed by Olin Foundation president William Simon that
the foundation would support the university’s preferred location,124 thus
contradicting his understanding that the foundation’s support was contingent
on the off-campus location, and in the process undercutting Manne’s
position and credibility. Laney reversed course and, in November, the University
officially requested support for the on-campus location. “Manne
objected immediately to this decision, stating his strong preference for the
Simmons Building. He told Laney that he would not cooperate with the
proposal, and would inform the Foundation of his objections.”125 In fact,
Manne proposed to the foundation that he be allowed to purchase the
building independent of the university, a proposal the foundation rejected.126
Laney took Manne’s actions as a personal affront. “By your
130 CHAPTER 4

action in recent days, you have failed to acknowledge and abide by my
decision and have subverted Emory’s efforts to raise money for an on
campus location. It is a matter of record that you informed the John M.
Olin Foundation that you opposed the proposal which you originally
drafted on the University’s behalf for the on campus solution. Your conduct
in this instance is unacceptable and clearly would not be tolerated
from any other member of the University community.”127 Convinced that
the University and Manne were not on the same page, the Olin Foundation
Steering Committee withdrew its support from the project. It was at
this meeting that the foundation also decided to pull its funding from the
LEC’s Olin Fellows program and to pursue the possibility of creating law
and economics programs at elite law schools, which will be discussed in
detail in chapter 6.128
His relations with Emory’s administration in tatters, Manne made a
last, desperate gambit to establish the Center as an independent operation.
Separation from Emory only increased the scope of Manne’s ambitions,
and he entered into a partnership with his old friend from the University
of Rochester, Richard Rosett, dean of the University of Chicago
business school from 1974 to 1983, to form the “Chattahoochee Institute.”
Rosett’s stature in the academic community (he was later appointed
dean of arts and sciences at Washington University), combined with his
friendship with Manne, made him a natural choice for helping to resuscitate
the project.
Relieved of the connection to a university, Manne proposed to move
the LEC’s programming beyond training judges and professors, to include
virtually all senior-level decision-makers in America. Manne observed
that, traditionally, knowledge diffused to decision-makers in one of two
ways: publication in scholarly journals or through traditional classroom
teaching. To these Manne proposed to add a third:

Courses tailored for senior level executives, attorneys, and government officials,
taught by scholars selected for the importance and influence of their scholarship
and for their skill in teaching. Examples are courses in economics for corporate
counsel, finance theory for executives with an engineering background, regulatory
law and theory for chief executive officers who must take positions on
pending government proposals, or accounting and marketing for trustees of
not-for-profit organizations. The Institute will provide a communications shortcut,
enabling business and government leaders to become sophisticated consumers
of new ideas that ordinarily reach them along conventional routes.129

The objective of these programs was to counteract what Manne saw as
the liberal bias in the information that executives received, in the process
reshaping the perspectives of American decision-makers.
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 131

Expanding the LEC’s training programs was only the beginning of
Manne’s plan for “Hoover East.” The institute would play host to other
sympathetic organizations (such as the Mont Pelerin and Philadelphia
Societies, the Atlanta Lexecon office, and smaller conservative foundations)
as well as providing a home for new organizations, such as an
international law and economics association and an association for economic
expert witnesses. The new institute would also use its expertise
in economic consulting, providing assistance in the selection of expert
witnesses, and helping “translate” between economists and lawyers. On
top of these initiatives would be an aggressive research program with
visiting scholars, sabbatical programs, postdoctoral fellowships, and
an expanded research staff.130 Manne proposed to push the combination
of entrepreneurship and free market research much further than he
had before.
By May 1983, Manne and Rosett believed that their Hoover East plan
would reach fruition. Rosett wrote Manne at the time that “the excitement
still is not fading. I have examined the idea from every angle I can
think of and its appeal grows steadily. I have tried to work out a plan that
will allow us to move ahead with some confidence that the Chattahoochee
Institute will come into existence and that it will have the importance it
deserves.” The risk of the institute’s plan, given its detachment from an
academic institution, clearly weighed on Rosett. “You will see that I am
giving myself more than one option and as much safety as I can manage.
I expect that you will want to do the same.”131
What finally killed the efforts of Rosett and Manne to bring the Hoover
East project back to life was the implacable opposition of William
Simon. Manne asked Rosett to go to New York to make a final pitch for
the newly redesigned project, but Simon turned him down flat. Rosett
recalls, “I went to the Olin Foundation and talked to Mike Joyce and
told him what I wanted, and he said, ‘You ought to talk to Bill Simon.’
He ushered me into a room where I met Bill Simon for the first time. . . .
He told me there were no circumstances where he would support any
activity of Henry’s.” Despite John M. Olin’s personal support for the
project, Simon had lost trust in Manne due to the crossed signals coming
from Emory, and, given Simon’s dominant position in the foundation,
that meant the Simmons Building project was finished. As many involved
with the foundation agree, Simon was a man of strong opinions, who
relied on his gut instincts, and he had decided (perhaps on the basis of
imperfect information) that the foundation should burn its bridges with
Manne.132 It was only due to the support of other members of the board
(including George Gillespie, Olin’s private lawyer) and some of the staff,
that the foundation continued to support the seminars for federal judges
despite Simon’s hostility.
132 CHAPTER 4

Manne aimed high and he fell hard. He lost any chance of acquiring
the Simmons Building, the funding for his Olin Fellows program was eliminated,
and the finances of the LEC were withering. The distraction of the
Simmons Building negotiations had taken an especially heavy toll on the
LEC’s previously careful nurturing of its financial supporters. The LEC
depended on Manne’s personal connections, reputation, and attention,
and once these became frayed, the momentum of the LEC began to stall.
By 1984, Manne was forced to plead with foundations to maintain his
core programs, the economics seminars for law professors and judges.
The Olin Foundation grudgingly agreed that

Manne is not without his weaknesses as an administrator, and has probably
brought the bulk of his economic woes upon himself. Still, staff is sympathetic
to this particular request [for the judges institutes]. . . . While the precise impact
this economic training has had on legal decision-making is difficult to
gauge, many recent decisions reflect a sound understanding of economic principles,
and indicate how important it is that judges have a background in economics.
One such case in point is the recent decision by the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals to reverse the District Judge in the State of Washington on
a comparable worth ruling. The decision explicitly reinforced the supremacy
of market forces in determining wage and price values. . . . Staff thinks the
cancellation of the Economics Institute would represent a significant loss to
the legal community.133

While the “sexiest” programs from the point of view of the foundation
were maintained, much of the rest of the LEC, especially its training of
students, had unraveled.

The main thing we lost was the fellowships, and the fellowships just gave a
spark to the whole thing. . . . We lost a lot, and [had we stayed at Emory] I’m
not sure it [the LEC] would have survived. I sure didn’t like the idea of staying
on as a full-time law professor at Emory. Tom Morgan by that time had left; in
my last year there was another dean there. He had moved on to be the dean at
George Washington. The new dean didn’t have a clue what it was all about.134

By 1983, Manne had lost his opportunity to create Hoover East, and the
Law and Economics Center, which just a few years earlier was one of
the conservative movement’s most impressive assets, seemed to be coming
unraveled.

Conclusion

By the early 1980s, law and economics was becoming part of the mainstream
of academic law. The meteoric rise of Richard Posner gave the
L AW AND E CONOM I C S I 133

movement a bona fide intellectual superstar, whose notoriety forced the
rest of legal academia to take law and economics seriously and sent powerful
signals to young scholars that prestigious careers could be forged in
this once-exotic field. Posner’s work built on the foundation laid by Director
and Coase, which points to the importance of the Chicago Law
School’s role in nurturing law and economics in its early years, despite
the fact that it was still out of fashion in the larger world of legal academia.
Had Chicago not performed this function, it is unlikely that law
and economics would have experienced the explosive entry into the legal
mainstream made possible by Posner’s emergence. At the same time that
the Posner phenomenon burst on the legal academic scene, the movement
developed important outposts at Virginia and USC, where budding law
and economics practitioners could learn from, compete, and collaborate
with each other. Just as important, the law and economics professors at
UVA and USC were not Chicago-style libertarians, and as they moved on
to more prestigious law schools, they helped eat away at the perception
that the approach was simply thinly veiled ideology. This legitimated law
and economics in the legal academic mainstream, and opened the way to
its institutional advances in the 1980s and 1990s.
Of equal importance was the entrepreneurial work of Henry Manne,
who successfully operated on both the demand and supply sides of the
movement. Manne’s institutes for law professors equipped a remarkable
number of legal academics with the techniques necessary to apply law and
economics to new fields, and increased the receptivity of the profession to
those scholars’ insights. At the same time, Manne’s programs for federal
judges ensured that many members of the federal bar could understand
the concepts that these professors were developing, which meant that the
courts would not have to wait on a wholly new generation of judges to
absorb these new theories. Of even greater long-term significance,
Manne’s programs helped to build networks of law and economics scholars
across the country in a period when most of the movement’s personnel
were widely scattered across the country and isolated in their home institutions.
When this intellectual and network entrepreneurship was combined
with the increasing scope of law and economics’ ambitions, the
stage was set for entry into the legal mainstream in earnest in the 1980s
and 1990s.
The 1970s and early 1980s were a period of remarkable organizational
success and significant setbacks for law and economics. Given how scarce
entrepreneurial skills are in the academy, had Manne invested his talents
in pure scholarship (as he might have, if he had been appointed to an elite
law school in the late 1960s), it is far from certain that anyone else would
have built the movement’s organizational infrastructure. It was only because
of the still-powerful barriers to entry to the legal academy that
134 CHAPTER 4

Manne’s efforts were deflected in this direction. In his organizational entrepreneurship,
much of Manne’s success came from trial and error, and
not from a grand plan. In the area of fund-raising, Manne only slowly
discovered how to draw large sums of money from corporations without
compromising the intellectual focus of his programming, something that
the leaders of the conservative public interest law movement were not
able to do. Despite his success in raising money and building enthusiasm
for the movement, Manne’s path was not without obstacles. At both
Miami and Emory he operated under administrators who were not enthusiasts
for the project of law and economics, and his conflicts with them
limited his entrepreneurial reach. In a series of events that show that the
movement was far from a well-oiled “giant right-wing conspiracy,”
Manne had an almost complete falling out with the Olin Foundation by
the early 1980s. In short, the organizational successes of law and economics
in this period were far from inevitable, might not have occurred without
Manne’s specific skills and commitment, and were limited by internal
conflict within the conservative movement itself.
Ironically enough, however, it was this very conflict that set the stage for
the next steps in the movement’s organizational evolution: the creation of
the Olin programs in America’s elite institutions and the resurrection of
Manne’s plan to build a law and economics law school. We will return
to these programs in chapter 6.

The Federalist Society: Counter-Networking

THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY IS ACKNOWLEDGED, by friend and foe, to be
an organization of extraordinary consequence. Liberals, fearing a “giant
right-wing conspiracy” in the law with the Federalist Society at its head,
have been alarmed by its role in judicial selection and have devoted significant
time and resources to producing detailed studies of the organization.1
On the right, conservatives have lavished praise on the Society for
helping to “turn the tide” against liberal control of the legal profession,
the law schools, and the courts.2 Others are impressed simply by the federal
judges and Supreme Court justices, top conservative legal professors,
and prestigious private lawyers who attend its annual meeting. All of this
focus on the Society’s members—the articles they have written, decisions
they have handed down, presidents they have hunted—leaves the Society
as an actual, working organization somewhat in the shadows.
This chapter, by contrast, focuses primarily on the Federalist Society itself,
asking three fundamental questions about its development and place
in the larger conservative legal movement. First, what explains the rapid
growth of the Society, given the dismal fortunes of the conservative public
interest law organizations described in chapter 3? How did it avoid falling
into their “organizational maintenance” trap? Second, why did the Society’s
leaders choose to act as intellectual and network entrepreneurs rather
than orient the organization more directly at legal change? Third, what
explains the growth over time in the Society’s functions and ambition?
The key to answering these questions and correcting misconceptions
about the Society is the concept of “boundary maintenance.” There is a
strong tendency in most of the popular writing on the Society to conflate
the activities of the organization itself with those of its members. For
example, during the Clinton impeachment saga it was common to read
that the president was being hunted by “Federalist Society lawyers.” This
was true in the sense that many of the president’s pursuers were Federalist
Society members, but false in the specific sense that the Society as an
organization was not involved.3 Nevertheless, it is probably the case that
the networks produced by the Society made such activities easier than
they would otherwise have been. I suggest as much below, describing these
as the “indirect outputs” of formal Society activities. The Society has been
faced with opportunities to expand into the activities its detractors claims
136 CHAPTER 5

it engages in, and has refrained from doing so because of concerns over
organizational maintenance. An organization that did what many people
think the Federalist Society does would not, and could not, look like the
Society that exists today.
What is it, then, that the Society does? It is best understood as a provider
of public goods (in the welfare economic sense) to the conservative
legal movement. First, it engages in recruitment of law students and practicing
attorneys who can identify with and participate in the movement.
Second, it invests in the human capital of members through frequent debates,
which acquaint them with conservative legal ideas and heighten
their intellectual self-confidence, and through their participation in its student,
lawyer, and practice groups, which provide leadership experience.
Third, the Society produces cultural capital, in that its activities facilitate
the orderly development of conservative legal ideas and their injection
into the legal mainstream, reducing the stigma associated with those ideas
in institutions that produce and transmit professional distinction. Fourth,
and perhaps most importantly, the Society is a producer of social capital
in the form of networks that develop as by-products of Society activities.
In the absence of an organization like the Federalist Society, these movement
public goods would be produced in a haphazard, uncoordinated,
and redundant fashion, if produced at all. Organizational entrepreneurs
would have seen their transaction costs escalate significantly, to the point
where some activities would not have been worth pursuing.
Why did the Society’s activities cohere around these functions and not
others? To explain this, I pay particular attention to the choices its leaders
made in shaping the Society’s organizational structure. While it is probably
true that, given the context of the early 1980s, some organization of
conservative lawyers would inevitably have formed, it was not predetermined
that it would look like the Federalist Society or that it would effectively
manage the organizational maintenance problems that face all such
projects in contemporary American politics. It matters a great deal that
the opportunity to build a network of conservative lawyers was seized by
the particular individuals who formed the Federalist Society. Had others
been the first movers, it is highly unlikely that the organization would
perform the functions it does. The importance of leadership in the conservative
legal movement is even clearer when the Federalist Society is compared
to the first generation of conservative public interest law firms (as
discussed in chapter 3), which had a very different sort of leadership, and
very different outcomes.
The key decision this entrepreneurial cadre made was to narrow its
mission to facilitating the activism of its members and influencing the
character of intellectual debate rather than directly influencing the actions
of government itself. The Society has aimed to deepen the character of
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 137

legal thought in conservative circles, rather than proposing doctrines of
its own. It has tried, through its activities, to make conservative lawyers
aware of each other, thereby activating latent resources for the conservative
legal movement, rather than plan overall movement strategy and organizational
development. It has sought to make conservative lawyers
aware of opportunities for political and legal participation but has not
itself engaged in litigation or lobbying. The Federalist Society, in sum, has
pursued an indirect approach to legal change, one that operates as a focal
point for discussion and as a safe harbor for individuals who feel isolated
from the mainstream of American legal culture. This strategy of indirection
was dictated by its initial organizational commitments to intellectual
debate and a desire to serve as a hospitable environment for the entirety
of the conservative legal movement. Indirection has served the organization
well. The leadership of the Society has been happy to see the fruits
of its labors harvested by other organizations, which have been able to
take advantage of the networks and resources the Society has produced.
The key to understanding the Society’s ability to attract resources despite
their diffuse outputs has been their close relationship to patrons willing
to invest for the long term.
To understand the role of the Federalist Society in the conservative legal
movement, it is necessary to focus on how it solved some basic problems
of organizational design, in particular the establishment and maintenance
of organizational boundaries. As I argued in chapter 1, the modern activist
state created a change in the character of modern parties. With more of the
governing apparatus outside of direct electoral control, partisan mobilization
has shifted to new sites of contestation, such as the professions and
the universities, where many of the key resources for elite political change
are rooted. Understanding the Federalist Society requires that we situate
its rise and development as part of a larger effort to mobilize against the
entrenchment of the liberal legal network. The critical factor in explaining
why opportunities are seized or lost in this sphere of political competition
is the decision-making of organizational entrepreneurs, and here the movement
was lucky in the character and continuity of the individuals who
founded the Federalist Society. Had people with other interests and abilities
filled the organizational space taken by the Society, the history of conservatives
in American legal institutions could have been very different.

Founding the Federalist Society

The Federalist Society was founded by a small minority of law students
embedded in what they saw as a hostile institution, America’s law
schools. For both strategic and personal reasons, the Society’s founders
138 CHAPTER 5

responded to this hostility by creating an organization with a central commitment
to intellectual debate. This founding organizational mission has
been sustained by a leadership cadre that has, with only small adjustments,
controlled the Society for its first quarter-century and will, in all
likelihood, do so for another two decades.
The first Federalist Society activity was a symposium on federalism at
Yale Law School held in April 1982. At the time, active conservative law
student organizations existed at Yale, Chicago, Harvard, and Stanford,
although not all of the chapters were formally known as the Federalist
Society. The inspiration for the symposium was the organizers’ belief
that “law schools and the legal profession are currently strongly dominated
by a form of orthodox liberal ideology which advocates a centralized
and uniform society. While some members of the legal community
have dissented from these views, no comprehensive conservative critique
or agenda has been formulated in this field. This Conference will furnish
an occasion for such a response to begin to be articulated.”4 The conference
was intellectually ambitious but organizationally modest: none of
the organizers anticipated that the symposium would lead to anything
like the modern nationally organized and funded Federalist Society. As
Lee Liberman Otis recalls, “We did not know [we were] starting a national
organization when we started this. Basically what . . . we at Yale
and we at Chicago thought about this [was that] we were starting organizations
at our schools.” The original proposal showed the modest expectations
that accompanied the first conference: “If it is successful, we
would hope to make such a conference annual or periodic occasions for
reflection on the ways in which the law and the development of legal
principles affect society.”5 While the earliest ambitions of the Society’s
founders were intellectual rather than organizational, hints of its eventual
function as a network of conservative lawyers were in evidence even
at this time. The organization provided financial support for students to
come to the symposium from law schools across the country, and its
organizers announced their hope that they would “participate in the discussion
following each address, and would also have the opportunity to
exchange ideas with the speakers between meetings, during the informal
reception and over meals.”6 Networking was built into the organization
from the beginning.
The founding symposium of the Federalist Society attracted enormous
attention in the national press, in the conservative movement, and among
conservative law students. Gary Lawson, at the time a law student at Yale,
recalls that

once the stuff all dropped in our laps, of course we’re going to do something.
. . . We had student groups in 1981 writing to us and saying, “How do
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 139

we start an organization?” What are we going to do, say, “We’re going to have
this conference at Yale and then disappear”? It all really started with conferences.
The major event was the conference in 1982, but we started that with the
idea of having one panel. We had Bork and Winter at Yale, Scalia and [Professor
Edmund] Kitch at Chicago and we thought, “Wouldn’t that make a fun panel
on federalism?” That just steamrolled into a whole conference. We had people
from other schools calling us up, wanting to be part of the conference. We had
people who wanted to come in from a thousand miles away and start their own
chapters. That was the first sign that there was something there. There’s a void
in that market waiting to be filled.

Steven Calabresi also uses a market metaphor to explain the emergence
of the Federalist Society, to some degree underplaying his role as an entrepreneur
and emphasizing instead the existence of an enormous untapped
demand for an organization.

My original objective—I started the Yale Chapter when I was a second-year

student at Yale Law School—was to have some good debates, to bring some
conservative speakers to Yale, where I don’t think any conservative voices were
being heard, force faculty members there to confront the ideas by debating who
we were bringing in. . . . We held a conference in 1982; it was held by the folks
at Chicago and by the folks at Yale. The folks at Chicago were friends of mine
from my undergraduate days at Yale—Lee Liberman Otis and David McIntosh.
Our conference was covered by National Review and suddenly conservatives
at fifteen other law schools began calling us and telling us they wanted to attend
the conference and they wanted to form chapters too. That was a process of
almost spontaneous generation. It turned out there was an enormous demand
at other law schools for the kind of thing we felt a demand for at Yale.

Conservative law students alienated in their home institutions, desperate
for a collective identity, and eager for collective activity provided a ripe
opportunity for organizational entrepreneurship. What was undetermined
at the time, however, was how this opportunity would be directed,
and by whom.
By the end of the summer of 1982 the Society’s founders were well on
the way to tapping into this unmet demand by attracting funding from
conservative foundations. In a letter to Richard Larry of the Scaife Foundation
in August 1982, Lee Liberman Otis noted, “While there now exist
a number of organizations which are beginning to provide a counterweight
to the liberal public interest law groups, no comparable effort has
been made at the law school level.”7 Echoing Michael Horowitz’s broadside
from two years earlier, the Society’s founders pointed to the intellectual
vacuum at the core of the conservative legal counterestablishment,
and argued that changing legal culture through the education, recruit-
140 CHAPTER 5

ment, and development of young conservative lawyers was an essential
counterpart to investments in litigation. Changing legal culture required
shaking the self-confidence of liberal lawyers by challenging their perception
that they had a monopoly on serious legal thought. An October 1982
proposal observes that by “encouraging conservatives to present their
ideas more articulately and more vocally, it [an organization of conservative
law students] could cause others to listen to these views more attentively,
and, perhaps ultimately, to question some of the liberal positions
which are being presented as the law.”8 Conservatives were insufficiently
“articulate” and their ideas poorly developed, and the budding Society
claimed that they could build an organization that could help make conservative
ideas both convincing and respectable.
Early on in its development, the Society looked to create a membership
larger than law students. In its original 1982 proposal, the Society proposed
a tripartite organizational structure, composed of student, law
faculty, and lawyer divisions. While speakers, symposia, and publications
were at the core of the Society’s mission, these purely intellectual
activities did not exhaust its ambitions. Number 5 in the proposal’s list
of activities was placement, which it claimed was dominated by the liberal
legal network: “Conservatives have long bemoaned the fact that
clerkships to prominent conservative jurists have often gone to people
with liberal views. Similarly, it has been contended that far too many
legal posts in governmental offices (even those not controlled by civil
service regulations) have been held by liberals under Republican administrations.
Finally, it is generally acknowledged that there is an insufficient
number of conservative law school faculty.”9 A placement service
run by Professor James McClellan of the University of Virginia was proposed,
along with a “job exchange section” in the Society’s newsletter.
The proposal was prescient in its prediction that “simply through its
existence, the Society can be expected to create an informal network of
people with shared views who are interested in helping each other out
in the placement sphere. It will in fact be one of the national organization’s
goals to develop key relationships with judges, legislators, governmental
counsels and practitioners. To some extent, through the Yale
symposium, this has already begun to take place.”10 From its founding,
the Society’s leaders hoped that “simply through its existence” conservatives
might gain sway over jobs in conservative administrations and in
the courts. Early in the Society’s development it crowed to patrons about
members’ success in obtaining prestigious clerkships and other positions,11
but it looked for its greatest impact in placement to come as a
by-product of the Society’s other activities, rather than as an explicit,
formalized function of the organization.
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 141

While they did not direct the Society’s development, the support of
senior members of the conservative legal movement was essential in this
period. By the fall of 1983, the Society had a permanent office and a fulltime
director, Eugene Meyer.12 Perhaps the most important elite sponsor
of the Society in its early years was then-professor Antonin Scalia, who
first helped connect the Yale and Chicago contingents with the conservative
law group at Stanford,13 helped them with fund-raising, spoke at their
first conference,14 hosted visiting Harvard Law Federalist Society members
at his home when the Society had its conference at the University of
Chicago Law School, and facilitated the Society’s early move into an office
at the American Enterprise Institute. Michael Horowitz also played a critical
role in getting the Society off the ground, no doubt recognizing that
it was doing what he had called for in his report to the Scaife Foundation.15
As Lee Liberman Otis recalls, Horowitz

found us after we started. . . . He was really excited to find out that this thing
existed. And he was full of ideas, people he knew. . . . He did help us a little
with foundations, but also I think he helped us with just meeting other conservative
lawyer types in Washington. For example, I clerked with a fellow named
John Schmidt who became deputy counsel to Vice President Bush. Mike Horowitz
came up with the idea that John should meet Boyden Gray who was then
counsel to Vice President Bush. He just knew everybody, basically, and so if we
were looking for speakers or things like that he would be able to help us with
stuff like that.

Finally, Kenneth Cribb, first as an advisor to the attorney general and
then as assistant to the president for domestic policy, was an early an
important ally in the Reagan administration. Cribb recalls,

I was always looking for people who would come and work on the president’s
agenda without self-calculation, and that describes these Federalists. They’re
loyal to a philosophical principle that Reagan was trying to accomplish, and
they weren’t trying to [ideologically] position themselves for personal gain, so
they were very valuable. . . . In any event, after Meese had been appointed attorney
general . . . Judge Bork said there’s one person you must hire when you’re
setting up the Justice Department, and that’s Steve Calabresi. . . .So he was the
first one brought in, and he became a special assistant to the attorney general,
then David McIntosh, who was practicing law in Los Angeles. . . . So I hired
David second; he was also a special assistant to the attorney general.16 Lee [Liberman
Otis] had been hired independently by William French Smith at Justice,
so she was there when we came over in 1985. . . . In terms of the signal it sent,
[hiring the Federalist Society founders showed that] the Reagan administration
thinks what they’ve accomplished in terms of founding the Federalist Society is
important, and worthy, and we’re going to give them good jobs. I think a third
142 CHAPTER 5

sense is that young, idealist-oriented students saw that you could win that way,
you could succeed if you acted honestly on the basis of your ideals, as opposed
to maneuvering and telling people what they want to hear and playing both
sides of the street. It was a signal that if you do the right thing you’ll go further
than if you manipulate. It’s a good moral example.17

Society membership was a valuable signal for an administration eager
to hire true-believers for bureaucratic hand-to-hand combat.18 In addition,
by hiring the Society’s entire founding cadre the Reagan administration
and its judicial appointees sent a very powerful message that the
terms of advancement associated with political ambition were being set
on their head: clear ideological positioning, not cautiousness, was now
an affirmative qualification for appointed office. In its early years Federalist
Society membership carried a stigma within legal academia, but
it was precisely the willingness to bear this stigma that made Society
membership a valuable signal of true-believership for conservatives
in government.19
The nascent Federalist Society was beginning to connect conservative
law students from across the country, and the involvement of Scalia, Horowitz,
Cribb, and Gray connected the Society to the conservative legal
establishment. In recognition of how far the organization had come, just
four years after its modest founding journalists were already describing
the Society as part of the “Conservative Elite.”20

Building Chapters

The Federalist Society moved rapidly to open chapters in as many significant
law schools as possible. This could be done spontaneously, up to a
point, by building on the outpouring of interest produced by the Yale
symposium. The Society’s founders sought to guide this budding movement
even before they developed a national office, by distributing “How
To Form a Conservative Law Student Group,” a document that provides
a window on the Society’s early goals and methods.
David McIntosh recalls writing the document with Otis “literally a few
weeks before the first conference, because people were asking and we
realized, ‘This is an opportunity, we’re bringing fifty people together, let’s
have at least something they can take home with them to think about how
to do it.’ ” The document emphasized the Society’s intellectual mission to
“stimulate thought and discussion about the applications of conservative
principles to the law.”21 Cognizant of the wide range of conservative
thought, the proposal noted that the Yale Federalist Society “provides a
sense of community for its members who span a broad ideological spec-
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 143

trum which includes traditionalists, fusionist conservatives, libertarians,
objectivists, classical liberals and Straussians.” Aware that these ideological
divisions posed significant dangers to the movement, the proposal recommended
that student chapters

should not use the adjective “conservative.” This is for several reasons. There
is no need to become involved in disputes among conservatives, libertarians
and other factions about what they call themselves. A number of people may
be hesitant about identifying themselves as conservatives, although they may
share most of your views. Additionally, although it is important to have some
ideological identification among members of the groups, a number of nonconservatives
may want to come to your events and participate in the group,
and there is no need to make them feel uncomfortable. . . . Finally, if the group
wishes to issue statements on national or law school policies, or even if it does
not, it will have greater credibility if the name does not make the group appear
too unobjective.22

This passage points to two fundamental dynamics in the Society’s early
development. First, the founders had a strong desire to avoid factionalism.
Previous conservative student groups, like Young Americans for Freedom,
were rife with such conflict, to the point that their energies were squandered
in internecine conflict. “One of the easiest ways for groups of students
interested in politics to fail to accomplish as much as they would
like,” the paper observed, “is for them to become bogged down in internal
politics.”23 The Society was obviously aware of such a danger, and from
the beginning consciously tried to avoid it.24 As McIntosh recalls, “I noticed
that there was often a tendency for conservatives to be critical of
each other, and . . . some of that was product differentiation, but some of
it was [that] culturally it is a lot easier to get into a fight with a fellow
conservative because you’re both outliers to the mainstream of American
culture. It’s a lot harder to get into a debate or a fight with the law school
or legal establishment.” Second, the Society sought to make its ideas attractive
to those not previously affiliated with conservatism. Factional
infighting ran the risk of turning off outsiders, a serious danger since the
personal experiences of Society leaders convinced them that “conversion”
was possible. Steve Calabresi recalls that

there was definitely a feeling of conversion, that . . . there were people who
could be turned around. Most law students had grown up in liberal families,
had gone to good schools where the viewpoints being heard were mainly liberal
and . . . they were essentially liberal out of lack of awareness of conservative
ideas. Some of that was fueled by our lack of personal pasts in conservatism....
I was originally a moderate Democrat, and I was persuaded by Reagan that
conservative ideas were right, but I was definitively a liberal who became a
144 CHAPTER 5

conservative. Lee Liberman was definitively in the same position, David McIntosh
was in the same position. We tended to assume that if we could make
the transition, other people could also, so long as we made a good persuasive
argument for the things we believed in.

The Society’s leaders thought there was a constituency for their ideas beyond
the hard core of self-identified conservatives. Convincing them, not
simply providing succor for the hard core, was the principal objective of
the Society.
The Society’s emphasis on debate, rather than just sponsoring conservative
speakers, was evident from the beginning. The original “how to”
document makes the motivation clear: “You are more likely to convince
people of your viewpoint if they feel the other side has been given a fair
hearing.”25 As Calabresi recalls, “If you just bring a famous conservative
and the audience hears that but thinks, ‘Well, sounds good to me, but I
think one of my professors probably could have critiqued it and then I
would have understood where they were wrong.’ By having the professor
there on stage with them they get to see it and evaluate the ideas.”26 Otis,
Calabresi, Lawson, and McIntosh had all been active members of an undergraduate
debating society, the Yale Political Union, an experience that
each of them identified as important in shaping their ideas for how to
organize the Society. McIntosh remembers that “Lee, Steve, and I as undergraduates
and Gary when he was at Yale [were] very involved in a
debating society [which] meant that we embraced the classical liberal notion
that a debate about ideas is a healthy thing because the truth will
emerge from that. And that strong belief . . . led us to instill it as an organizing
principle for the organization. We’re all very politically oriented
people, so [without that experience] you could have seen a different ethic.
There was also a genuine intellectual commitment to debate.” Gary Lawson
notes that “you don’t have an interesting discussion if you don’t have
people disagreeing, [if you have] pep rallies.” Eugene Meyer argues that
the debate orientation came about because “we think in a fair debate
these ideas are really strong and we’ll win. Two, if it’s a really fair debate
and you keep losing, you sure better figure out why if you’re intellectually
honest. [One example is] original intent and original meaning. To some
degree some of these discussions and debates led not all but most conservatives
to abandon original intent and adopt original meaning.”27 An orientation
to debate also had the consequence of moderating factional conflict.
Despite their differences, in debates conservatives and libertarians
would find themselves agreeing with one another more than with the liberals
on the other side. The original, foundational commitment to debate
made the organization open and attractive to outsiders, moderated fac-
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 145

tional conflict and insularity, and had a tendency to prevent the members’
ideas from becoming stale from a lack of challenge.
After having established a strong foundation of student chapters, the
Society moved on to develop its lawyers division, beginning with its first
and most important chapter, in Washington, D.C. The D.C. chapter was
founded by Stephen Markman, a young conservative lawyer serving as a
staff member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Markman was approached
by active members of the Society in early 1985, Michael Horowitz
in particular, because his position on the Judiciary Committee gave
him strong connections to legal conservatives in the administration and
on the Hill. As Markman recalls,

I thought it would be a way in which we could provide a greater focus for those
individuals who shared . . . conservative judicial and constitutional values, and
of course I knew there were a great many people in Washington who did in fact
share those values, but it was all far more amorphous back in those days—there
was no regular meeting group. There’d been a couple of aborted efforts by the
Heritage Foundation and some other groups to have that kind of meeting, [and
while] they did serve their own purpose, there really was no principal focus for
people who shared those views.

In its early years, the D.C. chapter helped conservatives across government
shape the movement’s still fairly underdeveloped legal ideas by facilitating
freer debate than is typically possible within the day-to-day routines
of the executive branch and Congress. Markman believes that the
intense interactions facilitated by the D.C. chapter played a key role in
the evolution of “originalist” jurisprudence.

Ed Meese at this time had originated not the idea, but the nomenclature of

original intent jurisprudence. This was later refined, refined I believe in a very
useful way to original meaning jurisprudence, but remember at this time the
stuff of debate was still kind of the old Nixonian terminology of strict contructionism
and law and order jurisprudence, and this was a very clumsy way of
referring to the ideas I think united people who congregated around the Federalist
Society. I think that one of the interests in getting together was trying to try
to refine our debate, to try to render more sophisticated what it is we were
talking about, and many of our speakers contributed to that. I think the language
of interpretivism or textualism or original meaning jurisprudence—these
things were all aired and the subject of a great deal of discussion at Federalist
Society meetings.

Steven Calabresi believes that the Society has had a continuing impact in
shaping the evolution of conservative thought, and speeding the transition
from the older tradition of judicial restraint.
146 CHAPTER 5

Before we existed there were a handful of conservative scholars, but they
weren’t in contact with each other. By bringing them together, putting them on
debates and things, I think we’ve to some extent helped to bring together a
homogenous, mature set of conclusions on things that people on the right agree
on, about how particular legal problems should be addressed. One example
might be the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment. I think at the time that we
started there were some members of the Federalist Society, some of our leading
scholars, who were very skeptical of expanding the takings clause. They
thought it violated judicial restraint, they thought it might hark back to a return
to Lochner v. New York. I’d say in particular Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia,
who were very involved in this from the beginning, were very hesitant about
expanding the takings clause. Then there were people like Richard Epstein who
thought everything was a taking.... Both of those positions have gradually
been rejected by most members of the Federalist Society, so today most members
of the Federalist Society believe there are some things that are regulatory takings,
and in that sense the takings clause has been expanded beyond where it
was in 1981. Even Scalia now on the Supreme Court goes along with that view
and has written cases like Nollan.
28 That reflects to some degree the interest in
the takings clause among Federalist Society members.... That may be a case
where having conservatives and libertarians . . . debating this issue and fleshing
it out, and having members listen to it, has led to the emergence of a position
that was not the original position of either of the advocates of that matter.

By encouraging intense and sustained interactions among its members,
the Society—in particular, its D.C. chapter—has created the deliberative
conditions necessary for convergence in the ideas of the conservative legal
movement’s various factions.
While it is easy to emphasize the networking function of the Society,
the most significant fact about the Society is what its networks center
around. The sense that something is at stake in the speakers and debate
that the Society sponsors gives the Society an emotional and intellectual
edge. Especially for those members of the Society who had participated
in it during their law school years, the D.C. chapter provided sustenance
in what could easily be an intellectually stultifying environment. McIntosh
recalls, “I was a young lawyer in government and [the D.C. chapter
meeting] was a great opportunity to see friends who were spread around
the Reagan administration and hear a debate similar to what we had done
at the Society meetings or the national conferences, when your daily activities
didn’t let you do that as much. So I think there was a sense of people
missing that academic debate, and this was an opportunity to keep being
involved in that.”
The most important by-products of the D.C. chapter’s intellectual debates
were the networks it created across the federal government. The
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 147

D.C. chapter helped overcome the atomization and lack of coordination
that is an unavoidable danger in our “government of strangers.”29 Markman
recalls that networking “was obviously one of [our] interests—it was
also . . . to try to identify more individuals who shared those values with
whom one could seek assistance . . . knowing somebody in the Commerce
Department who shared your perspectives [was very valuable].” Based
on his experience as head of President George H. W. Bush’s Council on
Competitiveness, David McIntosh found the D.C. chapter’s networks especially
valuable in overcoming the intrinsic informational challenges of
coordinating action across the executive branch.

Our formal role [was] to ensure that the president’s policy preferences were
taken into account in the agency rule-making, and yet we had no staff, half a
dozen people by the end and some staff support from technical people at OMB
who monitor these regulations. Being able to attend the Federalist Society lunch
and hear from people who were either at an agency or at a law firm working
on some of this issues meant that I had a much better sense of what was happening
on issues that were taking place. . . . One of the folks at OMB told me, . . .
“David, you’ve been getting the mushroom treatment.” And I said, “What do
you mean?” and he said, “You’re kept in the dark and fed shit.” And by that
he meant the information flow was being controlled by the agency and we were
expected to at the last minute ride herd on this for policy reasons. So having a
group of people who were friends and talked freely with each other opened up
an alternative information source.

The D.C. chapter reduced the transaction costs of governing as a conservative.
It allowed Society members to identify allies in other agencies,
thereby facilitating the flow of information, helping ideas to germinate
and spread, and allowing members to escape from the “agency view.” As
we will see later in this chapter, this network function of reducing transaction
costs (especially those connected to the search for information) has
also been vital where judicial appointments are concerned.

The Growth and Funding of the Federalist Society

Whether one focuses on its budget, members, or programs, the Federalist
Society has grown dramatically over its first two decades. How did the
Society manage to finance this growth given its diffuse and hard-to-measure
goals? The secret to the Society’s success is the diversity in its sources
of support, in particular the (financial and in-kind) contributions of its
members and the long-term support of conservative foundations.
The Federalist Society budget has gone through four basic phases,
which can be identified (as in figure 5.1) by funding plateaus. The first,

from 1982 to 1986, saw the organization’s budget go from around
$120,000 (measured by revenues in 2006 dollars) to a little over $1 million
by 1986, where it stayed for the next few years.30 The next big jump
was between 1989 and 1993, when the budget rose to $1.6 million.
Fund-raising steadily increased from 1993 to 1997, as the budget exceeded
$2.5 million, and the growth since then was gradual before
sharply accelerating in 2001. The Federalist Society’s activities, with the
exception of its two national meetings, are conducted primarily through
its student chapters (in law schools), lawyer chapters (by city), and practice
groups (organized by functional interest). The growth in the student
and lawyer chapters can be seen in figure 5.2.31 In a shift from the evolutionary
pattern of the lawyers and student chapters, the Society’s fifteen
practice groups were created at the same time, in late 1995, funded by a
$100,000 grant from the Wiegand Foundation.32 Since then, the practice
groups have created subcommittees, but the basic structure has remained
the same.
The Society’s membership tracks the expansion of its budget and chapters
(see figure 5.3).33 It evened off somewhat in the mid-1980s, increased
dramatically in the wake of the Bork nomination, and went up enormously
during the Clinton administration.34 The latter finding may be
somewhat surprising. The Society’s skeptics typically argue that it is a
“job network” for conservatives, but some of its strongest growth occurred
during a period when the Democrats controlled executive branch
appointments and the power to nominate federal judges. Thus, it is rea-

sonable to hypothesize that the Society is most effective when Republicans
are out of office. Conservatives may be drawn to the organization more
when it is least powerful, as a forum in which challenges to existing government
policy can be developed, relationships formerly established in
government can be maintained, and networks can be preserved when governmental
office is no longer there to provide ongoing contact and esprit
de corps.
Discovering a way to fund the growth the Society has experienced over
the last two decades, without distorting the goals of the organization, has
been one of its most fundamental challenges. The Federalist Society has
flourished in part because of its increasingly wide base of support. The
Society is less dependent on third-party support than almost any similar
organization, because of its members’ substantial in-kind contributions
and membership dues. The leaders of the student, lawyer, and practice
groups are, for the most part, not compensated,35 even though they put
in tens of thousands of hours a year performing Society-related tasks.36
Lee Liberman Otis notes that “if you try to cost out the in-kind contributions
of members, it is enormous, because they are all lawyers, so their
time is very valuable.” The Society recognized early on that building its
membership base was essential to its success. In a letter to Michael Joyce
in 1984, Eugene Meyer observed that “in the long term, we intend to
obtain a significant percentage of our funding from members of the legal
community. This is why we feel developing some activities involving lawyers
is essential.”37 While the Society created its Lawyers Division for

other purposes, the desire to identify a pool of donors who had a personal
connection to the Society played a significant role. Today, over two-thirds
of the Society’s high-dollar ($1,000 or more) individual contributors are
Society members.38
Despite the substantial resources represented by Society volunteers, the
organization has always needed to raise money. Like most of the institutions
of the conservative legal movement, this funding came from a handful
of relatively small conservative foundations, while support from business
or law firms only came much later, after the Society’s basic
organizational norms and structure had congealed. Through October
1983, the Society spent a grand total of $103,000, 95 percent of which
came from six conservative organizations, and 5 percent from dues and
fees.39 Meyer believes that the key to the Society’s fund-raising success has
been the distinctiveness of conservative foundations.

[Foundations usually ask] What have you done? Well, we’ve helped change
some of the debate on the Constitution. But what have you done? I can’t answer
that in the type of compelling way . . . [such as] Senator So-and-So wouldn’t be
a senator but for this, or even such and such a bill wouldn’t have passed....
That’s true of policy organizations generally unless they are lobbying organizations....
There’s definitely in the philanthropic community a big emphasis on
measurable results. I understand that. The only problem I have is that you have
to have the judgment to know what sort of measurement you can reasonably
expect for certain kinds of goals. The leading conservative foundations have
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 151

had more of a long-term outlook.... That is what foundations should be
for. . . . You can understand that if you’re doing a new group, a certain percentage
of your grants will fail, the group won’t work, and you have the same costs
that any other entrepreneur in the business world has—that’s the way business
works. If you can choose intelligently you’ll start some really good businesses
or really good organizations.

Conservative foundations were especially vital in the Society’s early years,
when funds from corporations were scarce, and they have stayed with the
Society ever since. Foundation leaders had been exposed to the Horowitz
Report’s message that conservatives needed to focus on legal ideas and the
recruitment of law students, priming them for the pitch that the Society’s
leaders brought to them. James Piereson at the Olin Foundation, Michael
Joyce at Olin and then later at the Bradley Foundation, and Richard Larry
at the Scaife Foundation established personal relationships with the Society’s
leaders, creating bonds of trust that permitted a more aggressive and
long-term style of grant-making than would have been possible without
them.40 With less need to focus on fund-raising in its early years, the Society
was able to eschew direct mail and corporate support and focus its
energies on its members and the programming and services of interest to
them.
As soon as it established itself as a permanent organization, the Society
sough to increase its organizational reach by using elite supporters such
as Bork and Senator Orrin Hatch to expand its donor base beyond foundations.
A 1985 letter from Otis to Abraham suggests that Hatch supported
aggressively expanding Society fund-raising from an early point.

Brent Hatch (son of the Senator) says his father was very impressed . . . [with]
the caliber of the people in the Society, and wanted to know what he could do
to help. In particular, he thought we could do a lot with “real money.” Brent
unfortunately told him that he thought we had already raised $300,000, and
didn’t think we needed help; but I’m sure that misimpression can be corrected.
David [McIntosh] thinks we should make a blueprint for a $1 million organization
and present it to Hatch. . . . In any case, I think we should meet with Hatch
sometime next week, while he still remembers his enthusiasm.41

A 1988 memo shows that the follow-up with Hatch must have been successful;
he was one of the first two successful prospects for a Federalist
Society Development Board.42 A central goal of this project was to create
a board of trustees that could contribute or commit to raising $50,000,
as well as a National Legal Advisory Council, whose members would
commit to $10,000.43 Both of these new committees were intended to
broaden the reach and networking of the Society, as well as provide intelligence
on “the organization’s perceived reputation within various sectors
of the legal community.”44
152 CHAPTER 5

Boundary Maintenance

All organizations have to determine the boundaries of their membership
and mission. While some scholars have argued that political organizations
have a natural tendency toward growth, rooted in the self-interest of organizational
leaders, the development of the Federalist Society suggests that
this is far from an iron law.45 The key to the Society’s boundaries has
been its self-imposed prohibition on “position taking,” a constraint that
distinguishes the Society from ordinary interest groups and explains why
it has repeatedly turned down opportunities to grow. This section will
identify two of these foregone opportunities—a proposed litigation center
and rating of nominees for the federal bench—and show how the Society
has regulated its members’ behavior and limited the use of the Society for
the personal interests of its leaders.
At the beginning of the George W. Bush administration, a number of
Federalist Society members who were nominated for positions in the Justice
Department were quizzed about the organization. For example, Viet
Dinh, who was being considered for the position of assistant attorney
general, was asked by Senator Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), “So is your belief
that the Federalist Society does not have a philosophy, a stated philosophy,
when it comes to, for example, the future course of the Supreme
Court?” Dinh responded, “No, I do not think it does have a stated philosophy,
to my knowledge. It may very well have. I just simply do not know.
I know that the Society has a very diverse membership of people who
think very critically about these issues, and I know that I’ve gotten into
many, many disagreements with members of the Federalist Society on
these kinds of issues. So I do not think that an official policy would be
possible, even if desirable.”46 In a similar exchange, Edith Brown Clement
was asked, “Do you share a judicial philosophy with the Federalist Society?”
to which she replied, “I am unaware of any judicial philosophy
articulated by the Federalist Society.”47
Any number of reporters and columnists found these denials to be unconvincing,
and depending upon what one means by a “judicial philosophy,”
they were. There is no question that the Federalist Society is held
together by some very broad, overarching principles, the generality of
which is suggested by Sen. Orrin Hatch’s (R-Utah) description of the Society’s
philosophy: “The Federalist Society espouses no official dogma. Its
members share acceptance of three universal ideas: One, that government’s
essential purpose is the preservation of freedom; Two, that our
Constitution embraces and requires separation of governmental powers;
and, three that judges should interpret the law, not write it.”48 Meyer
notes that the distinction between these “principles” and “policy positions”
is far from obvious.
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 153

The statement, “We don’t take positions” is more accurately, “We don’t take
policy positions.” In other words, when we say in our statement of purpose
that we are interested in the current state of the legal order and separation of
powers, the rule of law, individual freedom, and [that] certainly the role of the
judge is to say what the law is, not what it ought to be—obviously those are
positions. Those are the positions we take. Beyond that, the fact that something
promotes individual freedom doesn’t mean we’re going to support it.... Does
that broad set of principles affect what our programming is? Of course it does.
It’s designed to bring those things to the fore. We make sure in our program
. . . that those general principles are strongly advocated in addition to other
principles. That’s where we stop. But once again, where we stop and someone
else picks up can make the line seem fuzzy.

This denial of position-taking could easily be seen as a ruse, but this would
be a critical mistake, since stopping short of drawing out the policy or
legal consequences of its principles serves vital organizational maintenance,
enhancing the Society’s role in the larger conservative movement.
Michael Oakeshott’s distinction between enterprise and civil association
is useful for clarifying this point. Enterprise associations are defined
by their goal: members join because they agree with its goals. Civil associations,
on the other hand, provide a common venue, resolve disputes, and
establish rules for interaction. Oakeshott observed that the mode of civil
association is very difficult to maintain in a pure state, since at some point
people need some general notion of why the forum that the procedures
make possible is desirable, some assurance that it is oriented toward a
morally defensible end. On the other hand, a pure enterprise association
has a tendency toward collapsing in on itself, becoming insulated and
antiparticipatory. All organizations that seek some form of membership,
therefore, usually end up between these poles.49
The Federalist Society has positioned itself primarily as a civil association,
focusing almost exclusively on fostering debate and providing services
to its members. While its critics have often interpreted its role
through the frame of other Washington-based organizations, the Federalist
Society is not an interest group, and it does not engage in many
of the activities its opponents attribute to it. This is not because the
organization finds anything intrinsically wrong with such activities—it
works closely with organizations that involve themselves in litigation
and judicial confirmation battles, and these activities are made easier
because of the networks the Society has fostered. The Society could not
involve itself directly in these activities, however, and preserve its organizational
structure and distinct mission. The vital distinction here is activities
the Society actually engages and those that we might call “externalities”
of its core function.
154 CHAPTER 5

A useful example of how the Federalist Society has consciously limited
its mission is its consideration in the mid-1980s of a litigation center. This
would seem to be a natural extension of the organization’s mission, given
that Michael Horowitz’s criticism of conservative law firms was still fresh
in the movement’s mind and that the Center for Individual Rights and the
Institute for Justice would not be founded for years. In addition, as Meyer
notes, “If you get a group of lawyers with a broad set of principles, what
do lawyers do? They sue someone. We had litigators involved with us;
they wanted to use their talent. A lot of our lawyers were involved in pro
bono work.” However, the litigation center never got off the ground, and
other organizations stepped in to fill the void. Why didn’t the organization
take advantage of this opportunity to expand its reach?
The litigation center was seriously considered, and hints of interest in
the idea even appeared in the Society’s original proposal. That proposal,
written when the Society’s organizational form was still inchoate, stated,
“As its statement of purpose indicates, the Federalist Society is being
founded in no small measure to advance such concepts as judicial restraint
and the rule of law. In order to effectively achieve that goal it may be
helpful for the Federalist Society to submit amicus curiae briefs in appropriate
cases.”50 Interest in the idea increased in 1985, an indication of
which is a letter from Irving Kristol to Eugene Meyer observing, “I am
not a lawyer and really have no opinion about a pro bono litigation center
or lawyers groups—but, in the abstract, the prospect pleases.”51 This letter
appears to have been in response to a memo written that year suggesting
projects for the litigation center, including “locating appropriate
cases,” “conducting litigation projects,” and “participating in think-tank
seminars.” It notes that “we expect to be able to raise initial grants from
foundations who have given money to the Federalist Society. Senator
Hatch has indicated enthusiasm for the project and will assist in fundraising
for the Center.” It proposed that the center incorporate in November
1986, hire a staffer by April 1986, and begin selecting cases soon thereafter.52
Finally, there is a 1986 “Status Report”53 that notes, “The Federalist
Society has available today a $75,000 grant from the Scaife Foundation,
the terms of which would permit expenditures toward initial funding of
the Litigation Center.” In addition, the Society’s files include plans for a
conference designed to produce a “compendium of ideas for use by Federalist
Society Litigation Center.”54 Pointing to the findings of the Horowitz
Report—another sign of the report’s importance to the conservative
movement—the memo noted the disappointing results of existing conservative
firms. “Although the movement’s success has received mixed reviews,
it has clearly not achieved the widespread conservative shift in legal
policy that was originally intended.” Society members have somewhat
different recollections of how seriously the litigation center was consid-
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 155

ered. Gary Lawson, a longtime member of the Federalist Society’s board
of directors, recalls, “We pretty quickly put the kibosh on it on the theory
that it would compromise the mission too much. . . . My recollection is
that . . . there was some foundation that expressed interest in six-figure
funding of a litigation group. So we had to consider it.” On the other
hand, both Otis and McIntosh believe that the proposal was considered
quite seriously. Otis states,

I think we did think about it reasonably seriously, and I remember what happened
in my mind was at a certain point I realized [that] if we do this we are
going to be filing briefs, and there [will] have to be the Federalist Society’s name
on it, and people are going to want us to take a position. . . . You have different
schools of thought. [We have members who] would really like the takings clause
to reach certain kinds of government regulation . . . and then we have other
people in the organization who feel strongly that it’s not the case. And so officially
the brief is going to have to say one thing or the other, and [as a result]
there were going to [be] people who are going to be really mad, and then what?
I remember fairly clearly going through that thought process and thinking . . .
we’re going to have to kill this thing.

David McIntosh adds that the opportunity costs of starting a litigation
center were a significant factor, given that the Society was just getting off
the ground.

The energy to make something like that work was a lot more than we had
anticipated and therefore we’d have to make some explicit choices. Do we
want to now spend a lot of our time and effort and resources in developing a
litigation project at a point when there existed other conservative litigation
entities? And it would take away and diminish our abilities in the programming
we were doing on campuses, starting the lawyers chapters. . . . It forced
a choice of where you put your resources in an organization, and we went to
the core strengths.

A litigation center could have also jeopardized the participation of many
of the Society’s members, especially those in government. Suggestive in
this regard is a 1985 letter from a senior Reagan administration official
noting that he would have to resign from the organization if it pursued
such an initiative.55
As a partial substitute for a litigation center, the Society created, in the
mid-1990s, a pro bono law clearinghouse to connect conservative and
libertarian lawyers with ideologically sympathetic pro bono opportunities.
The initiative was initially modest and poorly funded, but the Society
has recently increased its ambitions in the area considerably through the
creation of the Federalist Society Pro Bono Populi Center, funded largely
by a grant from the Brady Foundation. The Society’s increased focus on
156 CHAPTER 5

pro bono law was driven by interest from its members, who “complained
a lot about the kind of pro bono activities that are available. If you’re
going to do pro bono work you want to do something you feel strongly
about, and they didn’t feel they were getting as much of that as they’d
like.”56 The question was whether it was possible to reconcile the Society’s
desire to be responsive to its members with its mission to facilitate debate.
The creation of the passive matching system has allowed them to do so.
Using a computer matching system, the Society connects members with
organizations who have submitted cases without taking any role in case
selection, a point strongly emphasized in the project’s grant proposal.
“Because the Society will not screen participants, it makes no representations
regarding the qualifications or legal experience of particular lawyers
involved. All we do is encourage the initial contact.” Furthermore, the
proposal noted that “furnishing information to public interest groups
should not be construed as the Society’s endorsement of either the group
or the specific project involved.”57 While this project is somewhat at odds
with the Society’s primary mission of fostering debate, it fits well with its
increasing role of countering what it sees as the influence of the liberal
legal network on the organized bar (discussed in greater detail below in
the section “A Counter-ABA?”).
The Society saw the project as an opportunity to correct a significant
imbalance between liberal and conservative public interest law. Just as
the Federalist Society has accused the ABA of being ideologically biased,
it has recently claimed that pro bono law in major firms is systematically
diverting valuable resources to legal liberals, while providing almost nothing
to lawyers on the right.58 Chapter 2 provides some support for this
argument, since it shows that the liberal legal network has thousands of
lawyers willing and able to handle public interest law cases, fed through
the pro bono system and trained in law school clinics. Despite all their
other strengths, conservatives continue to have little of this sort of infrastructure,
and as a result conservative law firms only have the manpower
to take cases likely to set a significant precedent. The need to correct this
“disparity between these two philosophical sides in the number of lawyers
who follow up on victories made by the public interest groups with whom
they agree”59 was the most important motivation for the Society’s expansion
of its involvement in pro bono law. By matching lawyers in its network
with interesting but non-precedent-setting cases, the Society told its
patrons that “lawyers will work thousands of extra pro bono hours in
these cases, thereby dramatically expanding the ability of our public interest
groups to defend the Constitution and promote free enterprise by connecting
them with a new generation of volunteers.”60 This project is probably
the farthest the Society has strayed from its mission of fostering
debate to actively organizing conservatives for political and legal activ-
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 157

ism. The Society has gambled that it has created a means by which it can
support conservative pro bono law while respecting its carefully policed
organizational boundaries.
No conviction about the Federalist Society is as tenacious as the belief
that it plays a key role in Republican administrations’ selection of federal
judges, especially since the Bush administration limited the role of the
ABA. This is another area where the distinction between the Society as
an organization and as a network is essential. The Society has considered
issuing its own ratings of judges, in response to pressure from members.
An early memo61 describes a proposal for “Recommendation and Evaluation
of Judges,” in which the Society would “develop recommendations
for appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for all circuits.... Each
recommendation will be accompanied with a short statement about the
candidate, his record, and his strengths and weaknesses.”62 The memo
also suggested that the Society “make every effort to contribute to the
examination of potential judicial appointments whom we hear about before
their actual appointments.” The memo makes it very clear why the
Society considered such a project:

Judicial candidates are perhaps less thoroughly examined than most candidates
for public office. This is true both with regard to their judicial philosophy and
the intellectual caliber of their thought and writing. Their integrity usually receives
exemplary review; but integrity alone is not enough. The Reagan administration
provides an example of the importance of such review. While most of
its judicial appointments have been excellent, a few have shared the philosophy
and judicially activist orientation of many of the Carter appointees. There are
many reasons for these appointments, but we hope that our evaluation of judges
will contribute usefully to the store of knowledge from which judicial appointments
are made.

In the absence of a mechanism to systematically determine the judicial
philosophy of nominees to the bench, the memo assumes that Republican
administrations would fail to nominate reliably conservative judges. Outside
government, but with a formidable network of “its own advisory
board, its recent graduates, and law professors, lawyers and law students
with whom the society has had contact and who share the society’s basic
purposes,” the Society would have access to information on the judicial
philosophy of potential nominees inaccessible to government officials.
Meyer recalls that Society volunteers “keep saying, ‘We think the ABA
is biased in the way it does judges; we need something to counter, to show
that there is an alternative.’ And they say that the Federalist Society is the
natural thing to do that.” The proposal was never acted upon, because
of doubts about the effectiveness of such ratings: “How seriously would
such ratings be taken? What’s our qualification for doing it? It’s a large
158 CHAPTER 5

logistical [project]. The fact of the matter is how it would be perceived.”
Despite the ambition of some members that the Society act as counter
to the ABA, it lacks the dispassionate, neutral professional reputation
necessary for effectively rating federal judges. The Society has the power
to vigorously challenge the reputation of the ABA—which it has done
successfully enough that the Bush administration ceased cooperating with
ABA review of judicial nominees—but it has not been able to reform the
ABA or provide a viable alternative to it.
While the proposal to rate federal judges was rejected, formal involvement
in judicial selection may have been rendered unnecessary by the
growth of the Society’s network. First, Society members have assumed
important positions in the judicial nomination process. Steven Markman,
who as assistant attorney general in Reagan’s second term was
responsible for judicial nominations, suggests that the Society network
helped to identify and expand the pool of potential conservative nominees
for the bench.

When you look early in the Reagan administration in the first term, sure, everybody
knows that Professor Scalia at the University of Chicago or Professor Bork
at Yale shared this approach to the judicial role, but it was not a deep team at
that point, and . . . the Federalist Society really did help to not only identify
additional [candidates], but . . . it also helped to create more individuals who
found these views attractive. Once you get past people like Professor Easterbrook,
and Professor Bork, and Professor Scalia, there was a lot of confusion
as to the other appellate court nominees, and District Court nominees as well,
and I think the Federalist Society helped to identify, to track, people who proved
to be . . . capable of filling those positions.

Lee Liberman Otis, who in the first Bush administration directed the
White House Counsel’s work on judicial nominations, argues that the
Society dramatically improved the quantity and reliability of information
in the hands of conservatives involved in judicial nominations. The Society
had “[a] lot of people who were sympathetic to what we were trying
to do on the courts whom one could call and ask for thoughts about
various candidates, or for thoughts on candidates that would make good
judges. . . . It was a source of information in both directions, both positive
and negative.”
Republicans also have used Society membership as a criterion in making
executive branch appointments. A former official in the George W.
Bush administration recalls that

Precisely because the law schools and legal establishment are so liberal, membership
and especially leadership in the Federalist Society is a costly signal of
commitment to legal conservatism, and so as a result it is also a valuable signal.
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 159

So, if someone is willing to stick their neck out to be a member of the Federalist
Society, then they can be counted on to have some commitment to conservative
legal ideas and the conservative movement that someone else does not, say a
local Republican Party hack. When I was hiring at [an executive agency], we
would not only look for whether someone was in the Federalist Society but
whether he or she actually attended monthly Federalist Society lunches or were
at Ted Olson’s annual barbecue, signs that they were willing to bear a cost for
the signal.63

Like the D.C. chapter’s role in the diffusion of information within the
federal government, the Federalist Society’s network reduces the transaction
costs of acquiring information about the quality and ideological preferences
of potential nominees to the federal bench and executive branch.
This networking effect, combined with the presence of active Society
members in senior positions in Republican administrations, is much more
important in the selection of personnel than any active role the organization
plays as an organization. Meyer concludes, “If we have succeeded in
the ideas part . . . and people have come to share ideas, and . . . get to
know each other, we’re not irrelevant to what they end up doing. I
wouldn’t go farther than that, but I would go that far.”
While the informal role of Society members and networks is surely its
most important role in judicial selection, the Society has increased its
formal role over the last few years, and this has required careful attention
to boundary maintenance. Starting with the Roberts nomination,
the Society did become more involved in the debate over judicial confirmations,
but in a way that maintained its short-term institutional neutrality.
Meyer describes the new role for the Society as primarily about
enabling public education:

[In the Society] there a bunch of people who are... experts in [the role of the
courts] and clerked on the Court and have constitutional law expertise, [and]
they really would be people who should be out there talking to the media. [So],
one, we were making them available, and number two, we’ve gotten some PR
help to make them available. Our feeling is that the role of the Court is one of
the central things that we talk about, and it will facilitate the public discussion
a lot to get some of these people out there. So we are doing [this] as an organization
not in the sense that these people are representative of our organization,
but in the sense that we’re very much trying to get these people out into the
media so [the most eloquent views on the subject] get heard. But beyond that,
we as an organization don’t do anything.

This strategy is reminiscent of how the Society has managed its role in
pro bono law. In pro bono law, it wanted to increase the contribution of
Society members to conservative public interest law firms, while in judi-
160 CHAPTER 5

cial selection it sought to shape the debate over Republican nominees
to the bench by increasing the availability and quality of conservative
commentators available to the news media. In neither case was the Society
“neutral”: it wanted to increase the effectiveness of conservative public
interest law and the success rate of conservative nominees to the federal
bench. In both cases, however, the Society sought to avoid involving itself
in a way that would lead to conflict with its members, who might disagree
with any particular case brought by a public interest law firm, or with
specific judicial nominees. As a result, the Society has fallen back on its
role as a network entrepreneur, facilitating the participation of its members
and in the process increasing the impact of the rest of the conservative
legal movement.
While the Society has limited its formal role in judicial confirmations,
its task of projecting its organizational neutrality has been complicated
by the increasing involvement of Leonard Leo, the Society’s executive
vice president and director of its Lawyers Division. Along with Ed Meese
and Jay Sekulow,64 Leo closely advised the White House in the choice of
John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and, more controversially, Harriet Miers.65
Leo had previously been involved in partisan politics as the head of Catholic
Outreach for the Republican National Committee, but his deepening
involvement in judicial confirmations in Bush’s second term led him to
take a leave of absence from the Society, since that deeper role has made
it “hard[er] to separate him from the organization.”66 While the Society
was eager to distinguish its formal involvement in the Roberts nomination
from that of Leo’s more direct role, the nearly unanimous support
Roberts received from Society members meant that tension or confusion
was unlikely. The Miers nomination was entirely different, as her strongest
opponents were Society members such as Robert Bork, Randy Barnett,
and John Yoo. The tension between Leo’s role in the Society and
his support for the Miers nomination came to a boil with the publication
of a long Wall Street Journal article. The article reported that “Roger
Pilon, vice president for legal affairs at the Cato Institute, a libertarian
think tank, was fuming in his Washington office when the Miers nomination
was announced. When he saw Mr. Leo on television, defending the
nominee and identified as a Federalist Society officer, Mr. Pilon picked
up the telephone and complained to the society’s president, Eugene
Meyer. Mr. Meyer had already called the television network to complain,
both men recall.”67 Meyer is quick to point out that all of his members
understood, when it was explained to them, that Leo’s role was in his
own personal capacity and that he took a leave of absence precisely to
avoid making it seem as if the Society was actively supporting the administration’s
judicial choices.
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 161

The very complications that Leo’s role in judicial confirmations has
created for the Society is a sign of the importance of its boundaries and
the consequences of an apparent breach. As McIntosh observes, “My
view—and I am the most politically oriented in the board—is [that] once
you cross that Rubicon [of active involvement in judicial confirmation],
the nature of the organization changes, and so we have to remain disciplined
and say, ‘No, we’re going to participate, but we have a larger function
of making sure these ideas are debated in the legal culture.’ ” David
McIntosh recalls that deciding precisely where the activities of the Society
in judicial nominations should end and where that of its members should
begin was a major subject of debate within the Society’s leadership.

Now a step over the line which we . . . consciously have decided not to do in
the organization would be having a group . . . geared to support a particular
nomination, a particular process for that nomination. And again it came down
to wanting to be faithful to not taking positions. It requires discipline—let’s put
it that way—because you’ve got members who are interested in engaging more
fully in the political process of a confirmation. You’ve got political entities that
look to the Federalist Society favorably who say, “Can you guys participate?”
And we say, “No, our mission is limited to this.”

The Society clearly is “political” and partisan in one sense, in that it seeks
to advance legal goals with strong support in the Republican Party and
little support among Democrats and to increase the effectiveness of conservative
organizational entrepreneurs whose activities are largely consistent
with those of the Republican Party. As the Miers nomination shows,
however, the Society’s network is also capable of disciplining party leaders
when they are seen as going soft on conservative legal principles for shortterm
or personal political reasons. This disciplining function does not
mean that the Society is set apart from the party system; in a system in
which parties have become defined by ideology, this is a critical mechanism
through which elected officials are held responsible to the party’s
elite strata.
How did the Society maintain such a clear, consistent, and limited mission
over time? Much of the explanation has to do with its remarkably
stable leadership cadre. Of the six members of the Society’s board of directors,
Steven Calabresi, David McIntosh, Gary Lawson, and Eugene Meyer
have led the Society from its inception, while Brent Hatch and Kenneth
Cribb became active in the leadership of the Society soon thereafter. The
Society has had only one full-time president, Eugene Meyer, and the cochairmen
of the Society’s Board of Visitors, Robert Bork and Orrin
Hatch, have had some relationship with the Society from its inception.
This consistency of leadership is no accident, as vacancies on the board
of directors are filled by the board itself, a decision that emerged early
162 CHAPTER 5

in the Society’s development. The July 31, 1982, organizational meeting
minutes indicate a decision that “the Board of Directors will be self-perpetuating
and will be comprised of students and lawyers. . . .” Interestingly,
that sentence originally was concluded with “each serving a one or
two year term.”68 Had this become official Society policy, it would have
eliminated the continuity of leadership that has allowed the Society to
manage its organizational boundaries and protected the Society against
short-term pressures for expansion. As Gary Lawson explains,

The reason we’ve succeeded . . . is that the same people who ran it twenty
years ago, and the same people who will run it twenty years from now . . . all
have a very clear vision of what this organization should do, which is promote
ideas. Bring debates into the law schools, bring debates into the legal community,
and everything else that happens, we’ll take it. . . . If you ever view this
as a device for organizing and galvanizing or anything else, it will blow up,
and we all know that, and we’re not going to let that happen. . . . If anybody
wants to try to move the focus of this organization . . . they’re going to run
into a brick wall immediately.

This stability of mission and personnel would not be surprising for
most contemporary political organizations, but the Federalist Society is
not a nonparticipatory “association without members.”69 Quite to the
contrary, the Society’s strength comes from the direct participation of its
members. In this sort of participatory organization, leadership elections
might be thought essential, as they encourage member mobilization and
ensure leadership legitimacy.70 In the case of the Society, however, ideological
competition with legal liberalism substitutes for internal competition
among conservatives and weakens the virulence of intragroup ideological
conflict. In addition, the norm against “position taking” and the
focus on intellectual debate reduces the need for ideological factions to
mobilize to protect their position. That said, it might have been expected
that as the Society grew from a small group of friends to a large, less
intensely connected group, the legitimacy of its tight leadership cadre
would come under suspicion, as was the pattern for many participatory
groups of the Left.71 Conservatives, however, may be more willing to
judge the legitimacy of leadership by the fruits of their labor; so long as
the Society seems to be working, they see no reason to challenge its authority
structure. Finally, while the Society’s national office prepares lists
of funded speakers, the chapters themselves choose whom to invite, who
their leaders will be, and what activities they will engage in. These factors,
taken together, explain how the Society has been able to maintain
the high level of participation that is necessary to its core networking
mission, while simultaneously preserving a stable leadership cadre that
can maintain the organization’s boundaries.
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 163

Organizational Outputs: Direct and Indirect

As was hinted at before, to understand the Federalist Society requires
close attention to the distinction between its direct and indirect outputs.
The most significant direct output is debate: over half of the organization’s
funding goes to sponsoring speakers and its national meetings.72
The indirect outputs of the Society network are best understood as the
conservative movement’s return on the social capital produced by the Society’s
debating activities.73 None of the Society’s effects on the politics of
judicial nominations, networking, placement of members, or facilitating
connections across government is denied or foresworn by its leaders. That
said, the Society could never have produced these effects had it pursued
them directly. By limiting its programming, and thereby nurturing a reputation
for intellectual seriousness and distance from short-term partisan
politics, the Society has, perhaps paradoxically, been more effective in
serving the political goals of its allies than a more directly partisan organization
ever could have been.
The orientation to debate discussed above (see “Building Chapters”)
was not the only model available to the founders of the Society. When
it was created, the other model, especially for campus organizing, was
represented by the Dartmouth Review. Calabresi argues that

we’ve tried to remain in dialogue with the organizations we’re trying to compete
with on the left. One thing we very much did not want to do when we started
going was turn into another Dartmouth Review. We thought that the Dartmouth
Review was a forum where conservatives got together and had fun by
acting like caricatures of themselves and taking all sorts of extreme positions
and making themselves the objects of hatred and alienated everybody. We
wanted to be engaged in constructive dialogue with liberal institutions. The
underlying premise of the Federalist Society was that if we could just get liberals
to think about and talk about our ideas enough, we might persuade them that
we’re right. So we want to be a reasonable organization like AEI, an organization
of thoughtful and intelligent people, an organization that’s engaged in dialogue
with people on the left, not an organization that’s a caricature of what
conservatives could be. That’s colored us with the ABA; it’s been the case with
law schools, with law firms. We’ve always attempted to be in dialogue with the
organizations that we’re competing with, in part because we hope to influence
them to some extent.

The rejected Dartmouth Review style of conservative organization was
outrageous, attention-grabbing, and ideologically extreme. Former Review
editor Dinesh D’Souza claims that the Review’s strategic insight was
that “by staking out a kind of far-right position, the Review has legiti-
164 CHAPTER 5

mated a wide range of positions in the middle.”74 Reminiscent of the strategies
of the far Left in the 1960s, by baiting liberal institutions to censor
it, the Review sought to uncover their concealed ideological bias and inherent
repressiveness. This repression would repel students from the Left,
and the Review, by stretching the ideological range far to the right, would
tend to pull the center along with it. Despite the Review’s visibility in
the early 1980s, the Society’s founders rejected this approach. Federalist
Society members are regularly reminded by their leaders to be cordial and
well mannered with their ideological opponents. While this is driven in
part by what the Society’s leaders consider appropriate, it is also informed
by the assumption that ideology has a personal component, that people
are initially attracted to or repelled by the character of an ideological
movement’s representatives rather than their ideas. The Society’s strategy
was, therefore, to generate for legal conservatism a reputation as more
rational, open-minded, intellectual, and idealistic than its opposition, and
as a result to attract individuals who share these temperamental characteristics,
even if they were, like much of the Society’s leadership in an earlier
ideological phase, vaguely liberal.
This emphasis on intellectual debate is, again perhaps paradoxically,
the key to the Society’s ability to fulfill its more directly political goals.
Calabresi argues that the Society was designed to be a “conservative university
without walls,” recognizing the critical political functions produced
by modern higher education.

We’ve tried to replicate the function that major universities serve on the left of

creating a community of people with similar views on similar issues. We’ve
tried to do that by holding debates and meetings, particularly panel discussions.
We’ve definitively tried to keep the organization more of an intellectual organization,
as an organization that debates ideas, puts people in touch with each
other, and forms friendships, networks of friends, rather than crossing over the
line of actually lobbying for a bill in Congress, or taking a position in an amicus
brief before the Supreme Court.

Gary Lawson argues something similar, noting that “the mere fact of having
a gathering place, a place where people can, twice a year on the national
level and however many times on the local level, gather, of course
has that consequence. That’s not something we ever tried to stop or stifle.
It’s always a by-product, an incidental consequence of ‘at last there is a
conservative legal organization out there.’ ” Calabresi takes a somewhat
less passive approach than Lawson to the indirect effects of the organization,
emphasizing the network-building functions of the Society’s formal
activities, and also suggesting that these were intended, and not just desirable
unintended consequences. One important goal of the Society was
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 165

letting conservatives know who’s out there in the conservative movement, so
you build up networks of friends and associates who are all on the conservative
side of things. The hope is that people will collaborate on projects on conservatism
and law in the future, but that collaboration will only get started if the
friendships are there and if people know who’s out there in the conservative
community. Basically the situation we face is that at any given law school there
may be ten or fifteen conservatives, and they may know each other but they
wouldn’t know other conservatives at other schools but for the existence of
something like the Federalist Society. Similarly conservative lawyers are scattered
all across the country, but there may be only one or two or three in any
given firm. By having an organization like the Federalist Society you bring all
those people together, they form friendships, they start working together, they
start collaborating on things, and before you know it you have a powerful network
of people who are working on programs of social change. Basically one
thing we concluded was that the Left had very powerful networks of Harvard
and Yale Law School, or past Supreme Court clerks who tended to be liberal,
and those networks on the left tended to be very effective . . . at influencing
legal developments in a liberal direction. . . . So hopefully what we’ve done is
create a major network on the right of people who like to talk about law, talk
about legal issues, who will get together and act on legal issues. And it’s all very
decentralized—they’re not acting according to a program.... They [Society
members] tend to be libertarians or social conservatives and they will naturally
tend to collaborate with each other on conservative legal developments.

Networking versus intellectual engagement may be a false dichotomy,
since the Society is, first and foremost, a network cemented by intellectual
and philosophical commitment. The Society’s assumption has been that
serious intellectual stimulation and opportunities to meet other legal conservatives
will generate strong bonds of friendship. Once these activities
are in place, the Society networks do not need any direction from the
center.75 By increasing the probability that conservative lawyers will interact
with others of similar views and interests, the Society helps members
share ideas, provide tips on opportunities for activism, and share leads
on employment.76 Through repeated contact with other conservatives, the
Society’s networks reinforce ideological commitment, transform general
attitudes into well-formed philosophical commitments, and as a consequence
make members more willing to defend their views publicly.77
The Society’s networks also increase the willingness of members to be
open about their identity as conservatives.78 Many of the Federalist Society
members I have spoken to refer to conservative lawyers as being “in
the closet,” and the comparison to homosexuals is quite instructive.79 The
Federalist Society tie, with its picture of James Madison, serves a similar
function to a pink triangle bumper sticker or lapel pin, signaling to those
166 CHAPTER 5

“in the closet” that their identity is not shameful and that there are others
out there like them. In the process, it helps transform what would otherwise
be a stigmatized identity into a badge of pride and in the process
creates a deep emotional attachment to the organization. This function
was, of course, more important in the Society’s early years. Gary Lawson
recalls,

People don’t understand what the law schools were like twenty years ago. It
was much more important to bring people out of the closet. We started with
six people at Yale. We were the six who would self-identify as anything other
than far left. Four traditional conservatives, one libertarian—me—and one classical
conservative, Hayekian. In terms of speaking up in class, that was basically
me, and the reason for that was that anyone who said anything out of the orthodoxy
would get hissed. Not only did the professors not do anything about it,
but some of them we strongly suspected were complicitous in that. Someone
like me, I reveled in it because I liked being the bad guy. It would be uncomfortable
for someone [else].

This account of the situation at Yale seems hyperbolic not because Lawson
is engaged in victim-mongering, or because Yale was a strange outlier—no
less a figure of the Left than Duncan Kennedy confirms that a
similar situation existed at Harvard Law School80—but because the Society
(in conjunction with changes in the larger culture) has been so effective
in shifting the tone in America’s elite law schools. As an early grant proposal
describes it, the purpose of the organization was to “reduce the
necessity of conforming. To be outside the liberal network will no longer
mean having to sacrifice all of the benefits. In days of conservative administrations,
our network will even be able to offer advantages that the other
cannot.”81 Solidarity and collective action would, the Society’s founders
hoped, encourage conservatives to show their ideological stripes.82
One important consequence of declining preference falsification among
conservatives has been an increasing willingness to pursue ideologically
driven pro bono work. Calabresi observes, “I’ve just kind of casually noticed
that significant numbers of Federalists who are out practicing . . . in
firms try to find conservative pro bono work, and I don’t remember that
going on to that degree twenty years ago.” Being embedded in a network
of fellow believers provides social support for taking on controversial
cases, helps lawyers identify sympathetic allies in their firm, and gets members’
names into circulation among those with relevant cases. By reducing
the stigma of legal conservatism and creating durable networks between
its members, the Federalist Society also reduces search costs for conservative
litigation organizations. As Chip Mellor, the president of the Institute
for Justice argues, the Federalist Society “attracts a wonderful array of
talent, bright and committed conservative and libertarian lawyers who
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 167

are looking to apply their philosophy through their legal training in some
fashion. All of them have a certain awareness of the kinds of issues that
we deal with. They’re a tremendous talent pool that’s out there ready to
be mobilized in some fashion.” One clear example of the importance of
the Society’s role in reducing the transaction costs of identifying conservatives
is the Institute for Justice’s recent move to create state-level chapters.
Mellor observes that, in deciding where IJ should set up state chapters,83
the critical factors are “a viable conservative and libertarian state think
tank, constitutional provisions that are not gutted in terms of their potential
for advancing liberty, a strong Federalist Society presence, a mediumsized
state with both a nonpoliticized and a noncorrupt judiciary.” The
Federalist Society provides public goods for organizational entrepreneurs
like IJ, goods that are vital given that identifying conservative lawyers
is an expensive and time-consuming task that serves the interests of all
conservative organizations but would not be cost effective for any of them
to produce on their own.84

A Counter-ABA?

From early in its history, the Federalist Society has had to decide how it
should relate to the grandfather of all legal organizations, the American
Bar Association. While the Society made some efforts to influence the
ABA directly, this approach was almost wholly ineffective. The Society
has chosen instead to harshly and repeatedly criticize the ABA, damaging
its legitimacy as the representative of the legal profession, and added
activities that replicate some of the professional bar’s functions, such as
networking and professional development. Driven by the Society leadership’s
personal anger at the defeat of the Bork nomination, this
“counter-ABA” strategy has become an increasingly central part of the
organization’s mission.
It has always been an article of faith within the Federalist Society that,
as its 1983 proposal put it, “Under the guise of nonpartisan and even
non-controversial law reform proposals, both the state bar associations
and the ABA have played crucial roles in developing a legal agenda which
sometimes strangles dissent.”85 In its early “Three Year Plan,” the Society
set out as a key goal of its newly created Lawyers Division to

bring together and coordinate conservative activity within the ABA. This will
involve using the ABA national, state and city conventions as both a recruiting
ground and a platform. . . . [We should] determine which sections of the ABA
our members are involved in. We will concentrate our activities in one or two of
these sections. In the long term, making conservatives from around the country
168 CHAPTER 5

aware of each other’s existence and encouraging them to become active in a
section of the ABA where they can help tip the balance of power will be a means
through which we will improve the ideological balance in the ABA.86

As early as 1984, the Society’s leaders recognized that this strategy of
infiltration for ideological balancing was insufficient.

In addition to activities within the ABA, we will pull together conservative lawyers
outside the ABA and use the Federalist Society as a national conservative
legal organization which would do on a smaller scale many of the things the
ABA does, such as pronouncements or ratings concerning appointments to legal
positions or comments on developments affecting the law. At present most
Americans and even many knowledgeable observers think the ABA is conservative
itself. This way at least some other legal organizations could be quoted to
show that the ABA’s view that “we have to take the Meese nomination headon”
is not the only legal viewpoint.87

The “many knowledgeable observers” that the Society referred to in this
document even included the conservative foundations that were funding
the organization. In a 1984 letter (which may have sparked the comment
above), Thomas Main, a program officer at the Smith Richardson Foundation,
remarked, “In your last letter, you claim the ABA has a liberal
bias, which I found rather surprising. I had been under the impression that
the ABA is a relatively conservative organization. I would like evidence of
this bias.”88 Before the Society could make the case for becoming a
“counter-ABA,” it had to convince the conservative movement that a need
existed in the first place.
The Society’s relationship to the ABA combined revealing the ABA’s
ideological character with using that revelation to inject competition into
the market for representing the profession. The latter objective is evidenced
in a grant proposal from 1985, which predicted that “the very
existence of an organization with some reputation for scholarliness which
expressed alternative views would help undermine the influence exercised
by the organized bar on the legal and political communities. It would
undercut the bar associations’ monopoly on respectability and provide a
vehicle for publicizing the partisan nature of much of their work.”89 The
Society thought that this approach would be especially influential on
those outside of the conservative movement. Consider this passage from
the first issue of the Society’s ABA Watch:

One of the most disturbing social trends of the last two decades has the growing

politicization of institutions that were once praised for being impartial and

“above politics.” One by one, leading American institutions, from our courts,
to the academy, to the media, have become vehicles for achieving political objectives.
This trend is no doubt alarming to many members of the legal commu-
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 169

nity. . . . For decades, public officials have generally believed that the organization
is objective and apolitical. To this day, on matters involving legal policy
and appointments to the bench, the ABA receives the utmost deference from
most legislators.90

Many issues of ABA Watch have bemoaned the “liberal bias” in ABA
activities, from its amicus briefs in such cases as Grutter v. Bollinger to
its ratings of federal judicial nominees. The Society’s core argument, however,
is that having any principled position is inappropriate for a professional
organization intended to represent a wide range of members. The
Federalist Society has staked out a rhetorical position in favor of “neutrality,”
no doubt knowing that any kind of rigorously applied neutrality
would require a dramatic restriction of the ABA’s mission. The Society
has taken advantage of a bind that the ABA, and to a degree all professional
organizations, face. While the idea of professional neutrality has
entered into terminal decline, the ABA’s justification for its existence presumes
that such a neutral role can exist. This bind has provided a very
effective opening for the Society’s attacks on the organization.
The drive to turn the Federalist Society into a counter-ABA picked up
momentum after the defeat of the Bork nomination in 1987. Calabresi
believes the nomination injected a powerful emotional charge into the
organization, rooted in the close personal connection that Bork had
forged with the group.91

It was tremendously energizing for conservatives, having a martyr, basically.
That’s the only way of describing it.... Bork was a person who forged extremely
deep friendships with a large number of people. He had been an active
spokesman for thirty years before his nomination, he’d been around for a long
time, he knew all the leading conservatives in the conservative legal movement.
We [had] been his students or his law clerks, or worked with him in the SGs
office, been colleagues of his when he was a judge.... People felt a tremendous
loyalty to him; he was one of these unusual people who inspires a real loyalty,
one that I feel today. In fact I named my oldest son Robert, I’m sure because of
my admiration for him.... People didn’t set about to make Bork a martyr
because it would be politically useful to the conservative cause to have a martyr.
People genuinely felt outraged. They felt the way if their father or mother had
not been confirmed to the Supreme Court, or some close personal friend. There
were a lot of people who felt this way and nursed their sense of grievance, and
it became a martyrdom situation.

That sense of martyrdom translated into a powerful motivation to use the
Society to get revenge on the liberal legal elites who were seen as responsible
for Bork’s defeat. While the organization has continued to conduct its
intellectual activities, Calabresi believes it has given an impetus to the
counter-ABA functions of the Society:
170 CHAPTER 5

I think one question that we struggled with in the mid- to late eighties was what
direction our lawyer’s division should go in, whether we should try to be a
conservative alternative to the ABA. I think the Bork nomination failure pushed
us [in that direction], forming practice groups in various areas where practitioners
in communications law or administrative law could get together and
talk about their fields, basically trying to increase our membership so that it
was closer to the size of the ABA. I think we became much more interested in
being a conservative alternative to the ABA after the Bork fight in part because
one of the key things in the Bork fight was that the ABA committee split on
giving Bork a well-qualified rating for the Supreme Court. Four or five members
of the ABA review committee said he was not qualified or that he was only
qualified, not well qualified, so the ABA was seen as playing a role in Bork’s
defeat. That made us want to be more of a conservative alternative to the ABA.
In that sense we became more political than we had been before the Bork confirmation
fight, because before that we did not have so concretely the goal of
being a conservative alternative to the ABA. After the Bork fight we did to a
greater extent.

Most social movements have a seminal moment of injustice that motivates
their members to greater exertions: homosexuals remember Stonewall,
blacks images of John Lewis being beaten in Rock Hill, feminists
the Clarence Thomas hearings. These moments of injustice serve essential
organizational functions. They are often ritualized and remembered,
nursed as grievances and used as motivation for extracting extra effort
from group members. They can also, as in the case of the Bork nomination,
serve as catalysts for organizational change and the intensification
of effort. Before the nomination, the organization’s budget had leveled
off. In the four years after it, the Society’s budget doubled, in large part
due to the “Bork effect.” A Development Planning Meeting memo from
October 1990 notes, “A special appeal to the Federalist Society mailing
list signed by Judge Bork has been the most successful ever. Receipts total
$17,250 and are matchable. Another grant of $10,000 from the Foundation
for American Studies came in after receiving this letter.”92 Other fundraising
memos mention the importance of Bork’s support to the Society’s
fund-raising efforts.93
In addition to the growth of the Society’s Lawyers Division, the most
important institutional shift in the organization since the Bork nomination
has been the addition of the Society’s practice groups. The Society
currently operates fifteen practice groups, examining subjects from administrative
law to telecommunications,94 roughly the same set of topics
that the Society began with in 1995. In contrast to the lawyer and student
chapters, the practice groups were the result of planning rather than gradual
evolution, driven by the Society’s reaction to, and attempt to partially
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 171

substitute for, the ABA’s “Sections.” The original proposal to the E. L.
Wiegand Foundation, which funded the practice groups’ start-up costs,
makes the motivations for the practice groups clear, and shows that the
Society’s criticism of the ABA is not simply a rhetorical ploy, but is sincerely
believed by its leaders. The objectives of the practice groups were
the following:

1. To develop a mechanism by which like-minded lawyers with practices in
particular areas can meet to exchange ideas. Existing groups that try to
bring lawyers together on the basis of their work in specific areas of law—
i.e., the organized bar—almost never focus on topics that are of importance
to lawyers interested in traditional legal values. . . . It is no surprise,
therefore, that a significant number of talented attorneys will not (and
perhaps cannot) use meetings of the ABA and other existing bar groups
to seek out lawyers who share their principles.
2. To facilitate a more in-depth analysis of how traditional legal principles
should inform judgments in particularized or specialized areas of legal
practice. . . . The organized bar has no apparent interest in such ideas—
even at the simple level of raising them through debate—and it is therefore
very difficult to use existing institutions as a springboard for serious
discussion.
3. To create and bring together networks of lawyers in major areas of legal
practice who, through projects of mutual interest, can counterbalance
negative trends that are developing due to government action, judicial
overreaching, or leftward pressures by the organized bar. The leadership
of the organized bar is, by and large, captured by the Left. Consequently,
there are limits to how much leadership those interested in traditional
legal principles are able to assert through the organized bar.95

The practice groups reflected the frustration of the Society’s members
with the ABA’s perceived blending of professional status with an ideologically
motivated agenda, and the hope that by reflecting the ABA’s structure
on the right the Society could perform for conservatives the same
functions that were performed for those on the left by the ABA. In replicating
the structure of the ABA’s organized sections, the Society has also
duplicated many of its functions. The practice groups organize panels at
the Society’s annual meetings, operate subcommittees for the discussion
of more specific areas of law, maintain websites that keep members upto-date
on new cases in their area of interest, publish newsletters that
provide a forum for the groups’ most active members to disseminate their
ideas, direct members to new articles and books within the ideological
umbrella of the organization, and publish transcripts of practice group
panels. The Society also believed that by providing continuing legal education
opportunities for practice group members, the new division would
172 CHAPTER 5

“attract attorneys who might not otherwise be exposed to our activities,”96
since they could justify to their firms devoting their time to Federalist
Society projects in their specific areas of interest that they could not
with its more purely intellectual debates.
These conferences, which are held across the country, also help to create
a stronger national network of conservative attorneys interested in specific
areas of law, by giving them the opportunity to create personal connections
along functional lines. In the Society’s view, the practice groups
are designed to link

leading practitioners to one another, as well as to public policy leaders. Practice
Groups . . . facilitate networks that enable lawyer members to become active
in the issues that matter most to them—issues where they can have an impact....A
number of Practice Groups are establishing pro-bono networks that
connect lawyers with opportunities for pro-bono service in their practice areas.
The Criminal Law group, Environmental Law and Property Rights group, and
the Free Speech group have all initiated these valuable referral networks.97

The practice groups represent the Society’s effort to organize functionally
as well as geographically, in order to facilitate more active, policy-relevant
interactions between members, and to allow for a more intensive form of
involvement with the Society than is available in the Lawyers Division.
An example of the sort of interaction that the Society was looking for is
indicated by an instance where “on their own initiative and behalf, several
members of the Administrative Law group responded to a request by the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee to review draft legislation, culminating
in the completion of a memorandum to Committee staff.”98 In
addition, the practice groups’ newsletters and white papers fill the middlerange
void between the work of legal scholars and the typically nonstrategic
activities of lawyers in private practice.
The work of the Society’s practice groups is the closest it has gotten
to active involvement in public policy. Even here the group maintenance
imperative still exists, in the insistence that members are involved “on
their own initiative and behalf,” without the imprimatur of the Society
itself. When the practice groups were created, there was substantial concern
that they would cross the line into position-taking, and thus break
the organization’s boundaries. Lee Liberman Otis recalls, “I was nervous
that practice groups would really have trouble not taking positions....I
think what they end up doing is exchanging ideas of their areas of practice,
and serving as organizational mechanism for people to get to know
each other, who then if they want to go out and take positions together
and [pursue] cases, they know each other and they can do that.” Even
with the more ambitious set of activities associated with being a “counterABA,”
the Federalist Society is still a professional organization designed
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 173

to serve the interests of its members, albeit with an open appeal to one
part of the ideological spectrum. This concern for avoiding conflict explains
why, even though it has added counter-ABA functions to its original
mission of encouraging intellectual debate, the Society has focused on
facilitating rather than directing political, legislative, or litigation work.
Whatever reservations the officials of the Society may have about
its role as a counter-ABA after the Bork nomination, other members of
the conservative movement came to see it that way. Michael Greve, a
founder of the Center for Individual Rights, argues, “It’s actually a sort
of serious counterinstitution to the American Bar Institution.... It’s
nothing official. It’s just people know each other.... None of it is conspiratorial,
that’s just how the world works. Just as liberals have their own
institutions—they’re called universities, or the ABA—so conservatives
have theirs.”
The Federalist Society is still far from a true alternative to the ABA. It
has a small percentage of the ABA’s budget, a fraction of its membership,
and lacks the ABA’s structural role in the legal profession. That said, the
Society is clearly doing more for its members than operating as a debating
society. Its practice groups help conservatives develop alternative approaches
to law and public policy, and its Lawyers Division fosters social
networks that make conservative lawyers less dependent upon the mainstream
bar. It is increasing its role in helping conservative lawyers fulfill
their obligation to do pro bono work for conservative and libertarian
causes. It is not yet a complete alternative to the ABA, but it is closer to
fulfilling this function that it was fifteen years ago.

Back to the Law Schools

The Federalist Society began in the nation’s law schools, and while its
programming has expanded dramatically, it has never lost its focus on
legal education. At the top of the Society’s list of complaints with the legal
establishment has been the perceived exclusion of conservative faculty in
American law schools. For most of its quarter-century history, its response
remained at the level of critique, but over the last few years the Society
has sought to directly address the representation of conservatives in legal
education. The fortunes of this project are a useful prism through which
to evaluate the future of the Society and its effort to undermine the liberal
legal network.
In 1996, James Piereson of the Olin Foundation asked Eugene Meyer
whether there was anything that the Society could do to alter the ideological
balance of America’s law schools. Meyer spoke with Gary Lawson
of Boston University, who told Meyer that his one-year fellowship
174 CHAPTER 5

at Yale Law School was vital to his success in obtaining a teaching
job. The Olin Foundation had been operating its own fellowship program,
which provided funding for a year of leave for professors in a
wide range of disciplines (including law) prior to submitting their tenure
file. Meyer and Lawson’s idea was even more ambitious than this, since
it proposed using foundation support to improve the success of conservatives
at the front end of the hiring process, and not just at the back
end of the tenure process.
The market for potential law professors is quite different from that in
the arts and sciences. Whereas applicants for jobs in political science or
English can demonstrate their scholarly potential through their dissertations,
this is only possible for the minority of law teaching applications
with JD’s or PhD’s. A large number of applicants to the legal academy
take jobs in government or law firms before applying for teaching positions,
rather than going directly into teaching. As proof of scholarly impact
has become more important in law school hiring, the ability to get
time off to write before entering the legal academic market has become
increasingly important. A 1999 proposal for the Olin Fellows program
argued that the process by which time to write is allocated is biased toward
those on the left.99 “Fellowships do exist, but they are difficult to
obtain and usually are closely controlled by fairly senior professors who
share, even more than the average law school academic, the prevailing
left-wing orthodoxy that dominates the academy. Therefore, if these opportunities
are going to exist for students dedicated to principles of the
rule of law and limited government, a new fellowship program is necessary.”100
The proposal noted that the conservative movement had already
been successful in placing students in law and economics, but that in other
areas of law the conservative infrastructure was much more limited.

The few fellowships generally available to conservative students are in law and
economics. As a result, this has been the one area of law where conservative
scholars have had good opportunities—largely because of the excellent John
M. Olin Law and Economics programs that exist in many leading law schools.
Unfortunately, generally conservative perspectives in teaching are just as desperately
needed in most other legal subjects. In addition, there is some tendency
for any conservative teaching law to be pushed into law and economics. Therefore,
while there should be great pride in the build-up in that area, it is crucial
to reach into other parts of the legal academy as well.101

The Olin Fellows program represented a new stage in conservative
movement philanthropy in legal education, and to some degree in higher
education more broadly. Conservative organizations, like the Intercollegiate
Studies Institute and the Institute for Humane Studies, have long
provided grants for like-minded students in PhD programs, to encourage
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 175

them to complete their studies in a timely manner. The Olin Fellows program
is a step beyond these programs or the Olin pre—tenure review
fellowships, in that they are designed to attract the brightest young conservatives
into academic work and equip them with the qualifications to
compete for the top jobs in legal academia. Where most previous conservative
initiatives with university faculty, therefore, involved strongly supporting
the few conservatives who managed to work their way into academic
positions, the Olin Fellows program seeks to actively place them
in those positions in the first place. The Society’s strategy with the Olin
Fellows program builds on the assumption that has governed most of the
Olin-funded efforts to influence higher education, which is that change
filters down from the top.102 Meyer observes that the Society’s standards
for the fellowships are very high. In response to applicants from lowerstatus
institutions, he says, “I am going to be fairly blunt. I know the
situation if someone says, ‘I was first in my class at Dayton Law School
. . . and I have written some op-eds on legal issues. . . . I clerked for a
district court.... That’s great, but honestly almost everybody who has
gotten this has clerked for the Court of Appeals. A number have clerked
for the Supreme Court. If their resume doesn’t look like they’d be competitive
for the Supreme Court, chances aren’t good.” Because of the importance
of marks of distinction in legal academic hiring, the Society almost
always limits its Olin Fellows program to candidates from top law schools
with impressive clerkship and restricts the schools at which fellowships
can be used to those at the top of the law school pecking order.
It is still too early to tell whether the Olin Fellows program has been
effective, and in any case it is very difficult to disentangle the impact of
the program from the influence of a changed legal culture or greater
willingness of law schools to consider hiring conservatives. Table 5.1
shows the fellows from 1997 to 2006, along with the schools that they
graduated from, where they took their fellowship, who they clerked for,
and their current teaching position, if any. Of the thirty-one Olin fellows,
all but ten now have academic teaching jobs. Did the Olin fellowship
program play a role in placing these conservatives in the legal academy?
It is difficult to know. On the one hand, the best placements among the
Olin Fellows have been those with a Supreme Court clerkship (and a
law degree from Notre Dame, Harvard, Yale and Chicago) or a PhD in
economics (Michigan). It would be surprising if candidates like this did
not get an academic teaching position of some sort. Their success could
simply be a sign of the impact of conservative Supreme Court appointments
on the legal academy, and thus a strong argument for a direct
connection between electoral and academic change. In addition, at least
some law schools, especially Harvard, have made a clear push to hire
more conservatives: at almost the same time that Harvard Law hired

former Olin Fellow Adrian Vermeule away from Chicago, they also
hired John Manning and Jack Goldsmith. While all three had sterling
qualifications, there are also indications that conservatives’ rhetoric of
intellectual diversity also helped create a climate in which their hiring
seemed institutionally prudent.103
While the opportunity structure for conservatives in the legal academy
may have become more permissive over the last few years, in interviews
with a number of the Olin Fellows I was told that the fellowship had
a substantial impact on their career trajectory. A couple of the fellows
mentioned that they used the fellowship to support work on a second
degree, while a large number of them thought the networks they developed
while a fellow, the experience of faculty seminars, and the prestige
of the fellowship made a difference in obtaining an academic job. One
fellow’s assessment of the impact of his fellowship was “that it had a
substantial impact. I became better acclimated to legal academia (as opposed
to my prior graduate work).... I made contacts and developed
friendships with academics that have proven invaluable in both professional
and personal terms, and I made great strides in becoming a legal
scholar. More important, I acquired the knowledge and skills that made
it possible for me to succeed in obtaining a full-time academic position
the year after my fellowship (and I received multiple job offers).”104 One
very highly placed fellow observed that he thought it was unlikely that he
would have gotten an academic job without the fellowship, because
“there would be no time to write.”105 This fellow had not published any
articles before his fellowship year, but he was able to finish two articles
that year and start a third. Laurence Claus, with degrees from Australia
and Britain, observed that the fellowship “gave me an opportunity to
write a substantial piece of U.S. constitutional law scholarship and to
explore the US entry-level teaching market. Without it I probably would
have taken an academic position in Europe and would have entered the
U.S. academy, if at all, only much later as a lateral appointment with an
already-established reputation.” Finally, a fellow from a less highly
ranked law school observed that the fellowship “taught me how to approach
scholarly topics, it provided an opportunity to learn about game
theory, it gave me the chance to make contacts with top-notch scholars
at least one of whom has continued to serve as a mentor, it added a topnotch
school to my resume, and it allowed me to write and place well two
pieces.”106 It is still early in the history of the Federalist Society’s Olin
Fellows program, but there are some signs that it has helped, at the margins,
to alter the ideological composition of the legal academy that caused
the Society to come into existence in the first place.
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 179

Conclusion

The Federalist Society was founded to dislodge what it saw as the “hegemony”
of liberalism in the key institutions of the legal profession, and as
such has been a critical component in the larger conservative mission of
scaling back liberal successes in the courts. The aspiration of some in the
Society’s leadership, and perhaps more outside it, that the organization
should become a “counter-ABA” is part of the larger conservative movement’s
objective to break what it sees as the liberal control of many of
the institutions of modern America.107 The Federalist Society represents,
without a doubt, the most vigorous, durable, and well-ordered organization
to emerge from this rethinking of modern conservatism’s political
strategy. In fact, it would be difficult to name a case of conservative mobilization
outside of economic and foreign policy, with the exception of
welfare reform, that has been as successful as the Federalist Society.108 If
anything, the success of the Society has been more impressive than the
project of welfare reform. Conservatives had a powerful political resource
in public opposition to liberalized welfare policy, but have not been able
to draw upon a similar popular engagement with matters of judicial philosophy,
apart from occasional distaste for specific liberal initiatives in
the courts. Transforming the courts, therefore, required a strategy of elite
rather than popular mobilization. Conservatives had to create a web of
intellectual, political, and network entrepreneurs who could generate new
legal ideas, dedicated activists, litigation centers, and connections between
individuals across the country that could certify individuals as ideologically
suitable for positions as clerks and judges.
The Federalist Society has played a critical part in building the support
structure of the conservative legal network. The success of the Society
was not predetermined, but has been the product of the careful strategic
leadership of a tight network of individuals who have been with the organization
since its founding, in tandem with the foundation executives and
the well-placed senior members of the conservative legal community who
assisted the Society at critical junctures. The success of the Society is in
large part a product of its self-limitation, driven by its leaders’ strong
commitment to intellectual debate and determination to avoid expanding
into areas that would introduce divisive controversy between its philosophical
wings. This success can also be traced to the effectiveness of the
Society’s peculiar organizational structure in reconciling the goals of a
large participatory membership and an insulated leadership cadre. This
leadership cadre has been able to effectively impress norms of “rational
debate” on the Society that set it apart from other conservative membership
organizations. These norms have enhanced the Society’s effectiveness
180 CHAPTER 5

in persuading outsiders, maintaining dialogue with liberals, and, as a consequence,
reducing the stigma attached to its ideas.
Perhaps the greatest success of the Society is one that must be seen as
double-edged. It has vigorously attempted to expose the “hidden” ideological
bias behind the ABA and America’s law schools. These were once
essential parts of the “American Establishment,” a set of interlocking institutions
that exercised substantial influence over American society, generally
but not always in a liberal direction.109 While the Society, along
with other parts of the conservative movement, has helped weaken the
power of this establishment, it has, counter to its typical members’ philosophy,
further weakened the idea that there are any “neutral” standards,
and in particular any institutions that can be counted upon to defend
them. This is an outcome that should not, in the main, be laid at the feet
of the Society’s leaders. The strategy adopted by the Society was, in large
part, dictated by the difficulty its leaders faced in infiltrating the primary
institutions of the law. As a result, they had little choice but to directly
attack those institutions, expose their underlying ideological orientation,
and present themselves as an alternative to them. The consequence, however,
is that neither the Federalist Society nor its enemies on the left can
count on the authority or legitimacy that the institutions of the law once
held in American life. Partially as a result of the Society’s challenge to the
liberal legal network, the law has become wracked by seemingly unending
ideological conflict, making it even harder to move toward the Society’s
understanding of the rule of law as something that transcends the ideological
conflicts of the day. The Society’s activities have injected competition
into the legal profession, but not, at least for now, a new establishment.

Law and Economics II: Institutionalization

I have the strong feeling that the economic analysis
of law has “peaked out” as the latest fad in legal
scholarship and that it will soon be treated by the
historians of legal thought like the writings of
Laswell and McDougal. Future legal historians
will need to exercise their imaginations to figure
out why so many people could have taken most of
this stuff so seriously.1
—Morton Horwitz, Professor of Law, Harvard
University, 1980

FOR A GOOD DEAL of the period covered in chapter 4, the question that
loomed over law and economics was not whether it was right or wrong,
but whether it was worthy of being considered seriously at all. Among a
large part of the legal academic community, law and economics was
thought to be the province of libertarian eccentrics, a nihilistic project to
undermine the normative foundations of American law, or simply unfamiliar
and vaguely threatening. This atmosphere of stigma meant that
elite law schools did not feel the need to make room for the field or its
adherents, and its ideas could be legitimately ignored. The strategic challenge
of law and economics, therefore, was to remove the field’s stigma
and force a debate on the merits. The engagement of a huge swathe of
legal academia with Richard Posner and the increasing prestige of market
solutions to policy problems (even among liberals) played a large part in
erasing this stigma. Henry Manne’s seminars for judges and law professors
built on these changes in the environment by reducing the mystery
and threat associated with law and economics, associating the idea with
the prestige of federal judges and equipping law professors to intelligently
engage with and contribute to the field.
By the time this chapter opens, in the early 1980s, law and economics
had become a legitimate if still controversial part of the legal academic
community. Law and economics was no longer “off the wall,” but it was
still a distinctly minority approach even in its core areas of private law.2
Today, law and economics is dominant in private law and plays an im-
182 CHAPTER 6

portant role in much of the rest of legal education. The law schools of
Harvard, Yale, Chicago, and Stanford boast over a dozen law and economics
practitioners each, organized into well-funded research centers.
In just twenty years, an economics-focused law school with a libertarian
spirit at George Mason University went from nothing to the U.S. News
top 40. While critical legal studies, its great combatant for the mind of
the legal academy, has been all but vanquished, law and economics continues
to increase in its influence.
Some have argued that the explanatory power of the economic approach,
the changing nature of legal problems, and the spread of scholarly
standards to professional schools made this success inevitable. But it is
difficult to account for the speed and thoroughness with which law and
economics ripped through legal academia without accounting for the role
of organizational entrepreneurship and creative patronage.
Especially important in moving law and economics from a barely tolerated
minority to a dominant presence in legal academia was the Olin
Foundation’s two-decade-long investment in law and economics programs
at the top-ranked law schools in the country. Olin believed that
law and economics represented a rare crack in the liberal legal network,
a beachhead for conservatives otherwise locked out of the elite legal academy.
Beginning in a period when most of those schools had only a handful
of law and economics scholars, Olin’s strategic patronage increased the
visibility and prestige of law and economics, intensified the networking
and productivity of its practitioners, and drew ambitious future law professors
into its sphere. In a profession intensely sensitive to prestige and
distinction, the presence of the Olin programs in elite law schools sent a
powerful signal to institutions further down the academic pecking order
that to “keep up with the Joneses” they needed to hire students trained
in law and economics. Due in substantial part to Olin’s patronage, law
and economics moved rapidly from an insurgency to a part of the legal
academic establishment.
Ironically enough, Olin’s remarkable support of law and economics
came at a time when the ideological character of the field was moving
well beyond its libertarian roots. Law and economics at the elite level
came to resemble disciplinary economics in its overall ideological coloration.3
This represented a substantial shift from the prevailing opinion in
law schools but a far cry from law and economics’ former free-market
enthusiasm. This shift raises the question of how much Olin’s support
transformed law schools, and how much elite law schools transformed
law and economics.
Quite a distance from the Olin Programs’ ivy-covered confines, a very
different model for reshaping the law was developing at an obscure commuter
school in the suburbs of Northern Virginia. While the Olin Founda-
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 183

tion judged that supporting law and economics at the nation’s elite law
schools was the key to transforming legal culture, Henry Manne’s effort
to build an economics-driven law school at George Mason University was
informed by a very different strategy. Unlike the Olin programs, which
were characterized by a focus on methodological sophistication and disciplinary
legitimacy, GMU Law carried forward the more libertarian variant
of law and economics that Manne first encountered at the University
of Chicago. Manne’s law school at GMU would test whether conservatives
could influence the legal mainstream by building a place of refuge
for law and economics’ original libertarian spirit rather than by burrowing
from within at existing law schools. On the one hand, GMU is an
unquestionable organizational success—it is difficult to identify any law
school in the last forty years that has moved so far, so fast. Where its
broader ambitions to influence the character of legal education are concerned,
however, the jury is still out.

A Foothold among the Elite: The Olin Law and Economics Programs

John M. Olin was as establishment a figure as one’s imagination could
fabricate. Olin vacationed and socialized with America’s corporate elite
and through the 1960s his philanthropic activities were not markedly different
than those of other wealthy Americans. Olin was especially generous
to his alma mater, Cornell, and was a member of its board of trustees
from 1954 to 1966.4 It thus came as a shock to Olin when, in 1969,
Cornell’s buildings were seized by armed black students, who squeezed
curricular and other changes from frightened university administrators.5
The events at Cornell led Olin to suspect that the administrators of traditional
charitable institutions no longer shared his conservative values.
George Gillespie, Olin’s private lawyer, recalls that his client “stopped
giving to Cornell at about that time... [and] his philanthropy turned to
what he called the preservation of liberty and the free market system.”
The resignation of Henry Ford II from the Ford Foundation board in
1976 reinforced Olin’s skepticism of traditional philanthropy, and convinced
him that the typical, family-run, perpetual foundation model was
a poor fit for this new kind of strategic conservative philanthropy. It was
at this point that Olin contacted William Simon, who had been the secretary
of the treasury in the Nixon and Ford administrations. Gillespie recalls
that Olin “admired Simon’s way of addressing problems, which was
very directly and almost strident.” Olin trusted that Simon shared his own
conservative vision, and he appointed him to direct a new foundation
designed to ensure fidelity to his intentions. James Piereson, the executive
director of the Olin Foundation from 1985 to 2005, recalls that
184 CHAPTER 6

John Olin did not set the foundation up as a family foundation; these tend to be
outlets for family charities, do not have a strong point of view, and are usually
ineffective in accomplishing anything important. . . . John Olin created a foundation
with a purpose. He appointed various business associates to the board
who shared his philosophy, hired Simon as president, and told them to spend
the money in a generation. These early decisions allowed the foundation to stay
on track until it closed a generation after his death.

Rather than trusting the goodwill and judgment of traditional institutions,
Olin sought to direct his money to individuals that shared his ideological
convictions and appeared to be doing important work, primarily
in the world of ideas.
By the 1970s, John M. Olin feared for the future of the capitalist system
that had made him so wealthy. This fear led to his aggressive grant-making,
and to Henry Manne. Olin was so impressed by the Manne programs
in law and economics that he sought to use them as a model for additional
foundation programming. The July 5, 1979, minutes of the Olin board
of trustees report that “Mr. Olin introduced a discussion of whether laweconomics
programs similar that of Henry Manne at the University of
Miami can be established elsewhere. During the course of discussion, it
appeared to be the view of a number of trustees that it is difficult to emulate
or even transplant successful programs. What is needed, rather, is
to identify institutions and individuals with leadership qualities who are
willing to establish centers for the study of free market economics, including
centers promoting interdisciplinary approaches.”6 Soon thereafter,
Olin encouraged Cornell’s law school to lure Manne and the LEC to Ithaca.
While there was not an explicit promise that Manne’s appointment
would lead Olin to reopen his wallet to Cornell, the possibility that it
would made this a matter of intense interest on the part of the law school
dean and the president.7 Ultimately, the proposal was thwarted by a coalition
of liberal and conservative faculty who opposed law and economics.
The failure of the Cornell gambit deeply frustrated Olin and the foundation’s
trustees. The minutes of the March 27, 1980, board of trustees
meeting report that “after considerable discussion, in which displeasure
in Cornell’s actions was voiced by a number of the Trustees, the Trustees
authorized Mr. Joyce to communicate with Cornell the sense of disappointment
the Trustees felt in Cornell’s unwillingness to appoint
Dr. Manne.” The aborted project of bringing Manne to Cornell confirmed
Olin’s earlier disappointment with the university’s leadership, and, when
combined with his reading of trends in American politics, led him to believe
that the hour for American capitalism was very late. A letter written
by Olin in 1980 to the president of Cornell University indicates his state
of mind at the time.
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 185

I enclose with this letter a copy of an article which appeared in Business Week,
April 23, 1980, entitled “Marxists on the campus—in the faculty.” . . . I cannot
help but feel a situation has developed at Cornell which needs very very serious
study and correction. The article... points out in rather sharp detail the infusion
into the higher educational structure of our country of scholars stemming
back to the 50s and 60s with definite left-wing attitudes and convictions. It
matters little to me whether the economic development is classified as Marxism,
Keynesianism or whatnot—the fundamental involved is the increased development
since F. D. Roosevelt’s 1932 presidency and following World War II of
socialism in our country. There is ample evidence of the growth of liberalism/
socialism, which words I regard in our country as synonymous, and unless this
trend is halted, I very much fear the 1980 decade will bring about very very
serious problems in our own country. . . . I now have the privilege of reflecting
rather in great depth upon the problems which are facing all of us and it is for
this reason I felt I wished to write this letter to you rather emphasizing my
concern about the situation which I feel exists at Cornell, triggered by the recent
law college faculty left-wing rejection of Doctor Manne and his Law and Economics
Center . . . which brings into sharp focus the divided responsibility and
authority existing now between the Board of Trustees, your administration, and
the faculty, which is a cause of deep study upon my part and great concern to
me. I am definitely of the opinion the situation now existing can only worsen
and may result in the intrusion of organized labor into our faculty with its
concomitant problems of contract negotiation to closed shop eventually resulting
in socialism taking over. I feel very strongly the time has come for a
thorough analysis of the existing situation and the development of an alternative
and remedy for correction be instituted as promptly as possible.8

For Olin, the problems of America’s economy and universities were increasingly
of a piece, and law and economics seemed to offer an opportunity
to remedy both. Bolstering this support was Frank O’Connell, Olin’s
former labor lawyer and the first executive director of the Olin Foundation,
who was intimately aware of the interface between law and economics
and as hostile as his boss to government regulation and labor unions.
Law and economics was the Olin Foundation’s first effort at strategic
philanthropy, and its ambitions in the area increased with the foundation’s
ballooning assets. As enthusiasm for the Manne programs waned (as described
in chapter 4) the board’s interest in gaining a foothold in the top
law schools grew. In an early sign of the foundation’s acute concern for
academic distinction, “In 1981, Olin Board member George Gillespie expressed
his concern that many of Manne’s Olin Fellows were entering private
law practice rather than the academy, and those who chose to become
professors were not able to secure appointments at the nation’s best law
schools.”9 By 1983, when the board definitively pulled support from the
186 CHAPTER 6

Simmons Building project, the foundation had decided to seek out other
outlets for its beneficence. This shift from lower-status institutions to the
American elite was reflected in all of the foundation’s programming. As
early as the late 1970s, the board had concluded that funding smaller conservative
schools had little impact on the national debate. “The work of
these schools, however laudable in its intentions, makes little or no difference
in the hearts and minds of Americans as regards attitudes toward free
enterprise, nor do their faculties, alumni, and students tend to influence the
climate of opinion . . . our hull has acquired a few barnacles and it may
now be time to scrape down the hull.”10
Pulling support from Manne’s programs was consistent with this process
of “scraping down the hull,” but personal factors also played a role.
The members of the foundation board were, like John M. Olin, men of
America’s elite. Piereson recalls that

our trustees were focused on elite institutions because by and large this is where
they went to school. [Richard] Furlaud and [Peter] Flanigan went to Princeton;
Gene Williams went to Yale; Gillespie to Harvard Law School; Chuck Knight
to Cornell.... These trustees wanted us to work with elite institutions, not so
much because they were influential but because this is the world they lived in.
From my own point of view, I felt that we could have greater influence if we
could penetrate these institutions, because they are emulated by other colleges
and universities of lesser stature. Thus, the trustees and staff came to the same
conclusion via different routes.

This elite-focused strategy was also influenced by a desire to honor John
M. Olin, with whom much of the board was personally close. The
minutes of a 1981 Olin Foundation Steering Committee meeting report
that in a discussion of the Olin Fellows at Emory, Gillespie suggested
that Henry Manne “be contacted to encourage stricter criteria be used
in selection of future participants in this program, especially if John M.
Olin’s name is to be associated with the Center.”11 The meeting prior to
the foundation’s decision to eliminate the Olin Fellows program at
Emory observed that the “SC [Steering Committee] thought that a fellowship
program bearing Mr. Olin’s name might be better pursued at
an institution of greater influence and reputation.”12 While the Olin
Foundation was certainly in the business of strategic philanthropy, therefore,
it was not wholly lacking in the traditional philanthropic motivations
of burnishing the benefactor’s memory.
The effort to bring law and economics programs to elite institutions
was, at least at the start, an initiative of the foundation’s board. As James
Piereson recalls, “Mike Joyce [the Olin Foundation’s executive director
from 1979 to 1985] was not all that sympathetic about law and economics.
I’ve talked to Mike about this. He thought it was too abstract or
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 187

theoretical. He was more interested in the intellectual combat you find
in the magazines. However, our board members were very interested in
working with these law schools.” George Gillespie recalls supporting law
and economics “was really not a staff initiative. . . . The board took a
greater interest, and understood more fully what we were doing than in
some of the other programs.” At the same meeting where the board
agreed to withdraw its support from the Olin Fellows at the LEC, they
decided that

efforts should be made to identify one of the top dozen or so law schools in the
United States at a university with an outstanding economics department whose
law and economics faculties would support institution of a law and economics
program similar in scope to that which had been offered at the University of
Miami Law School and Emory University Law School for law students who
might be known as John M. Olin Fellows. The trustees emphasized in the course
of their discussion the desirability of emphasizing both the quality of the institution—law
school and economics department—and the quality of the students
and faculty who might be invited to participate in a John M. Olin Law and
Economics Program.13

With that decision, the Olin Foundation’s project to inject law and economics
into the nation’s elite law schools was launched.
The foundation’s aggressive expansion of its programming in law and
economics reflected its newly increasing ambitions. At the January 22,
1981, board meeting, William Simon “stressed the importance of staff
using its imagination in evaluating and planning the Foundation’s programs,”14
leading to a major effort at long-term planning. A November
1982 report to the trustees, which Piereson recalls was “heavily influential
in shaping the subsequent direction of the foundation,” laid out this
new approach. The report noted that grant-making had declined over
the previous few years because of the dearth of attractive applications.
As a consequence, the staff noted that “in the future, the Foundation
may have to increase its efforts to seek out high quality projects.”15 In
contrast to its previously passive approach, the report recommended
that the foundation should operate more like a “venture capitalist, who
seeks new and more productive investments for his funds. He initiates
opportunities. Following this model, the Foundation’s staff could begin
to search out new projects, discuss them with the Steering Committee
and Board of Trustees, suggest them to qualified individuals or organizations,
and use Foundation grants to make them realities. . . . Where the
Foundation has attempted this, as in the creation of the Law and Economics
movement, its efforts have been successful.”16 This entrepreneurial
turn was facilitated by the foundation’s steadily increasing assets. As
Piereson recalls, “After John Olin died in 1982, almost $60 million came
188 CHAPTER 6

into the Foundation from his estate. He died at precisely the point when
the long bull market of the 1980s took off. When I came in as executive
director at the end of 1985, those assets had increased to $100 million
at a time when we were spending less than $5 million per year. I had the
latitude of spending a lot of money very quickly without everyone in
the world knowing we had it. Otherwise we would be inundated with
proposals, but instead we were able to pick our spots, and allocate this
money before the wide world knew we had it.”17 Law and economics
would be the most important target of the foundation’s entrepreneurial
ambitions and loosened purse-strings.
The first of the new Olin programs began with a meeting between the
foundation staff and Professor Gerhard Casper of the University of Chicago
Law School. Piereson recalls that “Gillespie and Simon at a Steering
Committee meeting told Mike [Joyce], go out to Chicago and get a law
and economics program at Chicago. It was not something Mike would
have done on [his] own; they told him to do it.” After meeting with Casper,
he says, “We did make a grant to Chicago, and that became the prototype
for others. There was faculty research, visiting lecturers, student fellowships,
some other things which would provide a basis for the group
to grow in the law school. . . . Eventually we did develop the idea that we
could influence legal education more broadly this way, by funding these
programs at several important places.”
The decision to start law and economics centers at elite law schools
represented a turn to a more directive, strategic form of patronage. With
a professional staff and a broad portfolio of supported projects, the foundation
could serve as a focal point for learning and feedback in the development
of the conservative movement’s intellectual infrastructure. The
foundation was especially alert for opportunities to influence legal education:
just as it was supporting conservative students in elite law schools
through the Federalist Society, law and economics offered entre´e into the
faculty. Piereson recalls,

I also had the view that it was important to get into the law schools. I felt they

were very important institutions, and it was important to have some sort of
presence there. Remember, by now the Federalist Society had started, so you
had student groups forming. Because of that, you had a way to bring various
speakers in and activities. The law and economics thing now seemed like a way
to work on the faculty side and the curriculum. As time passed, the Federalist
Society chapters did work very closely with the law and economics people on
the faculty. They became their advisors and so on. A lot of them became speakers
in Federalist Society activities, like Richard Epstein. So they worked on parallel
tracks. . . . I would have preferred to do something in constitutional law,
but you couldn’t really do that; you didn’t have enough people inside the univer-
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 189

sities, inside the law schools, to do that. If you said to a dean that you wanted
to fund conservative constitutional law, he would reject the idea out of hand.
But if you said that you wanted to support law and economics, he would see
that as a program with academic content and he would be much more open to
the idea. Law and economics is neutral, but it has a philosophical thrust in the
direction of free markets and limited government. That is, like many disciplines,
it seems neutral but isn’t in fact.

The foundation’s leaders did not have a strong sense of the subtleties of
the field, especially the differences between libertarians trained in law like
Epstein and the rising generation of law and economics professors—many
of whom had PhD’s in economics—more interested in doing work that
was respectable among professional economists. In their defense, the
foundation’s leaders were also realistic about how much they could direct
the evolution of the field or pick and choose whom to support. Law and
economics seemed like the opening in the world of elite legal education
that they were looking for, and they quickly committed serious resources
to the project.
After Chicago, the foundation went to Yale, where it was able to take
advantage of the presence of George Priest, a prolific Chicago-trained
scholar who had recently arrived at the law school. Before Olin began
supporting law and economics at Yale, there was a small law and economics
presence on the faculty and only the nub of an institutional structure.
Priest recalls that while there were people at the law school with an interest
in law and economics (Guido Calabresi, Robert Bork, Ralph Winter,
Bruce Ackerman, and starting in 1983, Jerry Mashaw),

there was no institutional feature at all. [Dean] Harry Wellington, largely as a
fund-raising effort, created something called the Program on Civil Liability, of
which Guido [Calabresi] was supposed to be the director, and they were going
to raise corporate money. Well, anyone who knows Guido’s views knows he is
pretty liberal if not radical. So they raised a little money, but not a lot. When I
came here, the year after I came here, I headed that program. Guido had never
written on business; he wrote on accidents, and the only connection to business
came through insurance. Harry Wellington had some ties from the insurance
industry, and he raised some money from there for civil liability reform. But
Guido wasn’t business oriented, and I was, it wasn’t so much conservative as
it was a more business practical orientation. So I raised some money, and we
had some conferences.

Thus, while law and economics was certainly not absent from Yale, “It
still wasn’t much of an institutional presence.” The Olin Foundation
moved law and economics at Yale from a primarily research-based project
of a few professors to a much more wide-ranging program capable of
190 CHAPTER 6

making a substantial imprint on the culture of the school. Priest concludes,
“What the Olin Foundation did was [provide] an infusion of new
money, which we used for a workshop, a journal, student scholarships;
we brought fellows in. It was not controversial in the slightest, because it
brought in a lot of money, and schools can always use money.”
The foundation hoped to make law and economics an institutionalized
part of Yale Law School, and by 2000 the staff thought they had succeeded.
An Olin grant proposal record concludes that

staff considers the law and economics program at Yale to have been an excellent
investment. George Priest is a preeminent scholar in the law and economics
movement, and his students have achieved remarkable success. Sixty-one former
JMO Fellows hold professorial positions at American law schools; 11 former
JMO Fellows have clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court, one for the Supreme
Court of Australia and two for the Supreme Court of Israel; 105 JMO Fellows
have clerked for Judges on the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal; 66 JMO Fellows
have clerked for Judges on U.S. District Courts; and seven JMO Fellows have
clerked on state supreme courts. This is one of our most influential Law and
Economics grants (along with Harvard and Chicago) and staff believes the Yale
program is well worth sustaining after we close our doors. Moreover, Dean
Anthony Kronman has written a very strong letter. . . . in which he commits to
raising an endowment for a chair in Law and Economics as well as for other
programs at the Center. Clearly, he is doing all he can to assure the permanency
of the program.18

The foundation believed that its support for law and economics at Yale
had delivered what the Manne programs had not—a substantial impact
on America’s legal elite (especially students, who were always a greater
concern for the foundation than was faculty research) and an entrenched
position for the field at the nation’s top law schools. On the other hand,
some of this perceived success with students was simply a function of
attaching the Olin brand to future lawyers who would have ended up
succeeding regardless. In fact, at least some of the Yale John M. Olin
Fellows, such as current Yale Law professor Reva Siegel, were anything
but sympathetic to the foundation’s goals. Where Henry Manne’s prominent
position at less prestigious institutions gave him almost complete
control over the direction of his programming, the Olin programs in
elite law schools like Yale were under much greater pressures to adapt
to their surroundings.
The success of the Olin programs in the 1980s was, in large part, a
consequence of investments made in the previous decade. As Piereson
recalls, “There was not much else going on in law and economics [in the
1970s] other than Manne’s programs. At that time, we could not have
spent much more in law and economics. In . . . the eighties [law and eco-
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 191

nomics scholars] began getting jobs at very good places, and they could
mount these programs. Priest was at Yale, Shavell went to Harvard. All
you needed was one or two people in a law school, and they could begin
to build.” Some of the seeds of the growth of law and economics in the
1980s had been planted at Chicago, and others by the Manne programs.
Both Priest and Cornell’s Jonathan Macey had been active participants in
Manne’s Liberty Fund conferences, and a number of the alumni of
Manne’s economics seminars for professors had moved into top teaching
positions. The rise of “fundable faculty” in law and economics was, therefore,
not exogenous to conservative patronage, but to a significant degree
a consequence of its earlier work.
Equally important in explaining the foundation’s decision to set up law
and economics programs at the top law schools were the advantages of
law and economics’ ideological ambiguity. Imagining the difficulties in
starting similar centers at the nation’s top law schools in “originalist jurisprudence”
is sufficient to make this point clear. Piereson observes that
“you couldn’t get into the law schools with programs targeted at constitutional
law. . . . When you went in with law and economics, you didn’t
need to specify anything about the content; the content took care of itself,
because economics is what it is. If you went in with constitutional law,
you wouldn’t want Larry Tribe constitutional law, you’d want Bob Bork
constitutional law. But you couldn’t go in and say that.” Also helping law
and economics programming avoid direct opposition was its concentration
in the early 1980s in areas that were not on the cutting edge of the
nation’s cultural wars—such as antitrust, torts, and economic regulation—and
that were widely acknowledged to be intellectually weak and
thus a relatively soft target.
Law and economics was also interesting to the foundation’s board in
a way that constitutional and other hot-button areas of the law were not.
Gillespie recalls that “law and economics, even though I’m not an economist,
I can understand the analysis that goes into it, and it seems right to
me. . . . I don’t read Supreme Court decisions on the progeny of Roe v.
Wade. It doesn’t interest me. . . . It had to do with the kind of board we
had. . . . John Olin was first and foremost a businessman, and this is a
business approach to the law.” While the staff were, if anything, more
motivated by constitutional questions, the board made the final decisions,
and their heart was clearly in law and economics. The board’s interest,
combined with the presence of law and economics professors at the top
law schools, made it an attractive candidate for the foundation’s growing
funds. This set the stage for the foundation’s ambitious effort to change
what was then the nation’s most influential law school—Harvard.
192 CHAPTER 6

Law and Economics and the Battle for Harvard Law School

Where the Olin Foundation’s main goal at Chicago and Yale was to accelerate
trends that were already in motion, its ambition at Harvard Law
School was much more audacious. At Harvard, the Olin Foundation
sought nothing less than the ideological redirection of the law school, and
the defeat of its most dynamic faction, critical legal studies (CLS). The
foundation’s leaders believed that Harvard played a pivotal role in the
nation’s legal profession, and that its control by CLS would give the Left
a powerful platform for shaping the development of the law. In these
conservatives’ minds, law and economics was the only movement capable
of providing an intellectually respectable alternative, and the foundation
committed millions of dollars to its support. While other factors played
an important part in the defeat of CLS over the next two decades, the
Olin Foundation’s patronage of law and economics at Harvard certainly
played a critical part.
Because of its size and prestige, Harvard Law School has an outsized
impact on American legal culture and the character of the legal professoriate.19
The foundation also became interested in developments at Harvard
for reasons that had little to do with the intrinsic merits of law and economics,
but a great deal to do with concerns that board members (especially
Gillespie) had with trends among the school’s faculty—especially
the growth of CLS. While CLS was a sweeping movement, a few of the
beliefs of its adherents deserve our attention. First and perhaps most
crudely, CLS was an effort to create a community of left-leaning law professors
seeking intellectual sustenance, community, and power in numbers.20
Second, CLS supporters saw themselves as the true inheritors of
legal realism, arguing that law was essentially indeterminate and consequently
its interpretation was “politics all the way down.”21 Third, the
belief that law was reducible to politics drove CLS scholars like Morton
Horwitz to demonstrate the ways that the law, far from being neutral,
had supported the interests of the powerful, especially business.22 Fourth,
CLS supporters believed that the ideology of legalism and rights had deradicalized
social movements of the left, directing their protest into safe,
“liberal” channels incapable of achieving their transformative goals. Finally,
CLS trumpeted the belief that not only was the “personal” political,
but so was the “professional.” Genuine radicalism required that the law
schools’ role in perpetuating “hierarchy” be exposed and that they be
transformed into sites for political resistance.23 The challenge these tenets
represented for both legal liberalism and modern conservatism proved,
for a time, powerfully stimulating to scholarship as well as activism.
The growth of CLS was an unintended effect of the effort in the 1970s
to inject greater intellectual energy into Harvard by attracting young, in-
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 193

tellectually exciting professors. Derek Bok, the president of Harvard when
CLS faculty were hired, recalls,

I think we did recognize that they had different views, which was regarded as
a strength, because the law school, like many other law schools throughout the
fifties and sixties had been, while full of very bright people, was characterized
by a uniformity of approach that a number of people thought was intellectually
unfortunate. One of them was Erwin Griswold, so this wasn’t any effort to
get more liberal voices per se. Erwin of course was a very staunch Republican
conservative of the old school, liberal on civil liberties, conservative on economic
matters, but he felt there ought to be more diversity in the faculty, and
that was a common view. People saw the appointment of people like [Roberto]
Unger and Morty Horwitz, who had historical training and Duncan Kennedy
as a step in that direction.24 They tended to have different intellectual approaches.
. . . It wasn’t thought of in left-right terms at all.

By the late 1970s, however, Bok and others sensed that while hiring
Unger, Horwitz, Kennedy, and others had increased the intellectual dynamism
of Harvard, it also created a deep conflict over the direction and
control of the school. By the time that CLS became a topic for discussion
within the Olin Foundation in 1984, many observers wondered if the
movement was on its way toward control of Harvard. Particularly
alarming to graduates of the old Harvard Law was Duncan Kennedy, who
proposed using first-year classes, such as his class on torts, to “teach our
students that bourgeois or liberal legal thought is a form of mystification.”25
Even more disturbing, he encouraged young lawyers (in the Harvard
Law School Bulletin, a publication read by alumni), to “reconceive
the internal issues of firm hierarchy as an important part of one’s political
life, fighting the oligarchy of senior partners, opposing the oppression of
secretaries by arrogant-young men who turn around and grovel before
their mentors.”26 Such statements were to be expected from the students,
perhaps, but from professors at a school that was famous for the rigor—
some would say the sadism—of the faculty? Lawyers like Gillespie were
not especially concerned that Kennedy would succeed in injecting his acolytes
into firms like Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Gillespie recalls, “I didn’t
care about that—it wasn’t going to happen, or at least I didn’t regard it
as a risk.” Kennedy’s real threat was to what men like Gillespie saw as
the traditional, civilized place of Harvard within the legal profession. To
them, Kennedy represented a kind of professional barbarism.
The publication of an article in the New Yorker by Calvin Trillin, claiming
that supporters of CLS had enough support to block appointments,
convinced the Olin Foundation board that the situation at Harvard had
become critical.27 The May 22, 1984, minutes of the foundation report
that George Gillespie “asked that staff consider what could be done in
194 CHAPTER 6

the area of critical legal issue studies at Harvard University and suggested
that they confer with the most reputable scholars known to them in this
field to prepare a presentation to the Trustees for discussion at May 31
meeting.”28 At that meeting, the board of trustees agreed that it should
seek “to support scholars at leading universities who are able to advance
the intellectual case against the CLS movement through public lectures
and debates, publication and research” as well as “emphasize support of
assistant law professors in the John M. Olin program of support for the
untenured faculty.”29 Harvard Law professor Philip Areeda was invited
to the next board meeting to help the foundation develop its strategy.30
Areeda was not a law and economics scholar, in the contemporary meaning
of the term, but a “traditionalist” deeply committed to Harvard’s
inherited understanding of the purposes and means of legal education.31
Areeda’s close friend Derek Bok confirms that he was deeply shaken by
the conflict at Harvard Law.

There were even times when he was thinking of leaving the law school because
he found it personally unpleasant. It focused particularly on the appointments
process, where critical legal studies were always pushing their people, and of
course that created great resistance on the other side, and by the end a lot of
people lost their objectivity because they were consumed in this kind of battle
between those people who thought . . . they could take over the law school.
Probably not the most realistic view, but some of them entertained it, and were
pushing for more and more faculty members who were part of their group, and
this infuriated people on the other side. There was never a complete breakdown,
but there was a lot of bitterness and unpleasant debates, unsatisfactory outcomes,
in the sense that it became hard to get anyone through, which caused
Phil a lot of anxiety and upset.

Areeda had the good fortune to have Bok and Gillespie, his old law school
friends, as allies in the project of countering CLS. Gillespie recalls,

I was a friend of Phillip Areeda. . . . We were together on the Harvard Law
Review. He was a year ahead of me; he was a classmate of Sam Butler’s [Gillespie’s
partner at Cravath, Swaine]. Sam was very active in Harvard affairs over
time. Derek Bok, the president of Harvard, was also on the Harvard Law Review
with me, also a class ahead of me, a classmate of Butler. . . . Sam talked
quite a bit with Derek . . . and I invited Phil Areeda to sit and talk with us at
the foundation about the critical legal studies problem, and how that could be
turned around.

While Areeda was increasingly losing control of the situation within Harvard’s
walls, his alliance with the Olin Foundation allowed him to, in
effect, expand the zone of conflict. Without this alliance, he might have
simply given up the fight.
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 195

The Olin Foundation board’s meeting with Areeda cemented its determination
to use law and economics as a counter to CLS. In December
1984, members of the board met with the dean of the Law School, James
Vorenberg, and Professor Steven Shavell “to discuss the possible establishment
of a law and economics program at Harvard Law School . . .
those present at the meeting (Samuel C. Butler and Messrs Gillespie and
Joyce) had focused on the possible law and economics program as a
counter to the Critical Legal Studies Group within the Harvard Law
School faculty. Mr. Gillespie also reported that he and Mr. Joyce had
strongly suggested that any such program at Harvard Law School should
include a significant emphasis on student programs.”32 Gillespie was especially
interested in the example of the newly created Olin program at
Yale, asking in January 1985 “if this program could be suggested as a
model to Harvard in planning a like program.”33 By March 1985 the
foundation approved a grant of $917,000 over three years to support
law and economics at Harvard Law, the money to be spent on student
fellowships, visiting speakers, workshops, research funds, and conferences.
The law and economics program went from original expressions
of concern (May 1984) to funding (March 1985) to implementation (fall
1985) remarkably rapidly, which was a necessity in a context as volatile
as Harvard Law School in the mid-1980s.
When the foundation first became engaged with the situation at Harvard,
the group of law and economics scholars at the school was limited
to Steven Shavell and Louis Kaplow. Shavell recalls that the foundation
board members “did not tie their support to particular pet projects. They
really gave us freedom to develop our programs as we saw fit, the only
real constraint being that, usually, they wanted a certain [percentage of
their funds] to be spent on students as opposed to faculty research.” From
the start, the Olin Foundation was not particularly engaged with the particular
ideological or methodological coloration of law and economics at
Harvard, assuming that it was generally sympathetic to markets and that
it was futile to seek control over its substance in any case. As Shavell
notes, the foundation’s more pressing concern was that its programming
reach students, which is a sign that its focus was on the character of the
law school, not the substance of scholarship. On this dimension, the Olin
funding was a success, giving a small group of lawyer-economists a much
larger footprint on the culture of Harvard than they would have had without
it. As Duncan Kennedy recalls, the Olin program provided

something to affiliate with. If they’re going to create a law and economics counterinsurgency,
it means that they’re going to have unbelievable resources available
to do it. And they had a genuine organizational talent. . . . They created,
using the Olin money, a genuine community. The money wouldn’t have done
196 CHAPTER 6

them any good if they didn’t have the capacity to organize through the law and
economics workshops. . . . Everybody who did law and economics in the country
came to the workshop. Students could come to the workshops. . . . They
[produced] . . . the impression that there’s a national thing even though there’s
only two people there.

The Olin funding came at a time when CLS—despite its extreme
claims—seemed to be the only source of genuine intellectual ferment in
Harvard Law School. The “traditionalists” were in no position to provide
an alternative to CLS, wedded as they were to older, less intellectual traditions
in legal scholarship. Law and economics scholars like Shavell and
Kaplow, on the other hand, could compete with CLS on its own intellectual
terms, and with funding from the Olin Foundation they could provide
an alternative community for students who recognized the exhaustion
of the traditionalists.
At the same time that Olin initiated its support of law and economics
at Harvard, the Federalist Society launched a very public effort to convince
the legal profession that Harvard Law was out of control.34 Much
of the Society’s 1984 conference at Harvard was devoted to attacks on
CLS, and this came hot on the heels of the publication of Trillin’s article
and the exit of traditionalist Paul Bator for Chicago, who pointed to battles
with CLS as the reason for his move. This effort to heighten the perception
of crisis reached a crescendo in May 1985, in a debate at the New
York City Harvard Club sponsored by the Federalist Society that pitted
Kennedy and Abram Chayes on the left against Paul Bator and Robert
Clark on the right. The Society’s advertising for the event was, itself, an
important part of its strategy to publicize the “crisis” at Harvard. It trumpeted
CLS’s supposedly outrageous views and told Harvard alumni that
the Society believed that it was “important to bring to the attention of
alumni the pervasive effects this movement is having at Harvard Law
School.”35 At the panel, both Bator and Clark pressed the point that, in
addition to its rejection of “science, business and the legal profession,”
CLS had a damaging effect on Harvard, making it difficult for the faculty
to make offers and encouraging candidates to reject them.36 Extending
the offensive after the symposium, the Society had transcripts of the event
sent to all New York—area Harvard alumni. George Hicks concludes that
the Federalist Society event “initiated a strong wave of alumni support
for getting things back under control, and it identified Clark as someone
who would fight back.”37
The perception of crisis helped CLS’s foes to further expand the zone
of conflict, linking the beleaguered anti-CLS faculty members with allies
outside the University. CLS’s opponents combined this outside support
with a well-positioned internal ally, Harvard president Derek Bok. Bok
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 197

denies that his concern with CLS was due to alumni pressure, arguing
that his involvement with the Law School was due to

the situation itself. What I really feared was not alumni reaction, what I feared
was that people like Phil would just get upset and leave, which I am sure would
have upset the Law School, but what I really feared was that the Law School
would be greatly diminished. . . . I got more involved in the appointments process
because I had lost a certain degree of confidence in the objectivity of the
process because people on both sides were so engaged in the battle with the
other side that... people’s judgment[s] were being influenced by political and
tactical considerations rather than a dispassionate view of the quality of the
candidate. So I did something that hadn’t been done before, which was on a
few occasions insisted on having an ad hoc proceeding where we brought in
people from outside the Law School faculty, which is a common procedure but
not used in the memory of man in the Law School. But we imposed it anyways,
in the case of a few appointments that . . . circumstances suggested needed a
dispassionate review.38

While alumni played a role in Bok’s decision, insofar as they were part of
an unwelcome public relations problem for the university, it seems more
likely that Bok became involved for a simpler reason: no Harvard president
would wish to preside over the implosion of one of the university’s
most important assets. This public relations problem reinforced Bok’s
instinct toward institutional conservation. Bok was a Cold War, “vital
center” liberal, and as such was closely attuned to the threat to liberal
institutions that could come from the left.39 Kennedy believes that the
memory of the conflict-ridden 1960s played a role as well. “In this period,
there’s still the smell of gunpowder, there’s still a dim haze in the skies
over Cambridge.” It is not difficult to imagine that someone like Bok
would be alarmed that a faction with as little interest in institutional preservation
as CLS could attain veto power at Harvard Law School.
With the resignation of Dean Vorenberg in 1989, Bok had an opportunity
to appoint someone who would do what the previous dean had not
done—get the situation at Harvard under control. Clark’s scholarly work
had drawn on law and economics (even though he lacked the technical
skills of Shavell and Kaplow), and the Olin program represented a major
institutional commitment opposed to CLS’s vision of law. It thus made
sense for Clark to build up law and economics, both because of its inherent
merit and because it could act as a counterweight to CLS. Before Clark
became dean in 1989, there were five law and economics faculty at the
law school (three of which were appointed after the creation of the Olin
program): Steve Shavell, Lewis Kaplow, Lucian Bebchuk, Reinier Kraakman,
and Howell Jackson. During Clark’s term of office, hiring in the
area accelerated, as Kaplow was placed on the appointments committee
198 CHAPTER 6

and law and economics hires were made in 1992 (Bruce Hay), 1994
(Christine Jolls, Einer Elhauge), 1995 (W. Kip Viscusi), 1997 (John
Coates), 1998 (J. Mark Ramseyer), 1999 (Mark Roe and Allen Ferrell)
and 2002 (Guhan Subramanian). Law and economics became a major
faction in the law school, and the alliance of many of its members with
the traditionalists made it difficult for CLS to get appointments of its own.
Dean Clark and his allies in law and economics succeeded in reducing
CLS to a small minority, no longer a significant power in the school’s
decision-making. Just a few years after its initial investment, the foundation’s
staff concluded that their investment had been a success, both in
fostering a movement sympathetic to free markets and in shifting the balance
of power in the nation’s most visible law school. The staff wrote to
the foundation’s board in 1993 that

when we began supporting Law and Economics some years ago, our goal was
to create programs in the leading universities in the hope that this investment
would establish the field as a legitimate area of study in schools all over the
country. Our initial hopes have been fulfilled: Law and Economics has become
a major field of specialty in the law schools, and has had a pervasive effect on
legal thinking not only in the law schools but also in the courts, in business and
in government generally. In addition, Law and Economics gives us an important
foothold in law schools that we would not have otherwise. Conservative students
tend to gravitate to professors in law and economics, and the discipline provides
an intellectual framework within which to criticize the doctrines that are taught
by liberal and left-wing faculty (by far the majority in most law schools). Our
program at Harvard has been very successful in the years since it began in 1985.
Initially, there were only two or three faculty with any interest in the field and
the Dean at the time was unsympathetic. Since then, however, the number of
students in the field has increased dramatically and the presence of Law and
Economics in the curriculum has expanded as well. The number of faculty with
expertise in Law and Economics has also grown; currently the school has eight
faculty members whose main specialty is Law and Economics, and another five
who have substantial involvement with the field. This makes Law and Economics
one of the largest specialty areas within the School. . . . Thus, there is good reason
to believe our investment has paid off well at Harvard.40

Dean Clark, who shared an interest in thwarting CLS, agreed with the
staff’s assessment, telling William Simon in 1994 that “the Foundation’s
support has played a crucial role in restoring the academic soundness of
Harvard Law School, an institution whose influence on law and legal
education is indisputably enormous.”41
The Olin Foundation’s money was certainly not the only cause of law
and economics’ success at Harvard. Once the field came to be seen as a
major movement in legal education, having established a significant posi-
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 199

tion at Yale and Chicago, Harvard’s traditional desire for preeminence
put pressure on the school to make additional hires in law and economics.
This pressure would have been present whether the Olin program had
been established or not. One suggestive indication that the Olin program
was far from irrelevant, however, is the number of Harvard law and economics
faculty who were trained at Harvard, and thus were able to take
advantage of the resources of the Olin program. For example, Elhauge
received his JD from Harvard in 1986, Ferrell in 1995, Hay in 1988,
Jolls in 1993, and Subramanian in 1998. The Olin program played an
important role in attracting Harvard students into law and economics
and training them sufficiently that they could be hired as professors at
Harvard (and elsewhere). Interestingly, none of the law and economics
faculty hired in this period came from Chicago. This may have been due
to the ideological stigma that attached to Chicago-style law and economics,
but a more likely hypothesis is that Harvard simply has a very high
propensity to hire its own graduates. By building up law and economics
at Harvard, the Olin Foundation deepened the pool of law and economics
practitioners from which Harvard law professors are traditionally drawn.
Had the law and economics faculty members at Harvard depended on
recruiting faculty from other institutions, it is unlikely that they could
have built up the field at Harvard so rapidly. The consequence of that
would have been a smaller law and economics bloc, and with it a smaller
anti-CLS contingent.
The internecine conflict between CLS and law and economics at Harvard
was an important part of the larger battle over the last twentyfive
years for control over American legal culture. The Olin Foundation
entered this battle less because of its commitment to—or even understanding
of—law and economics, and more because it saw the fortunes
of law and economics as tied up with the direction that the legal profession
would take over the next few decades. As I argued in chapter 1,
elite law schools help to generate the legal ideas that shape the long-term
development of doctrine, provide students with the intellectual capital,
professional distinction, and networks that they draw on in their subsequent
careers, and produce the next generation of law professors. A
movement without a significant presence at Harvard and Yale law
schools will, therefore, be hampered in building a support structure for
legal change. The Olin Foundation’s support of law and economics at
Harvard was driven by its fear that the Left might use the Law School
to produce these critical resources for itself and deny them to conservatives.
The foundation’s staff would have preferred to throw their support
behind other forms of legal scholarship that were closer to their conservative
principles, but in the battle to repel the CLS offensive, law and
economics was the only weapon available.
200 CHAPTER 6

The Olin Programs and the Diffusion of Law and Economics

From Harvard, Yale, and Chicago, the foundation quickly moved to
spread Olin programs in law and economics to other elite law schools.
The fact that these leading schools had developed strong, well-funded
programs in law and economics sent a signal to the rest of elite legal
education that this was now a respectable, mainstream field of legal scholarship,
since no field that had a presence at these schools could be considered
“off the wall.” In fact, the presence of law and economics at Harvard
and Yale suggested that the field was now a part of any respectable law
school’s portfolio. The foundation was now pushing against an open
door. Nevertheless, openness to law and economics did not necessarily
translate into the kind of major investment in an area that can transform
the character of an institution. For that to happen in elite institutions,
substantial outside subsidy was required, which was precisely what the
Olin Foundation provided.
In the wake of the foundation’s support of Harvard, Yale, and Chicago,
the Olin programs in law and economics spread very rapidly: Penn in
1986, Stanford, Berkeley, and Virginia in 1987, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown,
and Toronto in 1989, Cornell in 1992, and Michigan in 2000.42
Despite the increasing popularity of the field, these programs would not
have developed as quickly, or had as much impact in elite law schools,
were it not for the support of the Olin Foundation. From January 1985
to January 1989, approximately $4.45 million was donated by the major
conservative foundations to law and economics (including the Manne
programs), of which only $736,000 came from sources other than Olin.
While support for law and economics would broaden somewhat in subsequent
years (see figure 6.1), Olin was the dominant decision-maker in the
area, with other foundations piggybacking on its leadership.43 It is highly
unlikely that any of the other conservative patrons had the will or means
to get these programs off the ground, and no major law school showed
much interest in funding such programs themselves.
After Harvard, Yale, and Chicago, Stanford was the law and economics
program that had the strongest internal support and that received the
most generous funding from the Olin Foundation. By 1987, when Stanford
Law submitted its first proposal for a law and economics center, the
faculty already included eleven professors of law and economics, a number
of whom also held appointments at the Hoover Institution.44 A letter
from the Law School’s dean, Paul Brest, accompanied Stanford’s initial
application and frankly stated, “One of my priorities as Dean is, to put
it immodestly, to develop the preeminent integrated curriculum in law,
economics and business.”45 Stanford received an initial grant of $870,733

for its first three years, and continued to be among the most richly funded
of the Olin programs in law and economics. As was the case at Harvard
and Yale, the place of law and economics in the context of the larger
ideological environment at the University was never far from the Olin
Foundation’s mind, as a grant proposal record from 1996 shows. “Stanford
is, overall, a less conservative institution than the University of Chicago.
But first-rate people who understand and respect markets are a significant
presence—at the law school, the economics department, the
business school and the Hoover institution. The law school, for example,
has thirty-eight faculty members, twelve of whom make the insights of
the law and economics movement an important part of their teaching
and scholarship.”46 The foundation saw supporting law and economics at
Stanford as a way of putting its support behind the relatively conservative
portion of the university’s faculty.
The other reason for the foundation’s strong support of law and economics
at Stanford was its perceived impact on other institutions, through
the production of teaching faculty. The foundation’s staff reported in
1986 that “one mark of his [Mitch Polinsky’s] success is that the number
of students choosing to pursue both a JD and a PhD in economics has
doubled since the early years of the program. Moreover, many of the students
concentrating in law and economics are the most intellectually able
and conscientious in their class, according to Prof. Polinsky. Graduates
of the Olin program have gone on to teaching positions at Berkeley, Har-
202 CHAPTER 6

vard, Yale and Michigan.”47 The foundation shifted its law and economics
programming in the direction of elite institutions precisely because it
thought that these institutions dictated the agendas and produced the faculty
for all the other schools lower on the academic food chain. The foundation’s
2002 retrospective analysis of its grant-making in law and economics
recalled that “trustees saw support for Law and Economics as an
opportunity both to advance cutting edge scholarly research as well as to
gain a foothold for market economics and limited government in the law
schools, whose faculties tended to be very much on the left. . . . The Foundation
made these grants on the ‘trickle down’ theory, expecting that if
all the best schools mounted programs in the field, others would feel the
need to follow.”48 The foundation clearly believed that its Stanford grants,
along with those at Chicago, Yale, and Harvard, had succeeded in influencing
the rest of legal academia, and also in further entrenching law and
economics in the law schools’ curricula. In one of its last grant reports,
the foundation staff reported that

Stanford Law School is a place that takes law and economics very seriously,
and our program has had the full support of the Dean, Kathleen Sullivan. Although
she will be stepping aside shortly as Dean, she assures us in the attached
letter (as well as in two visits to our offices) that Law and Economics is such a
critical part of the Law School that any new dean is bound to be equally supportive.
. . . [Polinsky and] Sullivan are determined to raise the funds required
to continue the program indefinitely. They have pledged to match any grant we
might now make, and to do so on a 2:1 basis for a gift in excess of $2.5 million.
Assuming a new dean is appointed who is sympathetic to Law and Economics
(and Stanford’s president assures us this will be the case), staff would enthusiastically
recommend continued support for this program.49

Law and economics, which had never been particularly controversial at
Stanford, was now effectively institutionalized.
At Stanford, the Olin Foundation saw supporting law and economics
as a way of enhancing the resources of an already distinguished group of
law professors sympathetic to market economics. Berkeley, as a 1987 staff
report noted, was another story.

The law and economics program is not at this point very well developed. It
consists primarily in the activities of two professors, [Robert] Cooter and
[Daniel] Rubinfeld. Staff met with Rubinfeld, and was not overly impressed,
but thought that he might be able to give some impetus to the law and economics
movement at Berkeley. . . . From our contacts in the field, staff has discerned
that Rubinfeld and Cooter are well regarded, but not considered
among the top scholars. . . . Given these considerations, staff thinks a small
grant would be warranted if strategically placed to encourage the growth of
law and economics.50
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 203

Given that the foundation was not overly impressed with the personnel
at Berkeley (a judgment that, in retrospect, was obviously unwarranted
and, as with some of the foundation’s other judgments in law and economics,
not particularly well-informed), why did they choose to put one
of their few Olin centers at Boalt Hall? The staff’s evaluation of Berkeley’s
1994 application makes its motivation clear.

Boalt Hall is one of the two best law schools on the West Coast (Stanford is
the other), and is also one of the very few academic schools/departments at
Berkeley with a conservative presence. Staff believes it is important to maintain
an intellectual beachhead at Berkeley in the form of our Law and Economics
Program. At Berkeley, as at other eminent law schools, most of the faculty
lean to the left; our Law and Economics program is a strong counterweight,
providing intellectual support for rational inquiry, free markets, and skepticism
about what government can achieve. [Name redacted] notes that Berkeley
faces a great deal of funding pressure because of the shortfall in local funds,
so that the infusion of Olin money could make a big difference in keeping Law
and Economics alive here.51

The foundation’s motivation for supporting law and economics at
Berkeley was not idiosyncratic, as staff evaluations of law and economics
programs at Georgetown and Columbia at roughly the same time
demonstrate.

Our grant to Georgetown represented an opportunity to strengthen and expand
a small but sound program in Law and Economics at a law school which is in
a unique position (on Capitol Hill) to draw upon the law and policy resources
of Washington. . . . The last time this proposal came up for funding two years
ago, staff had mixed feelings about it because the quality of one conference was
questionable and the law school had recently disciplined a student for revealing
that admissions office data showed minorities were admitted based on less stringent
criteria than white students.52 Since then, however, staff has gained confidence
in the program, in part because of the praise with which [name redacted]
speak of it. . . . Moreover, Georgetown is an important school, and it undoubtedly
behooves us to “keep a candle lit in the darkness,” by continuing to fund
law and economics inside the school.53
Prof. [name redacted] . . . agrees that Columbia is very strong on corporate
law, and has a great deal of respect for some of the Law and Economics professors
like John Coffee and Mark Roe. But his impression was that the program
may be suffering some directional drift and he advised keeping a close watch
on it. He thought it was worth continued support, however, because it is important
to have a foothold for free-market thinking at Columbia Law School.54

The foundation supported law and economics at Berkeley, Georgetown,
and Columbia for the same reason that it plowed money into Harvard:
204 CHAPTER 6

because it saw the program as an opportunity to shift the ideological balance
in the university at large, as well as in the law school. At Berkeley,
for example, the foundation judged that Cooter and Rubinfeld were well
positioned to influence the future of the law school, noting that they had
both served on major appointments committees, while Oliver Williamson
was head of the Faculty Senate.55 Four years later, the foundation was
impressed with the inroads that law and economics had made at Berkeley,
noting that the program “has assumed an increasingly prominent position
at Boalt Hall, and there are currently ten economists on the law school
faculty.”56 An outside evaluation of the program from one of the leaders
of law and economics concluded that “the program there is quite strong
and has in many ways . . . a Chicago flavor. . . . There is not a huge
amount of top flight brilliance, but there is a lot of very solid competence
with real intellectual energy. . . . The faculty has really turned itself
around for the better in the last couple of years. Overall I think the program
is behind the industry leaders, but certainly within the top ten.”57
Did the increasing presence of law and economics at Berkeley, to take
one example, have the influence on the ideological character of the law
school that the Olin Foundation hoped it would? While Cooter was
clearly on the libertarian-conservative side of the ideological fence, Rubinfeld
was a Democrat and served as assistant attorney general for antitrust
in the Clinton administration. Cooter believes that, despite the fact
that many law and economics professors like Rubinfeld considered
themselves Democrats or liberals in national politics, what really matters
is their placement within the distribution of law school and university
opinion.

The faculty perceives Dan [Rubinfeld] as being conservative while knowing that
he’s a liberal Democrat, and it’s because he’s an economist. In the debates
among the faculty, you may be in favor of affirmative action, you may be as in
favor of affirmative action as the law allows, like Ian Ayres, but you’re still an
economist. You just can’t accept the bull about regulation and control, the nirvana
theory that social programs are going to work because they’re well-intended.
This stuff just doesn’t fly. . . . If you have any judgment about how you
evaluate data, whatever your prior beliefs, you’re going to come out pro-market
in a way that a lot of people in a society are not. I think law and economics is
inherently pro-market, and less inherently conservative. Certainly the distribution
of sentiment in the ALEA [American Law and Economics Association] is
shifted to the right, relative to American law schools, probably relative to the
American public.

Law professors with economics training also differ from other law professors
where decision-making on internal university matters is concerned.
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 205

On our faculty, and on many faculties, the strongest leftists are also the strongest
proponents of what I call “other values.” By other values I mean not the
traditional values by which the quantity and quality of scholarship is to be
evaluated. . . . For example, if you apply those standards, it’s going to be hard
to achieve your affirmative action goals. So as a consequence, the economists
are all committed to those traditional research values. . . . We have a common
framework, and that framework is antagonistic to the other values approach
to choosing faculty members. That’s one of the reasons that a person who is a
liberal Democrat but an economist will be perceived as a conservative by the
rest of the faculty.58

While relatively few of the hires that Berkeley has made in law and economics
would be considered conservatives, what really matters in a university
are faculty preferences on issues internal to the university.59 So
while law and economics has lost the ideological fervor that it once had,
at places like Berkeley the law and economics liberals are to the right of
the rest of the faculty. While that may not be exactly what the Olin
Foundation thought it was getting, their support for law and economics
probably has had the effect of shifting the ideological dynamics in elite
law schools.
The kind of law and economics that was dominant at Harvard, and
that increasingly characterized the Olin programs at other universities,
differed significantly from what was being taught at Chicago and George
Mason. While it is perhaps too simple a formulation, Chicago-style law
and economics was not just more libertarian than what evolved at Harvard,
it was more of a “lawyer’s” version of the field, as opposed to the
more economist-dominated Harvard variant.60 A 1990 report to the Olin
Foundation from a major figure in the field made it clear that law and
economics had changed dramatically since the foundation first committed
to it.

When the field started getting underway in the late 1960s and early 1970s, its
leading practitioners painted with broad and bold strokes. . . . The more recent
developments in the area have been somewhat different. There are fewer manifestos
in support of the discipline, and fewer wholesale attacks on its soundness
and operation. It is no longer fighting for a place within the curriculum, but
has secured powerful beachheads in multiple areas: all the common law subjects
(property, contracts and torts), procedure litigation and settlement, corporate
law, bankruptcy and secured transactions, criminal law. Similarly, the techniques
of analysis have changed. . . . While the overall level of economic sophistication
on faculties has grown, there is probably a greater gap between the
cutting edge of research on the one hand and the knowledge of the ordinary
law professor on the other. The faculty then [sic] tends to go into the area is
206 CHAPTER 6

often armed with both a law degree and a PhD in economics. In consequence
of the level of formality and abstraction, there are conspicuous barriers between
what is done and understood by law and economics types of the one hand, and
the rest of the legal academic world on the other hand.61

Fifteen years later, these trends have only increased, to the point where
most newly minted law and economics practitioners now have dual degrees.
While the field is still certainly to the right of the rest of legal academia
on economic matters, this is because its ideological distribution increasingly
resembles that of the discipline of economics, where even
liberal Democrats are substantially more sympathetic to market arrangements
than most of their academic colleagues. In short, the number of
true believers has declined as the field has become more professionalized.
Given that law and economics’ impact has occurred as the field has become
more ideologically mainstream, did patrons like the Olin Foundation
really get what they were looking for?
To answer this question, we need a relatively compact understanding
of what the patrons of law and economics programs wanted, as compared
to the preferences of the academics who were actually running them. At
least in the case of the Olin Foundation, the motivations were fairly clear.
First and foremost, the foundation believed that the state of legal education
was in grave danger, which was far from a trivial concern for an
organization whose board included partners in the whitest of white-shoe
law firms. By supporting law and economics, the foundation hoped to
establish a “foothold” in the law schools for conservatives, and to provide
a “counterbalance” against liberals. Second, law and economics was just
one part of conservative foundation efforts on university campuses. Law
and economics was a way to get conservative-leaning faculty inside the
university, where they could affect campus debate and governance, at a
time when the barriers to other forms of legal conservatism were much
more considerable. Third, the foundation hoped that, through its grants
to students and its programming in the law schools, the Olin programs
would alter the socialization of the next generation of lawyers, making
them less sympathetic to government management of the economy and
more able to press the case for the free market. Fourth, the foundation
believed that law and economics could have a salutary influence on law
itself, raising doubts about the efficacy of regulation and providing intellectual
support for a legal system more supportive of free markets.
The interests of law and economics professors, by contrast, have only
a partial overlap with those of their patrons. While a number of the law
and economics professors hired in the 1980s and 1990s were avid supporters
of free markets, many were not, and this trend only accelerated
as the field became more mainstream. For the professors who staffed
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 207

them—even those who were more conservative—the most prominent motivation
for building the Olin Centers was purely academic. Professors
doing work in law and economics found the subject stimulating and important
for future lawyers to understand, wanted to build a research infrastructure
for themselves, and hoped to produce high-quality research.
Only a few university administrators, such as Harvard’s Dean Clark, seem
to have shared the Olin Foundation’s ambition to use law and economics
to reshape the politics of their institutions, but by the 1990s most recognized
that supporting law and economics was necessary in order to keep
up with the market leaders. In short, the Olin Foundation was more concerned
with the indirect effects of law and economics—on the law school,
the university, and society and government—while the professors were
interested in their direct outputs, such as facilitating scholarly production
and debate, and increasing the prestige of their field. The relationship
between the Olin Foundation and its law and economics programs was,
in short, a marriage of convenience, albeit one that brought substantial
benefits to both sides.

A Home at Last: The George Mason University School of Law

Over the last thirty years, conservative patrons interested in reshaping
higher education have focused on gaining a presence in elite institutions
by supporting student organizations, such as the Federalist Society and
undergraduate conservative newspapers, and by building research
programs around conservative professors. This focus on elite schools was
driven by the belief—especially strong at the Olin Foundation—that intellectual
credibility and distinction are produced by only a handful of institutions.
This explains the foundation’s repeated concern that it create a
“foothold” or “beachhead” and “keep a candle lit in the darkness” at
top-ranked schools. Henry Manne’s project of building George Mason
University School of Law (GMUSL) represented a very different approach
to influencing the legal academy—building an alternative institution
from the bottom up rather than influencing the legal academy from the
top down. While the Olin programs represented a “Fabian” strategy of
slowly burrowing into mainstream institutions, GMUSL followed a
“Gramscian” approach of creating a parallel institution where more libertarian
professors could hone their ideas without the compromises associated
with elite institutions. The consequence of the Fabian strategy of the
Olin Foundation was that, as the previous two sections showed, law and
economics came to adapt to the norms of elite institutions, becoming
more technically sophisticated, closer to mainstream economics, less accessible
to lawyers, and more ideologically heterogeneous. Starting from
208 CHAPTER 6

scratch at GMUSL, Manne was able to build an institution infused with
a “Chicago” flavor—less methodologically formal, more oriented to
shaping doctrine and public policy, and more openly libertarian. A close
examination of Manne’s experiment in Northern Virginia, therefore, provides
a useful study of the challenges and opportunities associated with
one important approach to legal and educational change.
By the mid-1980s, Manne’s opportunity for institution-building at
Emory was finished. As Manne puts it, “I was sort of coasting.” It was
then that Manne received a phone call from the economist Gordon Tullock,
who had, along with James Buchanan, built a public-choice-oriented
economics department at George Mason University, the new state university
in Northern Virginia. The University, led by its president, George
Johnson, had acquired a low-status law school based in Washington,
D.C., and was considering what to do with it. Steve Eagle, an associate
dean under Manne, recalls that “the University president at the time was
interested in putting the University on the map. I’m not sure he was interested
in putting it on any particular continent. He wanted the law school
to make a splash. If he could have gotten someone in a totally different
field than law and economics, he would have done that. As it was, George
Johnson spoke with Jim Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, and both of them
told [him] that Henry was a hot property.” The perception that Manne
was a successful organizational entrepreneur and had an ambitious plan
already developed for legal education made him immensely attractive to
Johnson. Initially, Manne was uninterested.

I said, “Gordon, . . . one thing I would never do was go into an existing law
school, because I couldn’t stand it. They’d run me out on a rail in a year anyways.”
Gordon said, “Well, come up to talk to George and tell him about your
ideas on legal education anyways.” This was 1985. As a favor to Buchanan and
Tullock I agreed to go up and talk to Johnson. They were already there and they
were trying to help Johnson. They had a hidden agenda; they were going to find
conservatives for him. He didn’t mind it, because he had heavy financial support
from Republican interests in Northern Virginia. At any rate, he was very persuasive,
and, given my condition, I was susceptible too. I gave him the program that I
would do. It was basically the Rochester program limited to Law and Economics,
which at this point really looks good. It’s the big hot field in law, but no one had
ever thought about building a law school around it. That’s what I told him I
wanted to do, but that I couldn’t do it with the faculty he had there.

Manne quickly recognized that the weakness of the existing law school,
and Johnson’s desire for an immediate jolt to the University’s reputation
gave him an opportunity that most academic entrepreneurs can only
dream of: liquidating the law school’s existing commitments and starting
anew. The previous dean of the school
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 209

told the faculty, “I want you to get out and practice law. You get no extra money
from me for writing law review articles.” Just the opposite of what any school
would be doing. That played beautifully into my hands, because what George
was telling me, that he’d make some money available to me to buy out faculty,
really was beginning to make sense. . . . I didn’t tell anyone, but I planned to
get rid of every nontenured professor. . . . George convinced me that I could
create a new kind of law school there, even though there was an existing faculty.
. . . I started thinking about it. . . . It became attractive as soon as I saw that
there was a chance of doing what I wanted to do at Rochester.

In building a new law school, Manne had some important advantages.
First and foremost was the LEC. “No one had ever heard of George
Mason Law School, but lots of people had heard of Henry Manne’s Law
and Economics Center.”62 The LEC ensured that the re-formed school
would begin with a widely recognized research program, along with the
still vibrant program for federal judges. Second, the weakness of the inherited
law school allowed Manne to act quickly, before opposition to his
plans could organize. Eschewing the usual advice given new deans to
slowly build the faculty’s trust, Manne decided to conduct a bloodbath.
He immediately fired every nontenured faculty member, offered buyouts
to others, and gave a few of the survivors the opportunity to receive advanced
degrees in economics. Manne recalls that George Johnson instructed
him to “ ‘act fast, do anything you want to do now, because by
next April they’ll be organized.’ I took his advice . . . and within two
weeks I had announced these departures, and, exactly as he said, by April
the cabal had started, but it was too late, because there weren’t enough
of them left.” Acting quickly also had the advantage of freeing up resources
to aggressively add new professors, many of whom he knew
through the Economics Institute for Law Professors.

Because of my familiarity with law professors who had been through the law
institute, I knew a bunch of guys who stayed in touch with me, because they
had really glommed on to the field. And they were at places where they weren’t
happy. . . . So I got Larry Ribstein, who was at Mercer, doing great corporate
work which they didn’t appreciate. [Michael] Krauss was at McGill doing tort
law and economics, and being very underappreciated. I got Frank Buckley, who
was out in western Canada, who had already spent some time at Chicago, and
an economist who had been through our program, Bill Bishop. . . . Then I hired
our former Olin Fellows: Henry Butler, Steve Crafton, and later Lloyd Cohen
and . . . Bruce Johnsen. Then I hired a couple of economists, got a name from
Harold Demsetz, Bruce Kobyashi. He came that year. At that point we had
more PhD’s in economics on the George Mason law school than any other law
school in the country.

On top of selecting faculty who accepted his vision, Manne also made
clear that GMUSL would not be a democracy. “I had an important and
identical discussion with all of them. . . . We’re going to be a law and
economics law school. We’re going to have specialized tracks. . . . I’m
going to run it. We’re going to have faculty meetings when and if necessary,
but this is not going to be a faculty-run operation. In blood every
one of them signed on. It’s what they wanted, what any good academic
wants, for an administrator to run the thing and let them do what they’re
interested in.” The availability of underplaced law and economics faculty,
Manne’s networks, and the reputation of the LEC allowed him to
rapidly build a sympathetic faculty and avoid effective internal challenges
to his plans.
Manne’s plan for the law school closely followed his earlier design at
Rochester: specialization, a pervasive role for law and economics, and the
introduction of required classes in quantitative methods.63 The law school
at GMU, in short, would not look like any other law school in America.
These innovations, however, led to problems with the school’s application
for admission to the Association of American Law Schools.64
The visiting committee of the AALS that began to scrutinize the school
in 1989 was impressed with the school’s rapid progress in its first two
years, but had two concerns: whether the school had the resources to
support its track system and the racial and gender balance of the faculty.
The committee was especially concerned that “the dearth of minority
and women candidates interested in pursuing law and economics might
preclude an effective hiring process geared towards diversifying the faculty
at George Mason.”65 When interviewed by the committee, Manne
argued that he had aggressively sought out women and racial minorities,
but that his insistence on a law and economics faculty limited the pool
he could draw from. At this point a member of the AALS committee
asked whether, if that was the case, there was something flawed about
the overall conception of the school. “Is having a racially and gender
diverse faculty as great a priority at George Mason as hiring a tax professor?
Dean Manne responded that there are trade-offs implicit in any
decision. While the school would continue to work hard to diversify the
faculty, that issue was simply different from the need to teach a given
subject matter.”66 Other members of the committee questioned whether
the school’s effort to increase the academic credentials of its students
was consistent with substantial minority representation on the student
body. In the end, this line of questioning fizzled out when supporters of
GMU School of Law questioned where an affirmative action standard
could be found in AALS rules.
The most daunting obstacle in building a first-rate law school at GMU
was attracting resources for ambitious institution-building in a new uni-
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 211

versity without a significant endowment, a deep pool of alumni, or an
impressive university “brand name.” This challenge hampered the law
school’s growth, damaged its early esprit de corps, and contributed to
Manne’s departure from the school’s deanship. Despite George Johnson’s
commitments to the law school, these financial concerns emerged early
on, as can be seen in a 1987 letter from Manne to the president of the
Earhart Foundation.

As I began to tell you at the AEI dinner, being dean at the George Mason University
School of Law has been an exciting challenge. The pace has been quite
hectic, but we have accomplished minor miracles. Quite frankly, however, the
University, for all its support, has not been able to keep up with us. . . . In
spite of their encouragement, the University administrators did not expect us
to accomplish so much in so short a time. Consequently next year’s budget does
not provide the support services necessary for our new faculty to work to their
full potential. . . . I am especially concerned that we not disappoint the new
faculty, since their first reaction to the School will effectively determine our
academic reputation with new recruits for years to come.67

Manne also faced challenges in obtaining corporate support for GMUSL.
In a letter to one of his supporters, Manne complained, “As you undoubtedly
know, many corporations, perhaps because of obsessive concern with
‘competitiveness,’ are substantially reducing or omitting contributions to
educational institutions. . . . This is all particularly frustrating because I
have finally reached the point where I can greatly leverage the influence
of my programs.”68
While financing was always a problem at GMUSL, Manne had some
very important compensating assets. GMUSL was able to draw upon the
local, Washington-based network of conservative-libertarian lawyers and
jurists, in particular Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg, who quickly
joined GMUSL’s faculty. Jeffrey Parker, one of the earliest members of
the faculty, recalls that Ginsburg “was extremely important, and it was
all due to his long acquaintanceship with Henry. . . . There was a core of
these really high-powered people who held the place in the zone of legitimacy
while it was building itself out. . . . Doug had taught at Harvard,
Bork had taught at Yale, these were people who could teach any place. But
because of their relationship with Henry, and because of their intellectual
interest in law and economics, they were here.” Ginsburg, now the chief
judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has, in fact, taught at least
one seminar a year since 1988. Manne recalls of Ginsburg that “while
still at Harvard he attended the Economics Institute for Law Professors
and became totally convinced (if he was not already) of the importance
of law and economics. I knew him to be extremely bright, and I wanted
him associated with the school as much as anything in order to help me
212 CHAPTER 6

out. Also I knew he would be a superb teacher. I don’t think that any
really important steps were taken without being vetted with Doug.”
Other connections to the conservative movement have helped GMUSL,
especially its support from the University’s increasingly conservative
board of trustees. Starting with the administration of Governor George
Allen in 1994 and continuing into that of Governor James Gilmore, such
conservative movement fixtures as William Kristol, Ed Feulner, and James
Miller were chosen for the board, and Ed Meese was appointed the University’s
rector. These men were very familiar with law and economics
and sensitive to the asset that a libertarian-tinged law school in the D.C.-
area would represent for the conservative movement. The importance that
the conservative movement attributed to GMUSL can also be seen in a
1993 grant report from the Olin Foundation, which had sharply reevaluated
its judgment of Manne.

Henry Manne has accomplished a great deal for the discipline of law and economics.
Over forty percent of sitting federal judges have now attended one of
his institutes, and the reliance on economic criteria to help make sense of legal
problems is steadily winning acceptance in the courts after establishing a foothold
in the law schools. George Mason is a law school with a growing reputation,
and its serious commitment to law and economics gives it something
unique to offer students. Staff believes that continued support for the Law and
Economics Center at George Mason is warranted by these accomplishments.
Furthermore, it is important to remember that Bill Clinton’s election means that
conservatives can no longer count on the changing composition of the federal
judiciary to make judges concerned with the economic implications of their
decisions. For twelve years the Reagan and Bush appointments to the federal
bench created a judiciary that was steadily more inclined to consider market
processes and economic effects in the decision-making. With Bill Clinton having
the next three years to appoint liberals to the court, it is especially important
that every sitting judge who is even slightly receptive to the law and economics
approach be given every chance to become familiar with it.69

For a brief period in the late 1990s, the law school had fallen out of the
U.S. News top 50 law schools, a list that is highly sensitive to faculty
resources. William Kristol recalls that, recognizing the importance of the
law school to the conservative movement, “under Meese’s leadership, and
I supported him, . . . we insisted on a reallocation of resources toward
the law school. At the margin we wanted greater effort to go to the law
school. It did happen, and subsequently the dean of the law school told
me that it was useful. . . . This got them back onto the Top 50.” While
modest budget reallocations such as this may seem like a small matter,
they are the sort of support at the margin that can make the difference
between successful and unsuccessful organizational entrepreneurship. To
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 213

the conservatives on the GMU Board of Visitors and the staff of the Olin
Foundation, support for GMUSL was a way to shape the development of
the law, even in periods like the late 1990s when their power over the
courts was waning.
Henry Manne’s original strategy for GMUSL was to take advantage of
the path dependence of American legal education, which he thought was
wasteful and ill suited to the character of contemporary legal practice.
With a new curriculum made possible by of the lack of built-in constituencies
for the status quo, Manne believed that GMUSL could attract highquality
students and place them with top firms. While GMU has been able
to attract increasingly strong students over time, it does not appear that
the school’s pedagogy has given it the overwhelming competitive advantage
Manne anticipated.
Instead, the market failure that GMU has exploited most successfully
has been on the research side of legal education. Theorists since Becker
have modeled discrimination as a “taste,” believing that in a competitive
market discriminators have to pay a price for satisfying this taste in the
form of higher labor costs and consequently lower profits.70 Conversely,
firms that do not discriminate can take advantage of their rivals’ taste for
discrimination, by hiring the better quality (and cheaper) labor that they
have spurned. Conservatives, including those at GMUSL, have long believed
that conservatives are discriminated against in the academy. To the
degree that this is true and entrance to the market is not artificially suppressed,
institutions that do not discriminate on the basis of ideology
should have a substantial competitive advantage.
What was bad for conservatives as a general matter, therefore, was
good for GMUSL, allowing it to move up the ranking by exploiting a
considerable market failure. Steve Eagle argues that

people who were interested in law and economics and people who might have
had a libertarian perspective on the world that was congenial to the rest of the
faculty were typically not wanted elsewhere. So Mason was able to hire very
high caliber people in its niche while its reputation was still comparatively tentative.
We would never have been able to hire people of comparable quality who
were seen as more mainstream by some, because they would have gravitated to
law schools that were more established. So from a quality point of view we
were able to get the cream of the crop in law and economics, whereas we would
have been seen as an outlier and a new unproven school among the senior people
we would have liked to have gotten in more established places.

The Becker theory of discrimination suggests that discrimination is not a
stable competitive equilibrium, because the nondiscriminator will be able
to take away market share from the discriminator. In the GMUSL case,
this means that the law school’s competitive advantage depends upon the
214 CHAPTER 6

continuing presence of ideological discrimination. As Daniel Polsby, the
current dean of GMUSL, puts it, “Labor markets are sticky, and there are
good reasons for that. We worry every day that what we do is going to
get competed away. It’s all public. There are no secrets, this is a public
institution, everything we do is public unless it’s in the bathroom. They
know as much about it as we do. The problem is not a knowledge problem,
it’s an action problem. It is, ‘Can you get your faculty to do what we
can get our faculty to do in crucial personnel decisions?’ The answer is
usually no.” It is not quite accurate to say that GMUSL is parasitic on
discrimination against fellow legal conservatives. Most of the leaders of
the school believe that the greatest intensity of discrimination in the market
occurs at the initial hiring stage, when the objective merit of candidates
is difficult to determine. GMUSL seeks to push a number of libertarian
conservatives past this initial hiring stage, keeping these young
lawyers in the academic pool until they are able to prove their objective
merit. Polsby claims that

what we want to do is to prepare people to overwhelm the prejudices and foolishness
of the food chain. In the last analysis, it will be hard for schools further
up in the food chain to prefer a plainly worse-qualified over a plainly betterqualified
person. Somebody is out there with thirteen articles and one hundred
citations, you know he or she is dominating somebody with three articles and
twenty-nine citations. We are proponents of moneyball here, and we have a
pretty simple predictive model of productivity here, and it very rarely fails us,
and anybody can use it. Candidly, we’re just smarter about these sorts of things.
. . . We’re not burdened by intolerance for people who have libertarian and
conservative leanings, and we’re not going to discriminate against them. It may
be the case that we would discriminate against people on the left, with socialist
inclination, but of equal talent, but that becomes very theoretical because our
dear friends in the food chain snap those people up.

Given that GMUSL looks for scholars who have been undervalued in
the academic marketplace, faculty attrition is built into the GMU model.
Rather than focusing on retaining faculty, which is financially beyond
GMU’s means, the school supports the mobility aspirations of its faculty,
operating as the minor league for conservative and libertarian law professors.
According to Polsby, “We don’t work on retention, we work on the
opposite. Any time we can move somebody up the food chain, it adds
credibility to the story we’re telling the market about why you should
come here rather than to our competitor to start your career. We’ve got
now to a point where there’s enough evidence for the proposition that
skeptical people are entitled to believe it. . . . I don’t want to hire anyone
here who doesn’t want to become the next Sterling Professor of Law at
Yale.” Another GMUSL professor makes a similar point, observing,
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 215

“What we really specialize in, in recent years, is people who aren’t totally
ripe for the market generally, and they come here two, three, four, five
years and get seasoned and get a research agenda. We get a lot of those
people here, and then they move on.”71 GMUSL seeks, quite openly, to
perform a critical service to the larger conservative movement by increasing
the market value of ideologically sympathetic young law professors.
GMUSL’s leaders believe that providing this public good to the conservative
movement is wholly consistent with their institutional self-interest.
From the point of view of the larger conservative movement, how successful
has GMUSL been? Unlike the Olin programs at elite law schools,
GMU has not lost its ideological distinctiveness as it has grown in prestige.
In addition, while retaining its libertarian character GMU has, by a
number of different measures, improved more than any other law school
in the last quarter-century. As Daniel Polsby suggests, “As a rule, the rank
of schools as measured by the market test doesn’t change. They are really
stable. Our rank has changed; we are able to attract stronger faculty, and
in comparison tests for student’s picking law schools, there’s movement.
Interestingly, there’s very little movement in the reputation numbers that
U.S. News is using since the early 1990s. Those numbers we’ve moved a
little bit in a favorable direction, but very little.” GMUSL ranks considerably
higher on objective measures of research output and student quality
than in reputational surveys, reflecting the stickiness of academic distinction.
For instance, three recent surveys of faculty quality, citations and
scholarly productivity ranked it at number 22, number 23, and number
27 in the country,72 while subjective surveys of faculty quality ranked
GMU slightly lower, but not considerably.73 Of particular interest, no
school in the country showed as great a disparity between objective measures
of faculty quality and U.S. News rankings as GMU.74 This suggests
that either GMUSL’s connection to its parent university, or its libertarian
reputation, has had a significant drag on its reputation in the legal academy.
There is also insufficient evidence to conclude that GMU has been
able to operate as a successful minor league for elite law schools. While
GMU faculty have been hired by Vanderbilt, George Washington, Illinois,
and William and Mary, the school has not yet made a dent in the law
schools that bestow academic distinction. GMUSL’s Todd Zywicki has
visited at Georgetown, David Bernstein at Michigan, and Eugene Kontorovich
at Chicago and Northwestern, but only Kontorovich has yet moved
on to one of these elite law schools.75
This points to the limitations of GMUSL’s original gamble. Because of
the university’s nonexistent national reputation, its administrators were
willing to give Manne substantial leeway to create a law and economics
law school with a clearly libertarian bent. The institutional weakness that
facilitated innovation also limited the school’s ability to compete in law
216 CHAPTER 6

school rankings. That said, there is evidence that the school has considerably
improved the quality of its students. The most recent rankings of
student quality put it at number 31, one spot above the older and betterendowed
law school at Emory that Manne left twenty years ago.76 This
is an impressive achievement, but GMUSL still does not attract students
who can compete for positions in top law firms, clerkships, or the legal
academy.77 GMUSL may influence America’s legal culture in the next decade
through the professional mobility of its young conservative law professors,
but there are few indications that it will do so any time soon
through its students.

Conclusion

Simply measured in terms of the penetration of its adherents in the legal
academy, law and economics is the most successful intellectual movement
in the law of the past thirty years, having rapidly moved from insurgency
to hegemony. The commanding place of law and economics in the modern
legal academy makes it tempting to conclude that this outcome was inevitable.
While there were certainly structural forces that put the wind at the
movement’s back, there can be little question that organizational entrepreneurship
and patronage played a critical role in allowing the law and
economics movement to take advantage of the opportunity provided by
these larger forces.
The law and economics movement went through a series of reasonably
distinct stages on the way to its current status in the American legal academy,
and at each stage patronage and entrepreneurial activity played important
roles. In the beginning, law and economics (with the partial exception
of its application to antitrust) was so far out of the legal academic
mainstream as to be reasonably characterized as “off the wall.” Limited
almost exclusively to law professors who saw in the idea a powerful device
for criticizing government intervention in the economy, the idea
needed an institutional home to protect it until conditions changed. Without
the nurturance of law and economics at Chicago Law School, therefore,
the ground would not have been prepared for its rapid diffusion
when environmental conditions changed.
Moving law and economics’ status from “off the wall” to “controversial
but respectable” required a combination of celebrity and organizational
entrepreneurship. On the one hand, Richard Posner’s sterling establishment
credentials and powerful intellectual gifts meant that he could
not be ignored. No matter how hard Posner’s critics insisted that his arguments
were off the wall, the fact that prestigious liberal legal academics
were arguing with him suggested the opposite. In that sense, Posner
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 217

played the classic role of the intellectual entrepreneur, demonstrating that
the status quo is open to challenge and that an alternative is available.
Manne’s organizational entrepreneurship worked hand in hand with
Posner’s intellectual entrepreneurship and celebrity in moving law and
economics out of the legal academic periphery. A good deal of the resistance
to law and economics came from two sources: unfamiliarity and
ideological stigma. Manne’s programs for law professors overcame unfamiliarity
by equipping academics with the basic concepts of economics,
eliminating the mystery associated with unfamiliar concepts. Those
programs eroded the field’s ideological stigma by creating personal
bonds between the legal academy’s mainstream and law and economics,
and by convincing participants that economics was an ideologically neutral
set of tools. Manne’s programs for federal judges also helped erase
law and economics’ stigma, since if judges—the symbol of legal professional
respectability—took the ideas seriously, they could not be crazy
and irresponsible.
This account suggests the limitations of thinking about intellectual
change through the metaphor of the “marketplace of ideas.” In any market
there are some things that participants simply will not buy and sell
because they are considered immoral or inappropriate for exchange.
Through most of the 1960s, for example, it could barely be said that law
and economics was in the marketplace at all because the market’s normsetters
refused to take it seriously. This points has two implications. First,
the substance of an idea matters in the early development of an intellectual
movement, but mainly through its ability to generate intense commitment
from a small cadre of people willing to bear the disapprobation of the
majority. Second, the early breakthrough of an idea into widespread discussion
is more a function of its respectability than its truth content. Only
after an idea has been treated as appropriate for discussion are its claims
welcomed into the marketplace of ideas and its ideas discussed on the
merits. This is a political and sociological process, rather than the playing
out of the scientific method.
By the time this chapter opened in the early 1980s, law and economics
had entered the marketplace of ideas but was still a distinctly niche player.
The field’s move out of this niche depended on a combination of environmental
and entrepreneurial forces. Changes in the politics of the federal
courts and regulatory agencies, the increasing prestige of market solutions,
and the transformation of corporate law all increased the demand
for law and economics. By the mid-1980s a “tipping point” was reached
in which the prestige and relative position of elite law schools—the arbiters
of distinction for legal education as a whole—became associated with
the presence of a substantial law and economics program. Having become
218 CHAPTER 6

so associated, the law and economics trend filtered down to those lower
in the legal education pecking order.
While these factors were certainly important in the rise of law and economics,
the speed and depth of its absorption into legal education required
agents capable of turning these opportunities into outcomes. Law
and economics was given substantial financial support from corporations
and foundations, in a way that no other conservative legal movement
was. This was not because movement patrons, particularly foundations,
were especially enthusiastic about law and economics, but because it
seemed to have substantial momentum as well as the potential to be useful
to the broader movement. Especially in elite legal education, these patrons
provided strategic coordination and leadership as well as funding. Law
and economics also attracted a handful of extremely able and enthusiastic
organizational entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs chose to invest their
time in producing human capital in the form of their students, social capital
in the networks that were a by-product of their intellectual activity,
and cultural capital through their success in building a legitimate, respected
place for conservatives in elite institutions. These entrepreneurs
and their conservative patrons worked hand in hand, despite the fact that
their goals were, in important ways, quite different.
In the process of moving law and economics from the periphery to the
core of legal academia, however, the movement changed in important
ways. The stigma attached to the idea in its early days ensured that its
attraction was limited to legal scholars whose ideological commitments
made them willing to bear a high degree of alienation. It was this very
ideological commitment that attracted patrons like the Olin Foundation
to the movement in the first place. As the stigma on law and economics
disappeared and it moved to a position of considerable distinction in legal
academia, its ideological base expanded accordingly. The movement took
on the ideological and methodological coloration of its parent discipline
of economics, as well as absorbing many of the qualities required for
respectability in elite institutions. The law and economics that has attained
such an impressive status in top law schools is not, in short, the
aggressively free-market faith of the movement’s early days. It might even
be appropriate to say that law and economics is no longer a movement
at all, but a discipline. Given the ideological distribution of the overall
legal professorate, injecting that discipline into the law schools was a significant
victory for conservative patrons like the Olin Foundation, but it
is a victory that has come at a cost in ideological purity.
The GMU law school represents an illuminating alternative to the strategy
of working through existing distinguished law schools. By avoiding
the compromises—both methodological and ideological—that came with
established institutions, Henry Manne was able to build a law school with
L A W A N D E C O N O M I C S II 219

a durable libertarian character. The ideological coloration of the school
allowed it to actively seek to advance the interests of the larger conservative-libertarian
movement, by providing an institutional space in which
scholars out of the legal academic mainstream can develop a scholarly
reputation and move on to higher-status institutions. The question going
forward is whether GMUSL’s place in the intensely status-conscious
structure of legal academia will permit it to effectively serve its ambitious
goals. In short, while the Olin programs’ place in the legal academic establishment
may have limited its ideological coherence, GMUSL’s ideological
coherence may limit its impact on the legal academic establishment.

Conservative Public Interest Law II:
Lessons Learned

THE FIRST GENERATION of conservative public interest lawyers was hobbled
by its failure to adapt to a transformed legal and political system,
one in which the locus of political power had become firmly nationalized,
and where agenda control, policy-specific knowledge, media savvy, appeals
to idealism, and elite networks rivaled grassroots organization and
business power. These early conservative lawyers also failed to learn from
their liberal legal adversaries, instead replicating strategies that had been
effective in other areas but were poorly adapted to the very different terrain
of the law. As a consequence, the conservative public interest law
movement failed in these years, with a few exceptions, to attract skilled,
idealistic, creative young lawyers. Its reactive strategy made it difficult to
set the political and legal agenda.
In contrast, it is impossible to deny the success of the second generation
of conservative public interest law firms. Since their founding in 1991
and 1989, respectively, both the Institute for Justice and the Center for
Individual Rights have established impressive track records of placing significant
cases before the Supreme Court. IJ has successfully defended
Ohio’s school voucher plan before the Supreme Court (in Simmons-Harris
v. Zelman) and challenged New York’s ban on interstate shipment of
wine (in Swedenburg v. Kelly). In spite of losing the argument before the
Supreme Court in Kelo v. New London, IJ has effectively used the case to
raise the salience of the issue and put eminent domain restrictions on
the legislative agenda in statehouses across the country. CIR reached the
Supreme Court with major, precedent-setting cases even earlier. CIR’s
challenges to the constitutionality of affirmative action in university admissions
in Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger succeeded in limiting
the use of preferences in undergraduate admissions, and came within
one vote of eliminating them in law schools. Just as important were CIR’s
challenges to restrictions on academic speech and its victories in Rosenberger
v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a landmark
religious liberty case, Reno v. Bossier Parish School District, which restricted
the use of race in local redistricting, and United States v. Morrison,
where CIR successfully argued that provisions of the Violence
Against Women Act exceeded Congress’s power under the commerce
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 221

clause. Despite the millions of dollars that conservative patrons invested
in first-generation firms, none of them came close to this record of winning
important, precedent-setting cases.
While changes in the composition of the federal courts were certainly
important in explaining this record of success, just as critical were the
lessons that conservative organizational entrepreneurs drew from the failure
of first-generation firms, and from the success of their liberal counterparts.
The second-generation firms had clearer, more forthrightly libertarian
principles than their first-generation predecessors. These principles
gave CIR and IJ distance from traditional conservative interests like business
and a willingness to draw on the rhetoric, strategies, legal precedents,
and belief in an affirmative role for the courts created by legal liberals. In
addition, CIR and IJ were led by authentic members of a conservative
“new class”: products of a new constellation of conservative institutions
committed to a set of ideological principles rather than corporate interests.
The changing profile of conservative public interest law’s leaders
went hand in hand with the growth of the Federalist Society and the rising
number of conservatives in the legal academy. Conservatives were increasingly
led not by representatives of the movement’s core constituencies,
but by those with the cultural, social, and human capital essential to the
peculiarities of legal politics. This shift became possible as a result of the
increasing prominence and sophistication of conservative foundations.
The movement’s patrons had been burned by the failure of the first-generation
firms but were primed for alternatives by the Horowitz Report and
by Chip Mellor’s Center for Applied Jurisprudence project. When firms
like IJ and CIR emerged that reflected what the movement had learned
from its first, dispiriting fifteen years, foundation patrons were ready and
willing to give them long-term support.
The second-generation firms were guided by a shared set of lessons
about the conditions for effective legal change, in particular the importance
of agenda control. Where the previous generation of conservatives
had insisted on “judicial restraint,” CIR and IJ had learned that conservative
interests could only be protected by actively using courts to establish
new or reinvigorate old rights, rather than simply standing in the way of
the activism of the Left. Having established distance from business and
shifted their strategy to initiating action in the courts, CIR and IJ had the
freedom to choose an eclectic group of clients: small businessmen, local
property-owners, consumers, students, professors, and racial minorities.
This new, more strategic approach to client selection allowed CIR and IJ
to pick cases with the potential to alter the nation’s constitutional debate,
transform the reputation of the conservative movement, and place significant
opportunities for legal change before the courts.
222 CHAPTER 7

Despite their substantial strategic similarity, CIR and IJ have widely
divergent approaches to personnel, case selection, ground-level legal tactics,
organizational ethos and presentation, and finances. Considered one
by one, these differences may seem minor. Yet together, they constitute
deep differences in organizational culture, which explain CIR and IJ’s
case selection, their relationship with the larger conservative movement,
their willingness to invest in recruitment and training, and their capacity
to sustain themselves over the long term.
Despite their impressive success, conservative public interest law firms
face substantial constraints in their ability to reshape the law and American
legal culture. Some of these constraints are rooted in the structure
of American politics and society, while others are internal to the conservative
movement itself. In particular, conservative public interest law
continues to be dependent on the progress of the larger conservative
program to transform the legal profession. Until conservatives, operating
through organizations like the Federalist Society, have succeeded
in fully integrating themselves into the legal profession—especially the
nation’s law schools—and integrated public interest practice more fully
into their professional lives, the success of conservative public interest
law firms will be limited.

Creating the Center for Individual Rights

Opening its doors in 1989, the Center for Individual Rights was the first
conservative public interest law firm to emerge from the reevaluation of
the field that began with Michael Horowitz’s report a decade earlier.
CIR’s founders, Michael Greve and Michael McDonald, had worked in
first-generation conservative law firms, and this experience, along with
their close study of the liberals’ legal strategies, shaped the design of CIR.
The founding of CIR was not driven by a sudden change in the opportunity
structure. Rather, a window of opportunity had been open for more
than a decade, as the judiciary became more conservative, conservative
lawyers populated the Justice Department, and the movement’s organizational
density increased. The creation of CIR is best understood as an
“inside story,” driven primarily by learning within the movement rather
than stimuli in the political environment.
CIR’s founders had been important players in the evolution of the
conservative legal movement. Before coming to Washington, Greve received
a PhD in political science at Cornell University, where he studied
under Professor Jeremy Rabkin, an aggressive, take-no-prisoners conservative
and a critic of the judiciary’s role in the political process. Rabkin
argued that special interest groups and the judiciary had cooperated to
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 223

expand the meaning and force of statutes, achieving political outcomes
that they no longer had the electoral power to legislate. Legal liberalism,
Rabkin argued, had corrupted constitutional norms while claiming high
constitutional principle.1 Greve and Rabkin (who was a founding member
of CIR’s board of directors) believed that the high moral tone taken
by special interests on the left was simply a cover for undemocratic,
illiberal transfers of resources conducted through constitutionally illegitimate
means. This overriding sense of liberal hypocrisy became powerfully
stamped on CIR’s organizational culture and communications
style, and it gave the firm an edgy quality altogether lacking in most firstgeneration
firms.
While much of CIR’s edgy organizational style drew on Greve’s and
Rabkin’s critiques of legal liberalism, its legal strategy drew primarily on
McDonald’s experience at the Washington Legal Foundation and its spinoff,
the American Legal Foundation. For McDonald, WLF was a model
for CIR’s founders of how such a firm should not be run. McDonald
recalls that, in his experience there,

one day you’d be working on death penalty briefs, the next you’d be working
on environmental law, the day after you’d be working on some qui tam action,
the day after that you’d be working on separation of powers. There was no
rhyme or reason. A lot of it was amicus work; a lot of it was driven by the
perpetual need for fund-raising. . . . A lot of these organizations felt they had
to develop large in-house staff, which is what elevated the fund-raising to such
a key element. . . . They’d have three or four attorneys and four people doing
fund-raising, so you’d have to have a million or two million just to run the
place. You didn’t have a lot of money left over to do actual litigation.

The lost opportunities were not more than theoretical, as the case of CIR’s
first client demonstrated.

When I was at ALF . . . Tom Lamprecht came knocking on my door. He had
been denied a radio license because—I kid you not—he was a man, and spent
his life savings hiring a D.C. regulatory firm to litigate in front of the FCC. The
case was great from every conceivable point of view—and it was a winner. But
I was told we didn’t have money to litigate it in court. I told Tom that if I ever
started a law firm he should see us. He did, and we eventually won.2 . . . [When
CIR began] it was the only case we had, and it could have been WLF’s. But,
again, the thinking there was: it’s just another affirmative action case and we’re
already “doing” those types of cases (i.e., filing amicus briefs in other people’s
cases) and getting as much bang for the buck from our donors as we can. . . .
From the viewpoint of WLF, its overhead and expenses—it did vast amounts of
direct mail in those days—it made no economic sense. You wouldn’t reap any
extra financial good from taking on Lamprecht, and it would have prevented
224 CHAPTER 7

the attorney who took it from writing, I don’t know, six amicus briefs for the
same amount of time that could posture WLF as being in six other important
areas of the law.3

Similar to Chip Mellor’s experience at the Mountain States Legal Foundation,
WLF frustrated McDonald’s desire to engage in serious, strategically
sophisticated public interest lawyering. This professional frustration,
along with a desire to achieve conservative goals, spurred the search for
a new kind of conservative public interest law firm.
Studies of movement investments in public interest law by Horowitz
and CAJ had primed conservative patrons for the new approach that
Greve and McDonald were proposing. Greve recalls that foundations
were especially open to new forms of legal activism. “Foundations at the
time were predisposed toward this. [We said,] ‘Here’s a better model...
that reflects the insights of the Horowitz Report and the current thinking
about this. There is significant start-up time on these things, so give us
two or three years to try this out, this different model, and if it succeeds
it’s cool. If it doesn’t, we’ll be the first to tell you . . . and then we’ll just
shut our doors.” In a conscious echo of the Horowitz Report, CIR’s
founders told their patrons, “Over the past fifteen years, foundations,
corporations, and individuals have invested substantial sums of money in
the conservative, free-market public interest law movement. On the
whole, the return on that investment has not been great. Despite some
notable success stories . . . the public interest law movement has, with
few exceptions, failed to bring about meaningful and lasting legal
change.”4 The cause of this failure was that “original litigation is the only
effective way to change the direction of the law. With some exceptions,
however, conservative, free-market law firms have initiated and litigated
far fewer cases than liberal law firms of comparable size.”5 Drawing on
the political science that Greve had cut his teeth on in graduate school and
the experience of McDonald at WLF, CIR’s founders traced conservative
firms’ reluctance to bring original litigation to the political economy of
organizational maintenance.6 CIR claimed that

public interest law firms can successfully change the law, but only if they are of
a certain size; they must be large enough to employ many attorneys, and they
must maintain large enough administrative and support staffs to allow their
attorneys to perform trial-level litigation. However, if a law firm reaches that
size, Horowitz observed that it will also need to develop a budget in excess of
one million dollars in order to cover its overhead costs. But since money is
scarce, that firm will find itself in a constant struggle to avoid running a deficit.
Many public interest groups are therefore driven into making either one of two
choices: (1) to cut staff, avoid original litigation, and file cost-saving, but largely
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 225

ineffectual, amicus briefs; or (2) to maintain a large legal staff and reluctantly
channel a sizeable portion of their budgets away from litigation and into nonstop
fund-raising activities. Hence the increasing ineffectiveness of many litigation
groups to effectuate meaningful legal reform.7

Part of the solution to this problem was specialization. This conclusion
was based on the failures of the first-generation firms and a reevaluation
of the strategies of their foes on the left. Greve recalls that the crucial flaw
of first-generation firms was

that they were general-purpose firms. It was based on the misperception that
Ralph Nader had succeeded because he was a loud-mouth and had an opinion
on everything. But that was actually not how he operated. It was actually a
bunch of firms that are very highly specialized. Non-Nader funds on the left
operated on the exact same principle—a very high degree of specialization and
a lot of competition. . . . So our notion was that you have to have real live
original litigation and you have to be specialized in certain areas . . . You don’t
win by funding amicus briefs and having an opinion on everything.

The founders of CIR recognized what political scientists have subsequently
demonstrated, which is that, by becoming “repeat players” in
specific areas of law, public interest law firms can spread their investment
in developing expertise over a large number of cases. The returns on these
specialized investments are a reputation for expertise, an appreciation for
the strategies of opposing lawyers, a network of outside lawyers and supporting
groups, and credibility with judges.8
The other advantage of small, focused firms is that they can rely on a
handful of individuals and foundations, avoiding the loss of organizational
focus that can come through from maintaining a base of large, lowdollar
donors. In CIR’s case, this strategy also made a virtue of necessity.
“Our only source of money was foundations . . . and we knew that our
natural source of money—the Olins, Scaifes, etc.—wouldn’t give us that
much, so we had to think small.”9 CIR’s financial strategy was also driven
by what Greve and McDonald (like the Capital Legal Foundation before
them) had learned about the dangers of business patronage. The “constant
quest for money has often resulted in a ‘pro-business’ strategy: case
selection and litigation strategy have been driven by fund-raising needs.
On occasion, conservative firms have also defended corporate positions
in violations of free-market principles.”10 CIR’s founders recognized that
the power of public interest law comes from the perception that it is untainted
by “private interests.” Close financial connections to corporations
preclude such a principled public face, creating “a reputation of conservative
public interest law firms as a ‘business front.’ Ralph Nader’s organizations
or environmental groups are widely regarded as ‘the public’s’ au-
226 CHAPTER 7

thentic representatives; conservative public interest law firms have been
denounced as corporate America’s hired guns.”11 Following Horowitz,
CIR’s founders also argued that conservative public interest law firms
needed to demonstrate their public interest credentials by finding liberal
“entrenched interests” to accuse of hypocrisy, secrecy, and conspiring
against the public.
While they were critical of existing conservative firms, both Greve and
McDonald were open to, and, because of their professional and academic
background, fully capable of, learning from legal liberals. As McDonald
remembers, “The ideas [behind CIR] came from rejecting what we’d seen
on the right and imitating what we thought the Left was doing—whether
it was [is] a different matter. I guess we thought that Alan Morrison of
Public Citizen was a good model. You’d never hear from him for a while,
and then he’d pop up with an INS v. Chadha or something at the Supreme
Court. He didn’t seem to have much of a staff either.” Conservatives
needed to go beyond standing in the way of lawyers like Morrison and
instead mimic them by seizing control of the legal agenda to establish
rights of their own that could be used against institutions controlled by
liberals.12 By initiating cases and thereby controlling the legal agenda, CIR
could shape the facts and venue of cases, influence public perceptions, and
force liberals onto the defensive by making them look like the defenders of
an unaccountable status quo.
CIR believed that they could have a large impact despite their small size
by leveraging the services of lawyers in private practice. The experience of
liberal public interest firms had shown that “many small groups have been
very effective in litigation because they make extensive use of existing
‘free’ resources—most prominently, the pro bono service of for-profit law
firms. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, Trial Lawyers for Public
Justice, and the—of course much larger—ACLU fit this description.”13
CIR would mimic these organizations by identifying cases and shaping
strategy while farming out the heavy lifting (and costs) to pro bono litigators
in wealthy private firms. This strategy depended on networks and
resources that had not existed a decade before. McDonald recalls, “We
thought that what with the influx of talented Reagan-era attorneys back
into private practice, and through the Federalist Society, we had a great
pool of talent to draw on to fit case to attorney.” Federalist Society meetings
would create opportunities to “solicit information and advice about
cases and issues that fit the Center’s agenda.”14 For an organization that,
at least initially, would only have two full-time staff members, the ability
to draw upon a large, geographically dispersed network to help find cases
was essential. What is more, the Federalist Society network made it easier
to identify lawyers ideologically attuned to CIR’s mission and skilled in
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 227

particular areas of law. The Federalist Society, in effect, reduced the transaction
costs of conservative public interest law. Just as important as the
Federalist Society network was the existence of a pool of conservative
lawyers with experience in government and a taste for doing policy-relevant
legal work. CIR’s hope was that once these lawyers went back into
private practice, they would seize the opportunity to continue working on
cases as interesting as those they had been responsible for in government.
Inducing Reagan administration veterans to partner with CIR would
allow the conservative movement to leverage the substantial resources of
private firms for conservative legal activism. Over the years, CIR has in
fact been able to draw very successfully on these Reagan alumni, including
Theodore Olson and Douglas Cox of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, Michael
Carvin of Cooper, Carvin and Rosenthal, and Michael McConnell.15
This points to the important, and generally overlooked, mechanism of
electoral success feeding back into the development of a legal support
structure, through creating an “alumni” pool of former public servants
whose work in government provides the skills, networks, and temperament
for legal activity outside government. But the creation of a cadre of
experienced lawyers as a consequence of electoral success is only onethird
of the equation. For this revolving door to spin effectively, the conservative
movement needed organizations like the Federalist Society to
connect alumni to causes and groups like CIR to activate this “latent
resource” for political action. These factors allowed CIR to maintain a
lean, low-cost firm dependent primarily on foundation support and a
small group of individual supporters, rather than mass mailings and corporate
largesse.
The emergence of a new generation of wealthy libertarians in the technology
and finance sectors also helped CIR reconcile its funding needs
with its strategic ambitions. Changes in the economy also helped CIR
solve its organizational maintenance problems. First-generation firms
depended heavily on funding from corporations (and their owners or
senior management) in areas (such as ranching, extractive industries,
and manufacturing) that were severely impacted by the new regulatory
state and the Naderite firms who knew how to exploit it. By the late
1980s, entirely new sources of wealth had emerged, especially in high
technology, and the result was a sizable number of very wealthy, relatively
young, temperamentally libertarian donors.16 As Greve argues,
“The first generation played in the old economy, second generation in
the new, with lots of rich, individual donors. I don’t mean millionaires,
I mean people who can write a six-figure check the way you or I buy
bagels.” These newly wealthy individuals were looking for opportunities
to invest their money in organizations that shared the libertarian im-
228 CHAPTER 7

pulses that (at least in the late 1980s and early 1990s) characterized
entrepreneurs in areas like software and the Internet. “The biggest contributors
found us, sometimes based on news articles they’d seen, because
they wanted to invest in this ‘sector’ and had asked around for
worthwhile outfits. I did virtually no donor prospecting.”17 When combined
with supportive foundations, a handful of very large individual
donations from new economy millionaires were sufficient to fund CIR’s
lean organizational model. These new economy libertarians were unlikely
to compromise CIR’s legal strategy, since they were attracted to
the firm primarily by its sharply defined ideological principles.
Finally, CIR aimed to mimic the Left in its relationship with the academy.
An early planning document argued that

liberal public interest law firms cooperate closely and in various ways with leading
academic scholars. As a result, they have been able to gain access to legal
and scientific expertise, to develop feasible litigation strategies; to secure a large
amount of credibility in public policy forums and in court; and to draw upon
a steady stream of talented law school graduates who will work for the firms.
The conservative, free-market public interest law movement’s connections to
academic scholars have, on the whole, been rather tenuous. We are convinced
that this is a serious weakness. Accordingly, the Center for Individual Rights
maintains close contacts with legal scholars in the academic community. . . .
Academic advisors are asked to identify potential litigation issues and to formulate
a corresponding litigation strategy for the Center to pursue in court. They
also give advice to the attorneys who litigate the Center’s cases.18

CIR’s intentions to disconnect conservative public interest law from business
interests and to tie it to conservatives in the academy and the think
tank community were two sides of the same coin. CIR’s founders shared
the growing sense of many libertarian conservatives that, with a few exceptions,
businessmen could not be counted on to pursue the interests of
a free market. Indeed, they were all too ready to cut deals with the activist
state in the interest of their short-term bottom line.19 Business was neither
interested in the broader constitutional norms that protect free markets
nor concerned about the social institutions that safeguard those markets.
Conservative intellectuals, Federalist Society members, and conservative
foundations—all based in or connected to the academy—shared the second-generation
legal entrepreneurs’ concern for the larger constitutional
order, and could thus constitute the new “base” for conservative public
interest law. This shift reflected the increasing autonomy of the conservative
movement, a shift Horowitz had pointed to a decade earlier. This new
cadre of Reagan-era conservative activists sought organizational forms in
which they, not business, would hold the movement’s strategic reins.

CIR’s Strategic Opportunism

CIR’s core commitments were to a method of organizing public interest
law activism, a broad critique of the administrative state, and a set of
roughly libertarian principles rather than to any particular area of law
or public policy. While the Institute for Justice established very detailed
litigation strategies even before the organization was founded (through
the Center for Applied Jurisprudence), CIR adopted a market model of
issue selection. Like the early NAACP, CIR’s case selection was characterized
by strategic opportunism: pursuing a range of theoretically attractive
options and then throwing itself behind those that demonstrated traction
in the courts and within their organizational network.20 This opportunistic
approach was itself opportunistic, in the sense that it was not the result
of careful, advance planning, but was a response to feedback from the
legal environment.
CIR attracted attention and developed a network early on, causing a
stream of potential litigants to present themselves to the organization.
The founders developed an ability to recognize cases with substantial legal
potential (drawn from the cases they had induced to come through the
door) that fit within the organization’s general interests. That is, rather
than planning, CIR emphasized case attraction and strategic sorting. As
McDonald recalls,

All—let me repeat—all of the CIR cases that made it to the Supreme Court
had an element of pure fortuitousness to them. . . . Ron Rosenberger went to a
number of other PILFs before he came to us. They turned him down. Maybe
because of, let’s call it, the WLF-Lamprecht problem.21 We were clever enough
to see the case’s potential and wanted to litigate in that area, but it wasn’t as
though we designed the case through theory first and then “created” or found
Ron Rosenberger. . . . We got into the VAWA [Violence Against Women Act]
Morrison case because John Jeffries—the UVA law prof who argued Rosenberger—thought
we were decent guys and when some local practitioner in Virginia
called him for help in Morrison, because he didn’t know about VAWA he
said call CIR. Again, we didn’t create Morrison. . . . And we got into the Bossier
redistricting case because the attorney from Louisiana who had been handling
it had heart problems. He consulted a federal judge who thought well of CIR
and said why not call them. . . . [Our approach was to] be opportunistic—if a
Lamprecht or a Rosenberger walks through the door and you see that their
cases fit within one of your mission areas. Bossier fit within our mission area
of race neutrality but was a bit more of a stretch perhaps, but you don’t pass
up an opportunity to argue before the Supreme Court. Doing that helps generate
more potential cases. In the meantime, sure, we thought about what the
next “logical” case would be to achieve x, y, or z in one area of another,
230 CHAPTER 7

but . . . the only area where we could really design a strategy was in the area of
race preferences. There we had our pick because no one else would litigate them
for all sorts of reasons.

CIR embraced opportunism because, having tried both opportunism and
planning as a mode of organizational agenda-setting, opportunism
worked. McDonald recalls that “we thought of litigating against federal
regulatory agencies . . . but it was next to impossible to find clients. We
thought of doing environmental cases, but, again, [it was] difficult to find
clients not already swept up in mega-Superfund litigation or some other
kind of litigation. . . . Greve wrote a book on environmental law and
could think up all sorts of cases, but none of them worked in practice.”
This pattern of issue opportunism helps to explain the areas of legal
activism CIR pursued as well as those it dropped. The fortunes of four
issues illuminate CIR’s evolving strategic focus. Despite strong initial interest,
CIR dropped two of those issues—legal reform in institutions serving
the disadvantaged and libel law—from its organizational agenda
while aggressively pursuing two others, academic free speech and affirmative
action (both of which are discussed in the next section).
While it was not part of its original grant proposals, CIR began designing
a “Social Responsibility Project” shortly after it was created. This
initiative was designed to use strategic litigation to “improve the functioning
of schools and public housing agencies that serve the poor” and “support
policies and institutions conducive to individual responsibility, self
reliance, and a sense of social obligation”22 The initiative dovetailed with
then-Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp’s emphasis
on “empowerment” of the poor and the first Bush administration’s
interest in education reform.23 The project focused on school discipline
and safety in public housing, with CIR taking the side of local “empowerment-oriented”
organizations who wanted the government to have
more authority and discretion. As McDonald recalls, “We had a law clerk
working on this full time to contact these types of groups—trolling for
potential clients with legal problems to see if we could help with so-called
empowerment.” This was a far cry from the cases that would later make
CIR’s name, all of which attacked government discretion in the name of
individual rights.
While the Olin Foundation funded the project for one year and CIR
was able to enlist the help of organizations such as the National Association
of Secondary School Principals and the National School Safety Center,24
the firm ultimately abandoned the project. Greve recalls that the
Social Responsibility Project “was in fact connected to Kemp’s ownership
initiatives, which also bombed, and for the same reason: lack of
client competence. Plus, the distinction conservatives want to draw be-
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 231

tween ‘law-abiding’ public housing residents and ‘lawbreakers’ is illusory,
since every law-abiding resident has a half-dozen lawbreaking relatives
and doesn’t want the book thrown at them. We spent a long time
advising folks in HUD’s flagship projects (e.g. Trenton) with little to
show for it.”25 The Social Responsibility Project was a bad fit for CIR’s
organizational form, because of “the complexity and sheer mess of those
types of situations. There really is no one target, but fifty different moving
legal targets—nothing for you to get your arms around.”26 Practical
experience and the firm’s design impelled CIR to seek out relatively simple,
potentially precedent-setting cases with a clear path to the Supreme
Court rather than fighting rearguard efforts with geographically limited
impact. The temperament of CIR’s founders was also a poor fit with the
slow, time-consuming demands of building credibility with representatives
of the poor and racial minorities. While such cases might have made
sense for an organization with a large staff, budget, and PR apparatus—
as IJ would soon demonstrate—they made little sense for a firm with
CIR’s organizational commitments.
Despite McDonald’s strong interest in libel law, rooted in his previous
work at WLF and ALF, the issue was also dropped when it failed to bear
fruit. CIR did develop a case in the area early on, Krauser v. Consumer
Reports, which offered “an opportunity to test a ‘no-fault’ theory of libel,
which would permit libel plaintiffs seeking solely a retraction (and no
damages) to escape the overly demanding ‘actual malice’ standard of New
York Times v. Sullivan.”27 CIR took on other libel cases over its first few
years, representing conservative movement figures like S. Fred Singer and
Dinesh D’Souza, but this line of work quickly fizzled out. The most important
constraint, according to McDonald, was that, “unlike the area
of racial discrimination, the playing field was woefully tilted toward the
defense bar, and the Supreme Court wasn’t going to budge.” Even more
important, by taking on the issue of “academic freedom” CIR found a
new outlet for its interest in the First Amendment, but on the side of
expanding the reach of constitutionally protected speech, rather than constricting
it
The failure of the Social Responsibility Project and libel law reform
helped to point CIR, both tactically and ideologically, toward a marked
libertarianism in its caseload. Both libel law reform and the Project had
more in common with traditional conservatism than they did with libertarianism,
in that they sought to limit liberty in the name of a higher
principle, such as individual reputation or school and neighborhood
order. Current CIR president Terry Pell believes that traditional conservatives
face systemic constraints in pursuing these objectives through public
interest law, in a way that libertarians do not. “The courts [have] limited
the ability of institutions to act in a deliberate and effective manner. . . .
232 CHAPTER 7

Courts are most naturally used as a way to limit the executive branch, or
institutions in general. And the laws are all set up as limits on the government.
So if you’re a public interest law firm using the courts, you’re likely
using laws that were designed to limit institutional authority in some way.
That would all push you against any systematic effort to strengthen the
prerogatives of institutions.” The failure of the Social Responsibility Project
and libel law reform provides an intriguing explanation for the greater
success of CIR and IJ, which identified with opposition to, rather than
defense of, government authority. Libertarians were able to work with
the trend in American law initiated by liberals to strip executive institutions
of discretion and force them to operate in accordance with clear,
national rules or professional standards.28 It is important to remember,
however, that CIR’s libertarian focus was an emergent, not a founding,
commitment. Though McDonald and Greve were less committed libertarians
than IJ’s founders were, their interaction with the legal environment—combined
with their temperamental instinct for going where the
action was—gradually pushed CIR in a libertarian direction.29 This is another
example of how the conservative legal movement was shaped by
the liberal legal system that it simultaneously sought to dislodge.

Issue Opportunism at CIR: Free Speech and Affirmative Action

Recognizing the futility of using conservative public interest law to support
governmental authority, however, pointed to the solution—attacking
institutions controlled by the Left on the basis of fundamental constitutional
principles, such as the First Amendment’s rights of free speech and
religion and the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of the equal protection
of the laws. “What we learned,” Greve recalls, “is that public interest
law works when you can wield a big constitutional club. On any other
issue, the regulatory state will eat you alive.” Universities provided a
happy hunting ground for such cases, and also allowed CIR to adopt a
posture of defending individuals against large, oppressive organizations,
and to do so by using constitutional claims that liberals had pioneered.
The opportunity for this new avenue for conservative litigation was the
“political correctness” scare of the early 1990s, which provided a powerful
cultural hook for CIR’s litigation and alerted potential conservative
donors to the importance of countering the campus Left.
CIR’s founders knew from the start that specialization was vital, but
lacked a clear sense of what their organization’s specialty should be. The
arrival of the “PC craze” solved its problem. McDonald recalls, “Initially,
we only asked for two years of funding from foundations, on the assumption
that we’d either find our ‘niche’ or not, in which case we’d close up
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 233

shop. But then the PC craze hit and we’d found a niche. It hadn’t been on
our radar screen when we started CIR but it did fit within our core mission
of protecting free speech and civil rights. We modified and adapted.” CIR
had no long-term litigation strategy in the area, but developed one in
response to the cases that came in the door. “We had no idea that PC was
going to be as big as it was. No idea whatsoever. When Tim McGuire
walked into our office with the flap about admission records at Georgetown
Law Center, we were floored when it ended up on the front pages
of the Washington Post and the New York Times, and that was just the
start of all sorts of other similar cases.”30 CIR had found a niche that
matched the substantive interests and temperament of the organization’s
leaders, as well as their strong links with academia.
Sensing that attacking censorship on campus was both substantively
important and appealing to donors and the larger conservative movement,
CIR quickly formalized its work in the area into an Academic
Freedom Defense Fund. An early planning paper for the AFDF makes
clear that CIR had a clear sense that there was a need and a political
opportunity in the area, as well as an issue likely to generate excitement
from donors.

Uniformly, our “advisors” argued that the establishment of an Academic Freedom
Defense Fund (AFDF) is an idea whose time has come. We share this assessment
for both substantive and, as it were, tactical reasons. As to substance, the
“PC” movement is a genuine menace, and the protection afforded to conservative
and middle-of-the-roadish students and academics by organizations such
as the ACLU and the AAUP is insufficient and, shall we say, unreliable. As to
tactics, Aaron Wildavsky has remarked that the “PC” movement is really the
first issue that has split the Left on campus. This opportunity should be exploited:
the more of a wedge we can drive between heretofore closely aligned
leftist constituencies, the better.31

While the AFDF was clearly motivated by a genuine desire to defend
the rights of (predominantly conservative) academics, Greve’s comment
shows that it was also seen as part of the “war of position” in the modern
university between liberals and conservatives. The founders of CIR sincerely
believed that efforts to limit the speech of those on the right were
real and designed to shut off challenges to academic liberalism. For conservatives,
campus politics was simply politics by other means in a different
venue. Defending themselves required coalition-building strategies designed
to split moderate liberals from those to their left, strategies that
conservatives were deploying with increasing regularity in areas like
school choice and welfare reform.32 Attacking political correctness also
had the advantage of attracting conservatives willing to donate their labor
to the cause—a substantial advantage given CIR’s dependence on outside
234 CHAPTER 7

counsel. The proposal for the AFDF noted that “CIR has received far
more requests for cases in this than in any other area of activities.”33 Finally,
the issue attracted substantial interest and consequently free public
relations from the larger conservative movement. Conservative magazines
loved stories about political correctness on campus, and publishers were
recognizing that books on “liberal bias” in academia had a market.34 Ever
on the lookout for areas in which they could leverage free resources, academic
free speech emerged as a clear winner.
Racial and gender preferences in education were not a focus of CIR’s
early strategy documents, and the firm shied away from the issue in its
early years. In its original proposal for the AFDF, CIR made clear that
affirmative action was freighted with danger, because of the intrinsic difficulty
of winning cases in the area and because of the tensions it might
produce with its potential allies.

In our opinion, the AFDF should limit itself strictly to cases and controversies
that have a bearing upon academic freedom and First Amendment rights. In
particular, the AFDF should not get sidetracked into issues of related, but ultimately,
quite different concern—most notably, race, including racial quotas in
student admission and faculty hiring and promotion. When we discussed this
with several of our “consultants,” we received mixed reactions. Some advisors
viewed race- and gender-based hiring, promotion, and admissions as the problem
for conservative academics, and they urged that the envisioned AFDF provide
legal assistance to victims of racial discrimination. Of course, racial and
gender preferences do abound in higher education. Discriminatory policies are
the source of many of the complaints and inquiries we receive (and would receive
in larger numbers if the AFDF were established). Nonetheless, we believe
that the AFDF should refrain from devoting its resources to reverse discrimination
cases, at least as a general rule. First, “Title VI” and “Title VII” civil rights
cases are exceedingly difficult and expensive. The proof problems are almost
always daunting, and litigation costs run into hundreds of thousands of dollars
for most cases. Second . . . the vigorous advocacy of First Amendment rights
and academic freedom has the potential of driving a wedge between heretofore
united political constituencies. This potential might be lost if the AFDF were
perceived, not as a “civil libertarian” organization but, rightly or wrongly, as
simply yet another conservative hobby horse.35

Appealing to nonconservatives was central to CIR’s political strategy of
splitting the Left, and explains why it went out of its way to explain to
foundations its hesitation in pursuing affirmative action cases. “In order
to attain their broader political and philosophical objectives, conservatives
and moderates must seek to cooperate with non-radicalized liberals
on issues on which both sides, for all their disagreements, happen to agree;
and the defense of academic freedom is first and foremost among these
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 235

issues. In this way, an Academic Freedom Defense Fund might contribute
to a productive political ‘realignment’ on college campuses.”36
Just a few years later CIR reversed itself and began filing the cases that
led up to its Supreme Court challenges to affirmative action in Gratz and
Grutter. What explains this rapid strategic shift? First, CIR had already
nosed its way into the question of affirmative action in the Lamprecht
challenge to FCC radio license policies and its free speech cases challenging
university interpretations of their antidiscrimination duties. But the
jump to a direct attack on affirmative action in university admissions
threatened the support CIR sought to attract from centrists and liberals,
might give the firm an unsavory racial stigma, and unquestionably required
a large increase in funding. In its 1993 request for funding from
the Olin Foundation, CIR addressed its previous concerns directly.

When the AFDF was established two years ago, we decided to stay away from
affirmative action and reverse discrimination cases. We believed that AFDF’s
success would depend on its reputation—and practice—as a (civil) libertarian
organization dedicated to free speech and inquiry, and that a preoccupation
with questions of race and gender might interfere with this strategy. In hindsight,
this was the right approach. However, the time has come to revisit the
original decision to stay away from quota cases. First, the AFDF (and CIR in
general) now has developed a reputation as a principled civil libertarian organization.
It can easily afford to take a few high-profile discrimination cases without
blurring its central message. Second, the quotaization of the academy has
continued apace. Unless and until hiring and admissions by numbers are arrested,
all the other items on the agenda for higher education will, in the long
run, be losing causes.37

McDonald believes that CIR’s shift to enthusiasm for affirmative action
litigation had a simpler motivation. The justification in 1993, in McDonald’s
telling, was “a retroactive highfalutin’ attempt to justify the fact
that a really good case involving racial preferences had come our way—
namely Hopwood. . . . Here again, CIR didn’t initiate the case, a local
attorney by the name of Steve Smith did—but we got in touch with him
and looked over the admissions policy and thought, ‘[There’s] no way
we cannot not do this.’ ” In 1991, when the firm was still quite young,
a case like Hopwood would have stretched CIR’s organizational capacity
to its breaking point. “Take away our low (by comparison with what
we could have been making at WLF, say) salaries and overhead and that
doesn’t leave you with much to do more than a few original cases each
year, and, if you do, they’d better not be factually messy—fifty depositions
and the like. We had to wait for the law to change, for the universities
to become more brazen about their use of race . . . and for CIR to
develop a good track record so that we could attract more and more
236 CHAPTER 7

good firms to our cause.”38 By 1993, CIR was convinced that it could
handle one case like Hopwood without outstripping its fund-raising and
organizational capacity.
Another factor that allowed CIR to consider a challenge to affirmative
action was the increasing density of conservative organizations on campus,
the most important of which was the National Association of Scholars.
From the vantage point of its professorial constituency, NAS saw
affirmative action as intimately connected to CIR’s existing agenda of
academic freedom. As Steve Balch, the president of NAS, told Greve
in 1993,

I realize the difficulty of attempting reverse discrimination cases. Nonetheless,

they comprise the largest category of complaints we receive, and are, alas, likely

to remain a growth industry. It’s imperative that we deal with them for two
reasons. First, they drive a lot of our people out of the business (not because
they’re all white males—we’re not; but because reverse discrimination is most
likely to be inflicted on white males who are also “politically incorrect”). Second,
these policies comprise the linchpin of a whole regime of campus governance
inimical to the ideals of liberal education. If, through some legal breakthrough,
reverse discrimination was no longer permitted, university administrators would
be compelled to configure an entirely new set of alliances to support themselves,
drastically transforming the political equation on campus.39

Attacking affirmative action went hand in hand with defending the free
speech rights of conservative professors. Attacking affirmative action
would enhance the probability that conservatives would be hired, while
CIR’s existing free speech litigation would protect them once they made
their way through the university’s gates. As McDonald recalls, “Every
time we’d do an academic case, the client or his colleagues would inevitably
ask us to do race cases. . . . Dr. X would say, you should sue my school,
too, because it has quotas.” In affirmative action, conservatives had an
issue with potentially large popular appeal, a newly vibrant infrastructure
of conservative academics, support from conservative foundations, and a
sense that, due to the hesitancy of Republican lawmakers, the courts were
likely to be the only venue for policy change.40
The reason for the relative absence of effective challenges to affirmative
action was not the dearth of attractive plaintiffs, but the absence of public
interest lawyers interested in representing them. As McDonald recalls,
this gave CIR the space to select clients and venues strategically.

You had legitimately aggrieved plaintiffs a-plenty . . . it was a target-rich environment.
You can’t open any statute book, federal or state, without coming
across some set-aside that has no sound predicate in law. But none of these
groups were willing to touch them because it was very cost intensive and the
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 237

law was evolving. Once we got into this area of law and people found we were
the only game in town, we had our choice of plaintiffs. There are economic
reasons [for the absence of litigation]. For example, it might cost a couple of
thousand dollars to file an amicus brief in the Supreme Court in the Adarand
case, but then you can send out a fund-raising letter that says we filed a brief
with the Supreme Court . . . and we’re working on behalf of Mr. Adarand, even
though they’re not technically representing him.41

The success of CIR was as much a victory of organization as it was legal
strategy or political opportunity. CIR’s predecessors, with a few exceptions,
had been caught in an organizational maintenance trap driven by
dependence on business and unsophisticated direct mail donors. CIR, by
contrast, had chosen an organizational design that limited its financial
needs and allowed it to raise money primarily from a handful of sophisticated
donors who understood its basic approach. This gave CIR the freedom
to focus immediately on litigation and to spread their litigation bets
until they hit on an issue—academic freedom—that worked.
The success of CIR’s academic freedom cases won the firm a high public
profile and enhanced its reputation within the conservative movement.
Having developed a reputation as the scourge of political correctness, CIR
attracted clients who believed their issues were akin to those the firm had
already handled. This specialized reputation allowed CIR to sift through
the “target-rich environment” of clients that came through its door,
choose those with the greatest promise, rapidly test the litigation waters,
and follow up on cases that bore fruit. This is the approach that allowed
CIR to identify and successfully litigate such important, precedent-setting
cases as Morrison and Rosenberger, and eventually led to its challenge to
affirmative action in university admissions.

The Evolution of the Institute for Justice

Unlike CIR, the Institute for Justice’s legal strategy and issue focus were
designed through Mellor’s Center for Applied Jurisprudence (described
in chapter 3) before the organization was up and running. The books
published by CAJ42 provided IJ with an operational design, an approach
to legal activism, and a set of thoroughly vetted legal strategies on specific
issues. IJ’s early planning documents identified economic liberty, educational
choice, property rights, and the First Amendment as its key issues,
and fifteen years later these remain its central commitments. IJ’s history
has been marked by the implementation of a well-established vision, in
sharp contrast to CIR’s opportunistic search for issues capable of providing
legal and political traction.
238 CHAPTER 7

From the moment it opened its doors, IJ was committed to pursuing
libertarian goals by targeting groups typically associated with liberalism.
For example, IJ’s earliest proposals highlighted its pursuit of “economic
liberty” through defending “low-capital entrepreneurs” like a “black
Muslim entrepreneur whose African hairstyling salon is threatened with
closure because Mr. Uqdah does not have a cosmetology license,” as well
as targeting licensing requirements in the taxicab business.43 The same
proposal identified its strategy of representing “low-income parents” in
cases that “will place urban public schools on trial and clearly identify
choice as a low-income empowerment solution.”44 These cases drew on
the work that Bolick had done at the Landmark Legal Foundation,
which built on the arguments of Stuart Butler, Walter Williams, Clarence
Thomas (Bolick’s mentor at the EEOC), and Robert Woodson that economic
growth in the inner cities was being held back by government
regulation, rather than insufficient spending.45 These supporters of “empowerment”
believed that “deregulating the inner city” would give conservatives
political traction among traditional supporters of liberalism,
African-Americans in particular.
The legal theory that accompanied empowerment was that attacking
the impact of state regulation on the poor and racial minorities would
help reinvigorate the property rights provisions of the Constitution. The
line of cases that stood in IJ’s way was, by its own admission, quite long.

We believe it is timely and essential to begin a direct assault on the SlaughterHouse
Cases, which read the privileges or immunities clause out of the 14th
Amendment. Such an assault must unfold as part of a carefully planned, longterm
program to restore constitutional protection for economic liberty. It will
be essential to identify licensing and permitting laws and other governmentcreated
barriers to entry that frame the economic liberty issue most compellingly.
We have high confidence in our ability to do this since we have been very
successful in all of our cases in identifying the best possible factual settings and
the most sympathetic clients.46

These cases had ambitious long-term objectives but quite modest shortterm
aims, which made it difficult to persuade some of IJ’s patrons that
there was a high payoff to its activities, in comparison to those of CIR.
The staff of the Olin Foundation responded to IJ’s initial grant proposal
by observing that “some of the litigation the Institute has started looks
promising, while lawsuits to allow ghetto residents to start shoe shine
or barber businesses are more quixotic.”47 Even today, Olin Foundation
president James Piereson recalls, “I’ve had some mixed views on the other
cases they’ve done, like the street vendors and the licensing stuff. It seems
like small-bore sort of stuff; it’s hard to find what the range and preceden-
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 239

tial value of it is. You get the beauticians freed up in Washington, D.C.,
but its not clear how far you can take it.”
The founders of IJ did not share the Olin Foundation’s skepticism.
From the start, IJ judged that placing poor, black clients against large
government institutions would improve their odds of success in the
courts, magnify their public profile, and help change the reputation of
conservatives and libertarians. By representing clients who were sympathetic
by prevailing liberal standards, IJ could get around the usual assumptions
of the media and courts that conservative lawyers were just
fronts for big business. Representing traditionally liberal clients had the
potential to transform the identification of civil rights with liberalism, and
to remove the stigma of racism from conservatives. Once this identification
had been broken, IJ’s leaders calculated, it would be possible for
conservatives to gain a hearing on a wide range of issues. “Once we make
common cause on an issue like school choice, other pieces of the puzzle,
such as economic liberty and private property rights, seem to follow logically.
. . . Given that our goal is to give people greater control over their
destinies, we should never cede either the moral high ground or the opportunity
to put a human, compassionate face on our philosophy.”48
The most daunting early challenge for IJ was financial, not strategic.
Despite the substantial spadework that Mellor had done to show conservative
patrons the need for an organization like IJ, fund-raising for the
firm was more complex than Mellor anticipated. Mellor was hired by the
Pacific Research Institute to resuscitate the think tank and was uncomfortable
raising start-up funds for IJ from supporters. This meant that IJ had
to solicit support from a single, large contributor to get the organization
off the ground and develop its own funding base.

I needed a seed funder, who was Charles Koch.49 I’d known Charles for a long
time and I thought, “This is just the sort of thing he should like.” I never got to
make a pitch directly to him; I went through some functionaries. [They said no.]
I thought, what are we going to do, who else would give us enough money to be
serious? And I had a really hard time thinking of somebody, when the call came
and said, “We’ve been thinking about it again, and we’d like to listen to what
you have to say.” . . . He said, “Here’s what I’m going to do. I’ll give you up to
$500,000 a year for three years, each year, but you have to come back each
year and demonstrate that you’ve met these milestones that you’ve set out to
accomplish and I will evaluate it on a yearly basis, and there’s no guarantees.”50

The universe of conservative patrons at the time was quite limited, and
the number of those willing and able to make very large contributions was
even smaller. On the other hand, the intimate nature of the conservative
patronage network and their relatively flat organizational structure meant
that Mellor could gain personal access to a deep-pocketed potential
240 CHAPTER 7

contributor based on his own reputation, produced through the network
of conservative and libertarian organizations.
IJ’s earliest grant proposals were of a piece with the strategies developed
at the Center for Applied Jurisprudence. Given the “perilous state” of the
rule of law in America, IJ argued, “It is not enough to depend on academic
discourse or private lawyers to remedy this tragic situation.” Instead,

The inertia in the legal system and its dominance by special interests can be overcome
only through skilled advocacy by individuals armed with philosophically
and tactically consistent strategies based on natural rights and the Constitution.
These advocates must pursue carefully selected cases having significant potential
to set favorable precedent and to provide a compelling platform to argue the
issue in the court of public opinion. Every case should be a building block in a
progression of cases that relentlessly reshapes American jurisprudence.51

This emphasis on strategic litigation was familiar to the conservative patrons
who had supported Mellor’s work at the Pacific Research Institute.
IJ’s early grant applications made sure to recall foundations’ previous
support of CAJ: “Ultimate success depends upon our executing the program
and talent you played such a key role in developing.”52 What was
new was the recognition that conservative public interest law’s problems
went well beyond legal strategy to the underdeveloped state of conservative
legal activism more broadly.

While principled advocacy is essential, it is beyond the province of any one
organization or group of individuals to accomplish all that needs to be done.
Quite simply, there are not enough trained advocates who know how to make
use of the unique tools that our type of public interest law has to offer. Consequently,
a substantial effort must be made to train law students, lawyers, and
policy activists how to apply their talent and idealism in the real world of litigation,
media relations, and public debate. With such training, the talent pool of
effective advocates will be increased dramatically and the chances of ultimate
success will rise immeasurably.53

The solution was to conduct a series of seminars led by IJ staff and major
conservative legal scholars (the grant proposal named Charles Fried of
Harvard, Jonathan Macey of Cornell, and Michael Krauss of George
Mason). The purpose was to overcome the problem that “lawyers, driven
by the demands of private practice, rarely recognize opportunities to advance
principles within the context of their practices.”54 The seminars
would introduce conservative lawyers to the possibilities for pro bono
legal activism and facilitate the “spontaneous, decentralized action” that
libertarians have philosophical reasons to prefer to conscious, centralized
planning. As we shall see later in this chapter, IJ’s high hopes in this area
have not, fifteen years later, been met.
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 241

In spite of its interest in looking beyond the courtroom, the primary
activity of IJ has always been litigation, and unlike CIR it has been remarkably
consistent in the kinds of cases it handles. For instance, IJ has
litigated school choice cases since its founding. In 1992, it sued the Chicago
and Los Angeles schools systems, arguing that their low quality of
instruction violated state constitutional guarantees.55 In these cases IJ accepted
the idea that state constitutions established judiciable standards of
government performance—a position usually associated with legal liberalism—but
claimed that the failure of government argued for allowing
parents to take their percentage of school funding to private schools. This
case convinced the Olin Foundation to fund IJ, because “even if the courts
do not issue injunctions mandating the equivalent of a voucher system,
the publicity of putting urban public education ‘on trial’ would be very
bad news for the defenders of the public education monopoly and its
constant demands for still more money.”56 IJ lost both of these cases,
however, and while it has occasionally used the courts to claim that school
choice was an affirmative state duty, not simply a constitutional option,57
this has ceased to be a major part of IJ’s legal strategy.58 The main purpose
of these cases was to use the law to reinforce IJ’s argument that the public
school system is a source of unaccountable power, and that the interests
of school providers should not be conflated with those of schoolchildren.
Like their liberal predecessors, IJ sought to use the law to change the
framing and salience of political issues.59
IJ’s work in the area of Fifth Amendment takings jurisprudence is an
even clearer instance of how it has used the law as a mobilizing tactic, to
set the political agenda, and to transform public opinion. Mellor recalls
that takings could easily have been seen as a libertarian issue of minor
importance: “All the way along in Kelo [and in other litigation in the
area], we had the challenge to take an issue that we thought was vitally
important, but by its very nature conducted in such a way that it was not
on the radar screen of most Americans. . . . We had to figure out ways to
mobilize people and public outrage around the issue.” For its first step in
framing the issue, IJ could hardly have found a better enemy than Donald
Trump, who had convinced the state of New Jersey to use its power of
eminent domain to condemn a private home to make way for a casino
parking lot.60 IJ won and followed with a series of similar cases, including
a challenge to Pittsburgh’s plan to use eminent domain to make way for
a downtown mall. In that case, IJ never filed a suit, helping instead to
organize local community groups, staging protests, and launching a highprofile
public relations campaign, the centerpiece of which were ten threehundred-square-foot
billboards. The city eventually promised not to use
eminent domain. IJ followed up with a similar mix of legal and nonlegal
tactics in other states, as well as an ambitious program to train local
242 CHAPTER 7

activists. Mellor recalls that IJ “wanted to equip community activists with
the tools to head off eminent domain even before it got to court. That is
in fact what we did through on-line materials, but also through annual
conferences, where we’d bring activists together for the weekend and
teach them everything from organizing techniques, to media relations, to
the legal procedures they could expect.”
IJ finally reached the Supreme Court with a takings case in Kelo v. New
London, where it took on the effort by the Pfizer Corporation and local
government to use eminent domain to make room for the drug company’s
research facility. Kelo is a good example of the strange bedfellows coalitions
that IJ hoped, from its founding, to put together: it was supported
with an amicus brief signed by the NAACP, American Association of Retired
Persons, and Southern Christian Leadership Conference. IJ lost the
case in the Supreme Court, in a five-to-four decision, but was able to
quickly transform legal failure into mobilization success.

When we got the result, I came in the next day and announced that we were
going to launch our “Hands Off Our Home” campaign, which was an evolution
of the Castle Coalition, to take the Kelo decision to the state level, and fight it
there. I said next week we’re going to hold a news conference at the National
Press Club to announce this new campaign, dedicate three million dollars to it.
Fight the battle at the state level, whether it’s through litigation, legislation,
initiative, and try to create greater property rights against eminent domain.61

In addition to attracting large donations from existing donors, the failure
in Kelo led to “several thousand new small dollar donations, and new
activists to the Castle Coalition [IJ’s property rights network].” While
“winning the Kelo case with a resounding victory in the Supreme Court
was the desired outcome” for IJ,62 a narrow, divided or technical victory
might have been worse than failure. As Mellor concludes, “A defeat with
the kind of dissent that we got, is as good as it could possibly be. Not
only has this ignited outrage across the country that will transform the
debate for a long time to come, it will demonstrate the power of citizen
activism on this issue. That’s good for property rights and the democratic
process, and it will leave IJ a much stronger organization as a result of
the skills we’ve acquired doing this.”63 Polls taken after the decision show
that it was resoundingly unpopular (although few respondents were likely
to have substantial information on the issue). Politicians in over half of
the states (as of June 2006) have passed legislation narrowing the use of
eminent domain.64 Legislation on the subject has even been debated in
Congress. Using its newfound fund-raising power on the issue, IJ has
hired staff to “mobilize across the nation in the states where eminent
domain reform is being considered, and to be a catalyst to make sure that
the best possible reform happens.”65
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 243

IJ also used Kelo to expand the range of its organizational capacities.
Kelo produced an outpouring of articles from libertarian law professors,
demonstrating the impact that litigation can have on the scholarly
agenda.66 IJ has used the aftermath of Kelo to build its own research capacities,
creating a Strategic Research Program designed to expand on
the substantial research that it has already produced on eminent domain
“abuse.” IJ told its donors that

the release of Public Power, Private Gain67 gave the Institute for Justice great
momentum moving forward, particularly with our case Kelo v. City of New
London. Groups such as the NAACP have used strategic research for years, but
there is no other group on our side of the ideological spectrum that has come
close to conducting and using research as part of a focused litigation agenda,
especially combined so potently with media relations and outreach components.
Supplementing the work of traditional think tanks, we will produce and
publish studies within our specific areas of concentration and move promptly
to apply such research to our litigation agenda.68

IJ has given the program a $400,000 budget, hired an experienced PhD
policy analyst as director of strategic research, and plans to run conferences,
fund in-house research, and solicit academic articles and shorter
papers that address specific issues that the firm has identified as critical
in making its case before courts, with the public, and among experts. As
far back as the Center for Applied Jurisprudence project, IJ’s leaders
have recognized the importance of coordinating litigation and research,
but the experience of the very fact-intensive takings cases taught the
firm that they needed to be much more deeply integrated. By attracting
attention to these issues, Kelo had the further effect of increasing patrons’
willingness to invest in IJ’s organizational capacities, which will
have an impact on all of its litigation in the coming years.
IJ’s response to the Kelo decision shows that what Michael McCann
has argued about the comparable worth movement also appears true of
conservative litigation: it is possible to win, in the sense of encouraging
popular mobilization and inducing action in venues other than the
courts, by losing.69 IJ’s approach to the outcome in Kelo also casts doubt
on the claim that legal activism is necessarily demobilizing.70 In fact, IJ
has typically used litigation to attract public attention by framing issues
in stark, moralistic ways, helping reshape perceptions of the conservative
movement’s racial goodwill, build coalitions with traditionally liberal
groups, and create emotionally charged events that help build more
permanent forms of political mobilization. None of these are intrinsic
to litigation as a political strategy, and it is certainly possible for lawheavy
political strategies to sap energy from other approaches to politi-
244 CHAPTER 7

cal change. Law has the capacity to mobilize as well as demobilize, depending
on the target of political change and the strategic approach of
legal-organizational entrepreneurs.

Organizational Style and Legitimation in Conservative
Public Interest Law

IJ and CIR came out of the same rethinking of conservative legal strategy,
and extracted many of the same lessons from that experience: specialize;
emphasize original, long-term litigation; appeal to idealism; and
establish distance from business. Despite this common starting point, IJ
and CIR have developed quite distinct organizational cultures, driven
by the attitudes and preferences of their founders, the demands of organizational
maintenance, and the mobilization of staff and patrons. These
different organizational cultures have also influenced the firms’ longterm
prospects.
IJ’s self-presentation is remarkably consistent, both physically and
philosophically. Its Washington, D.C., office is laid out in an open plan
with glass doors, an image that IJ consciously considered in its design.71
The staff’s attitude is strikingly upbeat, optimistic, and allergic to cynicism.
In all my interviews with IJ staff, they combined an attitude of openness
while staying on message, and seemed so motivated by their clients
that the larger legal issues sometimes drifted into the background. This
reflects the infusion of public relations throughout the entire organization:
while IJ has two full-time public relations specialists to shape the
firm’s media strategy, all of its lawyers are expected to consider how its
cases will play in the “court of public opinion.”
IJ’s cases are designed for maximum dramatic impact, typically through
representing a racial minority or low-income person challenging a large
institution, with a great deal of emphasis on the personal dimension of
the case. John Kramer, IJ’s vice president for communications, observes
that its ideal case must have “compelling clients, very simple facts, and
outrageous acts.” IJ’s press strategy reflects its case selection and its emphasis
on the compelling personal stories of its clients. “We make it clear
to reporters that our cases aren’t just about increasing the number of cabs
on the streets in a given city, or about improving the quality of education,
or about sometimes obscure words on parchment that guarantee a right.
Our cases demonstrate real-life human dramas. They are about real people
and their dreams of a better life for themselves and their families.”72
Designing cases in this way allows them to work with the grain of modern
television journalism, which is attracted to legal cases with a sympathetic
individual plaintiff, a deliberate violation of individual rights, and a sim-
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 245

ple causal story.73 One indication of IJ’s success in this regard is that its
school choice and eminent domain cases have been featured on 60
Minutes. IJ’s strategic judgment, in sharp contrast to CIR, is that judges
need to sympathize with their clients and fear a public outcry if they fail
to rule in their favor.74 So, for example, in its school choice litigation IJ
repeatedly brought large numbers of inner-city parents to the courthouse
for important trials, a strategy that may have helped sway at least one
judge in an early, critical trial in Wisconsin.75 Bolick admits that IJ’s emphasis
on “helping the judge want to rule in our favor” through storytelling
and social science evidence “is counterintuitive to many lawyers—
indeed, offensive to some, especially government lawyers, who hate to
hear about the equities—but it is an important part of the American legal
tradition.”76 This approach reflects the lessons that IJ drew from its liberal
predecessors in public interest law.

We borrow heavily and consciously from the Left for our litigation strategies,
mainly from the [NAACP] LDF in its campaign to overturn Plessy. A strategic,
case-by-case, goal-oriented litigation strategy; sympathetic cases . . . and arguing
in the court of public opinion. . . . In the 1980s, I devoured everything I
could find on Thurgood Marshall, MLK, and the civil rights movement. From
Marshall and MLK I derived the insights of setting the terms of the debate,
pursuing a principled incremental, long-term agenda; expressing the cause in
the most universal possible terms, and forging nontraditional alliances.77

In order to break through the public’s instinctive suspicion of conservative
and libertarian claims to speak for the public interest, IJ’s founders
thought it essential to generate sympathy for the organization’s clients,
typically with a simple, direct narrative whose fundamental injustice does
not require a commitment to IJ’s underlying principles.
Perhaps nothing reveals the stylistic differences between the CIR and
IJ so well as the debate on affirmative action. Clint Bolick argues that
“CIR would not think twice about representing a white male who had
said something politically incorrect, in violation of a speech code. . . . We
would. They are more aggressive about taking on political correctness.
We’re more focused on building a case in the court of public opinion.”78
CIR’s current president accepts this distinction:

[IJ] won’t touch a case unless it will promote a certain kind of public debate.
For example, my impression is they will never bring a reverse discrimination
case on behalf of a white plaintiff. . . . It’s an article of faith. . . . The reason for
this is they don’t want to be portrayed in the press as representing disgruntled
white people. They want always to be representing racial minorities in these
kinds of cases. That’s a press strategy that drives their legal strategy, whereas
we’re just the reverse. We find the legal cases we want to bring, and then we
246 CHAPTER 7

figure out how to promote them. We feel that it’s very important in these very
charged issues to speak from a consistent and principled point of view. . . . The
reason they only want to bring these sorts of cases on behalf of African-Americans
is . . . they want to blunt the argument that the other side makes that we’re
racially insensitive. . . . To our way of thinking, that’s just playing racial politics
that we’re opposed to. We will not posture in these cases that way. We will
bring a strong case that we believe represents the legal principle that we think
ought to be strengthened. We’ll go to great lengths to describe that principle in
ways that we think will connect with people. We’re not blind to racial politics.
But we’d never construct a case around our desire to posture against the other
side’s mischaracterization of us, the way IJ would.79

While Pell’s characterization of IJ may be harsh, it does reflect the very
different self-images of the two organizations, and their relationship to
the legacy of Brown. While both reject affirmative action, for instance,
CIR has firmly associated itself with the more minimal “anticlassification”
understanding of Brown, while IJ clearly identifies with the “antisubordination”
tradition that interprets Brown as a call for undoing the
legacy of slavery and segregation.80 CIR legitimates its litigation by reference
to the plain text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, while IJ seeks to embody the broader aspirations of the
civil rights movement. IJ is not simply playing “racial politics,” as Pell
suggests, although they certainly are trying to reshape the public reputation
of conservatism. The leaders of IJ have actually internalized the
loftier aspirations of the civil rights era, aspirations that the leaders of
CIR claim have become a smokescreen to hide the old-fashioned politics
of transfer-seeking.
Until its affirmative action litigation heated up, CIR did not employ any
public relations staff, and, when it did, it hired a lawyer and government
veteran, Terry Pell, rather than the public relations professionals employed
by IJ.81 CIR’s public relations strategy is significantly constrained
by its strategic choice to represent unpopular clients. As Greve argues,
“It’s a challenge if you have innocent but highly suspicious or suspect
clients. It’s a very different skill to handle those sorts of situations properly.
You can’t say, ‘Here’s the client. Isn’t he an admirable person?’ and
we’ll play the equities.” Unable to draw on the attractiveness of their
clients, as IJ has done so skillfully, CIR modeled itself instead on the
ACLU. Jeremy Rabkin, a member of CIR’s board since its founding, argues,
“We liked harrumphing about individual rights, rather abstract
claims where we could say, in the manner of the ACLU, ‘The law is the
law, no exceptions, you must live with it, you who wield authority.’ ”
This was partially a matter of temperament—CIR’s founders would have
found drawing attention to the client’s “story” insufferably sentimental.
It was also a matter of principle, since they believed that policymaking
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 247

through emotional appeals had led to the decline of constitutional formalities
in the first place. As Terry Pell puts it, “We wanted to be what the
ACLU should have been, and was at one point: an uncompromising defender
of civil liberties and individual rights. We wanted to get rid of all
the political litmus tests that the ACLU was beginning to apply to all their
cases, [where there were] clear violations of individual rights that they
wouldn’t litigate because it didn’t serve one of their favored constituencies
or political causes.” CIR’s approach to public relations, according to Pell,
is to develop a reputation for taking cases regardless of the client if an
important principle is at stake, as it did in defending the free speech rights
of Michael Levin, a professor of philosophy at CUNY with odious views
on racial matters.82 CIR gambled that observers of the organization would
recognize that if the organization was willing to defend clients without
IJ’s marquee value, then the principle must really be important.
CIR has taken a more narrowly legalistic approach to strategic litigation
than IJ, believing that the judges would be willing to accept uncomfortable
outcomes when faced with a powerful claim rooted in constitutional principle.
Emphasizing law, rather than the attractiveness of its client, draws on
CIR’s intellectual, academic organizational culture, as well as its darker,
more sardonic mood. The highly intellectual background of the CIR’s
staff—both Greve and Pell have PhD’s, and at least one of the organization’s
staff lawyers had hoped to go into teaching law before coming to
CIR—led them to become frustrated in organizations where they were pressured
to say things they knew were untrue and do things they thought were
a waste of time. While McDonald and Greve were repelled by conservative
public interest law, Pell found his way into conservative lawyering through
his negative experience with corporate law.

These firms defend big companies, and your job as an attorney is to think
through every possible ambiguity or possibility that might cost the company
money and get rid of it. Intellectually, it’s quite stifling. Anything you might
find interesting there’s a good chance the client wouldn’t find interesting. In fact
your job is to keep interesting things from happening to your client. You just
have to anticipate all the interest in these issues and wring it out. . . . So what
they paid us a lot of money to do was essentially to figure the next and the next
and the next logical step of these regulations so they could comply with those
interpretations of the regulations. I found it to be a waste of time. I thought
corporations were not particularly thoughtful about what they were doing; I’m
not sure it made economic sense. I didn’t find it reprehensible in a conventional
moral sense, I just didn’t want to be the one doing it. If they wanted someone
to do it, fine, just not me.

CIR’s organizational culture was attractive to lawyers like Pell, McDonald,
and Michael Rosman, CIR’s general counsel, because it allowed for
248 CHAPTER 7

a high standard of workmanship and professionalism, the kind of intellectually
satisfying lawyering they found so lacking in their previous experiences.
These men, in short, were looking for a way to be serious professionals,
as well as effective ideological activists. In CIR they found it.
The founders’ worldview was equally important in helping to structure
the organizational culture of CIR. Greve recalls that, in contrast to the
sunny optimism of IJ, “Mike [McDonald] and I always agreed that the
world was going to pot.” CIR’s founders did not believe that history was
on their side. McDonald and Greve believed that the hour was very late
indeed, that liberalism had already corrupted the fundamental forms of
law, politics, and society. The best that could be done was to use the law
to point out the hypocrisy of the Left and to win enough battles to make
liberals in government and universities hesitant in their use of power. CIR
believed that, if a case was structured carefully enough, judges would
conclude that they had to rule for their clients in order to preserve broader
rules, often those created by legal liberals. Rabkin recalls that CIR
thought that “we could do some good by showing that if courts were
going to be activist policymakers, we could remind everyone that liberal
constituencies wouldn’t be the only beneficiaries.”
This dark, sardonic mood of CIR comes out clearest in CIR’s newsletter,
the Docket Report, which summarizes the organization’s cases while
(especially before Greve left in 2000) simultaneously savaging its opponents
in a casual, wisecracking, intensely personal way.83 While the staff
of CIR clearly believed in the merits of their cases, the newsletter shows
that their mental energy was clearly directed at what they believed were
hypocritical and intellectually mediocre opponents. Especially venomous
was the opening essay in each issue, “The Last Line of Defense,” which
took its title from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, True Lies. For example,
in reference to Title IX, the Docket Report mocked the feminist position.
“For every female athletic slot that’s been created over the past five
years, five positions have been terminated. But that doesn’t matter because
we need equity and because without Title IX, women will again
have their feet bound and because then what would that do to the
WNBA.”84 Regarding the law firm of Harry Reasoner, the opposing counsel
in Hopwood, CIR noted that “the [National Journal] ratings [of law
firm minority participation] show, inter alia, the number of black partners
at Mr. Reasoner’s 539-lawyer firm, and wouldn’t you know, the answer
is one. Do let’s hope Mr. Reasoner takes him to the country club.”85 Assessing
the Violence Against Women Act, the Report cautioned that “in
all the excitement over the discovery that there are constitutional limits
to congressional power, it’s easily overlooked that VAWA is not—repeat,
not—a sensible law that, unfortunately, must give way to more important
constitutional constraints. VAWA is a piece of feminist demagoguery—a
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 249

‘conceptual breakthrough,’ NOW calls it—that thoroughly deserves a
short life and a brutal, violent death.”86 The common denominator in all
of these comments is an unwillingness to accept, as IJ has, the purported
goals of liberalism, which CIR consistently argued were a smokescreen
for power and attempts to circumvent constitutional rights.

Limitations on the Conservative Public Interest Law Network

Though both organizations have succeeded in reorienting conservative
public interest law, both CIR and IJ have faced important limits on their
effectiveness. The most significant constraint is the limited number of conservative
lawyers willing and able to provide their skills to pro bono work,
especially in areas less glamorous than IJ and CIR’s headline-grabbing
cases. Attracting attorneys to participate in the conservative legal cause
was a central part of the legal strategies mapped out by the second generation
of conservative public interest law. This was especially true for the
Center for Individual Rights, which sought to keep its staff and budget
small by depending on outside pro bono counsel drawn from veterans of
the Reagan administration and lawyers identified through the Federalist
Society’s recently developed lawyers chapters.
Inherent in the enterprise of public interest law—of any ideological coloration—is
the challenge of attracting ambitious lawyers with enormous
earning potential into poorly compensated, controversial, and time-consuming
public interest work. As chapter 2 showed, this was one of the
liberal legal networks’ most vexing problems, but it has turned out to be
even more difficult for conservatives than for their liberal predecessors.
First, liberals have been able to draw upon the powerful cultural resonance
between the pursuit of justice (defined in legal liberal terms) and a
career in law, while there are relatively few such normative resources for
conservative lawyers to draw upon.87 Second, the suspicion among legal
liberals that private, unregulated markets are a haven for injustice creates
a target for activism in the millions of everyday transactions of a capitalist
economy. Public interest lawyers doing even fairly mundane activities
(such as bringing suits against landlords or poring through environmental
impact statements) can easily imagine that they are part of a more sweeping
attempt to civilize capitalism. Libertarian conservatives by contrast,
want a less regulated society, and thus the environment for legal activism
writ small is more circumscribed. Third, as chapter 2 documented, much
of the infrastructure of modern public interest law, from law school clinics
to pro bono activism in private law firms and service as government lawyers,
has been organized by legal liberals and is encoded with the ideology
of their designers. It should not be a surprise that these channels are not
250 CHAPTER 7

particularly open, or at the least attractive, to conservatives and libertarians.
Fourth, and probably most important, conservatives rarely believe,
as many liberals do, that large, corporate law firms are inherently morally
polluting, and are consequently less willing to make the large financial
sacrifices inherent in public interest law.
Conservative firms face the same competitive pressures as public interest
law firms on the left. McDonald observes that

the pay scale for good attorneys has gone off the [charts]. I think, in this respect,

left or right, it’s mostly the same. You’re left with people whose heart is in the
right (or left) place, and they may be competent, but what you really need are
Supreme Court law clerk types who are really sharp. Otherwise you have attorneys
of the type who run walk-in legal clinics and process cases. They learn
their job, but it’s just a job. They don’t care. There are boutique constitutional
firms in D.C. that pay really large salaries to get the people we wanted. We had
a young woman who was excellent but since a firm like that offered her five
times as much to work for them she couldn’t “afford” the luxury of PI law.

CIR’s original organizational design was, in part, a response to this competitive
situation. “We couldn’t afford to hire a Scalia or a Rehnquist
clerk, but Jones Day or whomever could. Fine, let them hire the clerk,
and then let CIR ‘pitch’ a good constitutional law case to them, and let
them lobby their firm to take it.”88 While this model pushes much of the
costs of litigation off CIR’s books, it also puts extraordinary demands on
its handful of in-house lawyers, who must be exceptionally skilled and
creative, while also sufficiently malleable to fit the organization’s peculiar
structure. Given the still-limited resources of the larger conservative network,
the constraints of public interest work, the temperament of conservative
lawyers, and patrons’ lack of interest in nurturing future staff members,
CIR has faced a continuing problem of finding lawyers with the right
temperament and skills. Pell recalls that

we had this guy working for us for three years, the intake lawyer, a good guy,
really smart. Compared to private sector salaries we were paying him a pittance.
Well, it finally became clear when he left that he was independently wealthy.
. . . [By contrast] Rosman and I, who are the permanent types around here now,
just feel like we fell into this fantastic opportunity where we can do something
that we really want to do. Both of us have decided that it’s just worth paying
the price, without any security. I don’t know where you’d find people like us.

In addition to the problem of competing financially with private sector
firms, the controversial nature of the firm’s docket, the lack of job security,
and the still imperfectly institutionalized nature of the organization create
further challenges.
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 251

CIR is still a very ad hoc organization, and somebody who comes to work for
CIR feels like they’ve walked off a cliff. It’s partially the impermanence of the
organization—who knows, it could be out of existence in a couple of years. It’s
partially the race question; it does not make it easy to go from CIR to academia
or another law firm. IJ spends a lot of time cultivating all that institutional
mystique and ethos, boot camps and weekends, clinic; they have all that junk.
They’re cultivating human assets. We don’t spend ten seconds doing that and
everybody knows it. Someone who comes to work for us basically knows
they’re on their own.89

CIR was able to do without a significant investment in recruitment and
training for its first fifteen years because of the commitment of its founders
and the draw that its caseload had on smart, ideologically committed
young lawyers. Greve and McDonald have now moved on to other things,
and the legal environment is no longer the “target-rich” environment that
it once was. These changes may make CIR difficult to sustain as a major
player in conservative public interest law in the coming years.
The Institute for Justice has gone much further than CIR in attempting
to solve the supply problem, and it needs to, since its litigation strategy
depends upon in-house lawyers and following up its high-profile cases
with a large number of “copycat cases.” From its earliest days, IJ put a
substantial amount of time, energy, and money into training conservative
legal activists. An early grant solicitation, which placed support for educating
lawyers before IJ’s litigation program,90 noted that

while principled advocacy is essential, it is beyond the province of any one
organization or group of individuals to accomplish all that needs to be done.
Quite simply, there are not enough trained advocates who know how to make
use of the unique tools that our type of public interest law has to offer. Consequently,
a substantial effort must be made to train law students, lawyers, and
policy activists how to apply their talent and idealism in the real world of litigation,
media relations, and public debate. With such training, the talent pool of
effective advocates will be increased dramatically and the chances of ultimate
success will rise immeasurably. . . . Law schools teach students how to be technicians
manipulating an increasingly prescriptive system of laws and regulation,
too often without regard for principle or philosophy. Lawyers, driven by the
demands of private practice, rarely recognize opportunities to advance principles
within the context of their practices. . . . Our seminars would thus fill an
important niche and provide critically important training that would enhance
the long term effectiveness of all who attend.91

IJ, unlike CIR, was deeply concerned in its early years that there were not
enough skilled, experienced litigators to go around. While the Federalist
Society would help identify interested lawyers, it could do little to increase
252 CHAPTER 7

the numbers of conservatives willing to devote themselves to full-time
public interest litigation. IJ has tried to remedy the supply problem by
encouraging young lawyers and law students to filter through conservative
public interest law organizations, in the hopes that close contact with
public interest law would lessen the draw of private law practice. IJ runs
a three-day annual summer seminar at Georgetown University, and has
substantial and well-developed clerkship and internship programs, including
opportunities in its recently developed state chapters. According
to John Kramer, these programs have played an important role in persuading
young law students to consider a career in public interest law, and
have identified a large number of IJ’s hires over the last few years. “Historically,
that is a real proving ground for us. The students come in through
that, they’ve excelled before . . . and they’ve seen, from an inside perspective,
how we operate and have an appreciation for that style of communication
and litigation.”
CIR, on the other hand, has always had a less fleshed-out educational
and developmental program. Terry Pell attributes the difference between
the two organizations in this area to the pressures of fund-raising.

We have this summer clerk program, and it used to be this disorganized thing,
and whoever showed up showed up and that was that. Well, one of the first
things I did was to highlight this thing with a big article in the newsletter and
a special letter to all of our donors introducing it. I even had these kids write
letters. Then we sent out a questionnaire asking people to rank all the things
CIR does and one of them was training young lawyers through the summer
clerk program. Well, that was universally the lowest-ranked thing we did. Donors
didn’t care whether we did that at all. . . . Donors’ basic message was,
whatever you do, go win cases. Anything that’s a distraction from winning cases
we don’t care about. So if we had a clinic, they would just say, you guys should
be out winning cases, not running clinics. Somebody else should do that. IJ has
different donors.

The training and development of lawyers has, at best, a second-order
relationship to the issues that motivate CIR’s patrons, who in most cases
were attracted by the firm’s reputation for high-profile litigation and naturally
continue to be concerned with winning battles in the here and now.
Identifying and nurturing talent is a reasonable fit with IJ’s personal,
human-scale organizational culture, its broader ambitions, and the image
of itself that it projects to donors. CIR’s abstract, intellectual, legalistic
organizational culture and narrower focus on particular cases, by contrast,
attracts different kinds of donors with, at least in Pell’s view, different
time horizons and willingness to accept diffuse outcomes that will be
reaped by the conservative movement as a whole. While it would be very
difficult to verify the qualitative difference in IJ and CIR’s donor base, the
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 253

following figures show significance convergence in CIR and IJ’s foundation
patrons, but considerable divergence in their individual donor base.92

A. Percentage of IJ $10,000-and-up donors who give anything to CIR:
i. Foundations 16.7 percent
ii. Individuals 8.1 percent
B. Percentage of IJ $10,000-and-up donors who gave at least $10,000 to CIR:
i. Foundations 16.7 percent
ii. Individuals 3.5 percent
C. Total number of $10,000-and-up donors to CIR vs. IJ:
i. Foundations 8 vs. 37
ii. Individuals 11 vs. 86
D. Percentage of all $10,000-and-up donors to CIR who also gave to IJ:
i. Foundations 75 percent
ii. Individuals 30 percent

Given IJ’s substantially larger budget (three times larger than CIR),93 it is
not surprising that only a small percentage of its donors contribute to
CIR. What is more surprising is that, despite its smaller budget, only 30
percent of CIR’s larger donors gave to IJ. So it may be that the differences
in the two organizations’ ability to invest in human capital is, as Pell
argues, driven by what can be sold to their patrons.
The leaders of CIR and IJ both agree that recruiting conservative lawyers
into public interest law—either as a career or through pro bono
work—has been the second generation’s greatest organizational failure.
Chip Mellor notes, “It’s been one of our goals all along with our training
program for lawyers, and I’ll tell you, it hasn’t been as successful as I’d
like. It’s had some success, but, boy, I would have hoped for much more.
. . . I think every one we get is a plus, but I’m no longer thinking that
there is this unmobilized army out there waiting to charge the ramparts.”
Rosman believes that much of the supply problem can be attributed to
ideological bias. “It is very hard for conservative people in private practices
in large firms to do pro bono work as easily as it is for those with
liberal political views.” In his experience, large private law firms are more
likely to see public relations problems with conservative rather than liberal
pro bono activities, even if they don’t have a direct ideological bias
against such activity. As chapter 5 shows, the Federalist Society has invested
substantial resources in using publicity to change the behavior of
large firms’ pro bono committees and networking lawyers in private practice
with public interest work, but it is too early to determine whether it
will be successful.
The more fundamental source of the conservative legal movement’s
failure to match their liberal legal counterparts’ commitment to public
interest law work may be internal to the movement itself. Pell believes
254 CHAPTER 7

that the problem is traceable to the unwillingness of many conservative
lawyers to play a supporting role in legal change:

Conservatives have been trained with the idea that you can bring one blockbuster
case that changes legal precedent forever, and you can do it without
discovery by filing a few clever motions. . . . They are less likely to take cases
where it’s murky, complicated, involves lots of procedural hoops along the way
and where you’re playing the angles along the way through a lot of discovery.
That is not the kind of case that appeals to conservative lawyers. The other
kind of case that doesn’t appeal to them is the run-of-the-mill “So-and-so didn’t
get tenure and it’s a race preference. It’s like every other one of these cases but
it would be a good idea if someone took it, wouldn’t you like to take it.” The
answer is invariably, “No, I would not.” Let me litigate the Michigan case but
I don’t want to bother with some small employment discrimination case.
There’s no conservative who thinks they belong in the minor leagues, as a general
matter. With liberals, if you go to any law firm pro bono committee, they
just have dozens of moronic little cases where they’re representing some tenant
in a landlord-tenant dispute and it’s the individual rather than the larger legal
principle that attracts lawyers to those cases. . . . So somebody gets a sense
that they are helping the cause when they bring one of these little cases. The
conservative mission is not built around a lot of little cases, so people feel sidelined
when you give them one.

Any legal movement needs to have an informal division of labor, with a
substantial pool of lawyers willing to engage in fairly routine but often
labor-intensive trial work that applies existing precedents. The conservative
public interest law field, by contrast, is top-heavy, with a reasonable
number of lawyers willing to volunteer for “A Team” work but few willing
to participate at the lower ranks. This vice may be inseparable from
the virtues of the more libertarian (as opposed to religious) side of conservatism:
a belief system that does not celebrate an ethos of service, humility,
or collective endeavor is likely to be hampered when movement activities
call for just those attributes. Christian conservatives, by contrast, have
been able to draw upon religious supports for these qualities, and seem
to have been more successful in drawing a wide base of lawyers to bring
non-precedent-setting cases.94
The lack of a “B Team” to support the CIR and IJ “A Team” has also
meant that conservatives have been less able to avail themselves of the
spontaneous, unplanned action that their Hayekian principles point to.
The dearth of conservative and libertarian lawyers willing to engage in
pro bono activity means that most conservative legal activism flows
through firms like CIR and IJ, rather than bubbling up from below. As
Mellor observes, “The biggest lack right now is dedicated pro bono work
by a cadre of conservative and libertarian lawyers around the country.
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 255

I’m not even talking about finding them, because we don’t use them. I’m
talking about people who go out there and do it on their own voluntarily,
and I just don’t see it happening.” This lack of unplanned, entrepreneurial
litigation reduces the opportunity for unorthodox legal strategies or trial
and error, and so conservatives are betting a great deal on the effectiveness
of legal strategies developed at the top of the legal food chain.
Two of IJ’s more recent projects, its entrepreneurship clinic at the University
of Chicago and its state chapters, may have some effect on increasing
supply in the long term. Started in 1997, IJ’s Clinic on Entrepreneurship
can be directly linked to its annual training program. University of
Chicago law professor Richard Epstein recalls,

We had two students, Mark Chenoweth, who is now at the Koch Foundation,

and Tim Koh, who keeps bouncing around from one Senate committee to another
and I think is now clerking for Justice Thomas. [They] went to an IJ
conference where they talked about freedom of contract [and] limited government.
. . . They came into my office and said, “You know Chip Mellor?” I said,
“Yeah, I’ve been involved with Chip from the beginning.” . . . They said, “We’d
like to start a clinic here that would do some transactional work,” and their
attitude was that too many people who think about civil rights think about
beating people over the head to hire them, and their attitude is rather than beat
other people over the head, we want to beat the government over the head. . . .
It will be a transactional clinic which will help people get through the regulatory
maze. So they came to me and I was strongly in favor of it. The clinic people
were originally very dubious about this. . . . IJ was known to be ideological,
and what they didn’t know is that . . . they have most stellar reputation of
anyone I’ve every dealt with. . . . They have a terribly conciliatory style of doing
business. There were hearings and objections. . . . He [Mellor] came here, and
he never rose to the bait, which is more than you can say for me. The dean was
Douglas Baird, and he was uneasy about doing this himself, so he set up a
committee. In the end the committee realized it would be a great deal. In the
first year there was some suspicion, but in the six or seven years it has been in
place there has not been a peep of dissent or controversy on the part of anybody.

Given IJ’s ideological reputation, opposition was almost inevitable. In the
end, IJ’s reputation for competence, its ability to fund the program itself,
and the opportunity provided by the existing structure of clinical education
at the Law School helped sweep away opposition. Epstein recalls that
the clinic was

in a sense . . . ideological, but in a way that appealed to both left and right. All

of these clinics have an ideology. The mental health clinic trying to protect people
who were thrown out in the street by the city, they would be appalled if
they thought they were some sort of neutral [project]. . . . The program was
256 CHAPTER 7

fully funded from the outside, which was a huge advantage when we needed to
expand our capabilities. It was a transactional program when we had none
before.... There was a long debate on whether they would have to take cases
from needy clients that didn’t fit their mission statement, like supporting quotas
or affirmative action. After a while, people realized, hey, we don’t tell any of
our clinics what cases to take or how to run them. The questions were such
things as who gets to control the appointments, and we decided that they [IJ]
get to propose the appointments and we have to ratify.

The Law School was already supporting clinics with controversial cases,
such as the MacArthur Justice Center, which specializes in challenges to
the death penalty, prison conditions, and conditions at Guanta´namo Bay.
Consequently, it was difficult to challenge IJ’s program on the basis of its
ideology without raising problems for the existing programs. So far, the
clinic has not produced any significant legal cases, and few if any of its
alumni have gone into public interest law, which is not surprising given
that most of its participants are specialists in business law, and its caseload
is focused on transactions, not litigation. IJ hopes to replicate its clinic at
other law schools when the right opportunity presents itself.95
IJ’s other effort to extend its reach and attract new lawyers into libertarian
public interest law work are its state chapters in Arizona, Minnesota,
and Washington. Clint Bolick recalls the original impetus for the chapters:

We began noticing several years ago that in some areas, especially school choice
and eminent domain, we were litigating mostly state constitutional issues. The
Left discovered the utility of state constitutions decades ago. For all our talk
about federalism, most conservative litigating groups have focused on federal
constitutional issues. We began a two-year study of the potential for state chapters
focusing on state constitutional issues. We also studied liberal groups, especially
the ACLU, to examine their models.

So far, IJ’s experience in state-level public interest law has been mixed. In
Arizona, IJ had a number of advantages, not the least of which was
Bolick’s willingness to move to Phoenix when the chapter was created in
2001. In addition,

We chose Arizona because we had good contacts there, we had litigated there
with success, it has an honest judiciary, there is a strong free-market policy
organization (Goldwater Institute), and it has a libertarian tradition. Subsequently
we opened chapters in North Carolina and Washington. North Carolina
did not work out because we could not find the right director—we now
recognize that human capital is the first prerequisite to success—and could not
find sufficient core-mission cases. It is in transition to a North Carolina—based
public interest law firm. Arizona and Washington are going great. We just won
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 257

a wonderful eminent domain precedent in Arizona that will aid our efforts in
other states. We are currently investigating potential in other states.96

Setting up state chapters is a natural outgrowth of IJ’s emphasis on “grassroots
tyranny.” Eminent domain, for example, has certain similarities to
such popular liberal areas of litigation as housing and criminal law, in
that there are thousands of opportunities to challenge administrative decisions,
which allows individual lawyers to feel a part of something much
more significant than their individual case. These cases, combined with
IJ’s increasing state-level organizational presence and additional libertarian-oriented
clinics, may help to overcome the movement’s continuing
absence of a B Team. The effects of all of these activities are still unclear,
and will be for some time to come.

Organizational Adaptation and Evolution

As we saw in the discussion of “boundary maintenance” in chapter 5,
successful organizational entrepreneurs must avoid absorbing new functions
that distract from or contradict their original mission while, at
the same time, developing new areas of opportunity consistent with the
organization’s core functions. Failing at the first of these can lead to
resource constraints, a loss of organizational focus, and a confused public
image. Failing at the second can lead to a loss of organizational dynamism
as rival organizations exploit new opportunities and staff become
bored and move on to other opportunities. IJ began life with a clear
and consistent legal strategy and issue focus, so the greatest threat to its
organizational flourishing has been losing focus and being drawn into
areas in tension with its original mission. Given that CIR was designed
to be flexible and opportunistic, its greatest challenge has been to avoid
being trapped in cases that limit its ability to discover and take advantage
of unexploited prospects for legal change. While CIR maintained
extraordinary dynamism in its early years, the demands of its affirmative
action litigation have made it less effective than IJ in overcoming its
fundamental challenge.
The issue of affirmative action has presented the most serious challenge
to IJ’s organizational focus. While IJ as an organization has never litigated
the issues of affirmative action or race-based congressional districting, the
topic was a priority for Clint Bolick, whose interest in it dated back to
his service on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Bolick’s
involvement with these issues reached its hottest point when President
Clinton nominated Lani Guinier to be assistant attorney general for civil
rights. Bolick famously penned an op-ed accusing both Guinier and Edu-
258 CHAPTER 7

cation Department nominee Norma Cantu of being “Clinton’s Quota
Queens,”97 helping set off a controversial confirmation battle that ended
with the withdrawal of Guinier’s nomination. Bolick went on less than
two years later to attack Deval Patrick, and then four years later Bill Lann
Lee, for the same position as Guinier, and for the same reason.98 Bolick
capped off this involvement by publishing The Affirmative Action Fraud
in 1996.99
This activity brought Bolick and IJ enormous public attention and a
high profile in the conservative movement. Mellor recalls that “Clint was
very good at being a media personality on [affirmative action]. He was
the go-to guy whenever there was a contentious issue, and then he takes
on Lani Guinier. To everyone’s surprise, we win. And so he became a
prominent national spokesperson on that issue, and with that came opportunities
for more—litigation, money, publicity.” Despite the enormous
attention it attracted, affirmative action was an issue where opportunistically
responding to attention ran counter to IJ’s core mission. Mellor explains
that

there just came a point on it, after a couple of years, where it became clear that
this was a distraction. We were really getting out into an issue that was not
central to our mission, and furthermore it was [creating] conflict in the very
[same] communities that were most directly active in our litigation and encumbering
the organization and the other individuals in the organization with issues
that were counterproductive. . . . So we said, let’s not do that anymore. . . .
Despite the fact that a lot of points were wonderfully well made and completely
valid it just didn’t complement our issues, and we had just gotten into it because
of Clint’s personal interest and the surprise success of the Lani Guinier issue
and allowed that to be a target of opportunity that just pulled us further and
further down this one path. . . . One of the keys to our success has been staying
focused—seizing occasional targets of opportunity but staying focused and not
getting distracted, and when we were distracted, getting rapidly out.

Affirmative action has always been a difficult issue for IJ. Despite Mellor
and especially Bolick’s intense disagreement with the policy, the issue runs
counter to IJ’s organizational culture, which is optimistic and oriented to
pushing conservative “empowerment” approaches to the problems of the
poor and racial minorities. Criticizing liberal policies like affirmative action
was, by contrast, “more of a CIR thing.”100
All of CIR’s successes, by contrast, have come from being nimble and
opportunistic, but the organization’s responses to those opportunities
have created commitments that now make it difficult to reorient it
around new areas of litigation. This threatens to produce the kind of
institutionalization its founders feared. Terry Pell recalls that “the Greve
model was to blow up the institution, essentially. He never wanted the
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 259

institution to get to the point where it couldn’t be easily blown up.”
Greve’s study of the environmental movements of the United States and
Germany101 had sensitized him to the risk that organizational maintenance
imperatives could encourage public interest movements to stay
committed to a particular line of cases or issues once the opportunity
for a major impact had passed. This commitment to organizational nimbleness
also reflected a strategic assessment of conservatives’ position in
modern American institutions.

They [liberals] are much more concerned about permanently owning territory,
so however the law changes, they just adapt them to the territory that they’ve
already acquired. The Right does not own much institutional territory at all, so
the only tool we’ve got is some big ideological or legal precedent that you can
quickly get without having to run a lot of institutions. Whereas the Left owns
every big university in the country because they control the personnel, the way
we influence those institutions is to get their race preference policy struck down
by the Supreme Court. Because we don’t control those institutions, we have to
do this from the outside.102

CIR believed that the most conservatives could achieve through the courts
were formal legal victories that established a legal principle, rather than
wholesale reform.
Staying nimble and remaining open to new areas of opportunity was,
in part, a recognition of the limited potential of the law to transform
institutions controlled by liberals. Avoiding excessive commitment to a
particular issue was also connected to CIR’s preference for a lean organizational
form. Staying small required that CIR pursue reasonably clear
precedents that would avoid the need for substantial, resource-intensive,
follow-on litigation. This contrasted with what they viewed as the legal
strategy of the Left, which was to obtain relatively diffuse, “balancing”-
type rulings that could be used as a resource in subsequent waves of litigation
and bureaucratic politics. Both CIR’s size and the temperament and
normative commitments of its staff made long-term commitment to an
issue unappealing.

Wanting to have clear laws drives the size of our organization and our desire
to be nimble. People here do not find it interesting to file the same case over
and over again . . . or to organize legions of lawyers to bring the same case over
and over again. . . . Lawyers on the right, they always want to be involved in
the biggest, baddest, most precedent-setting case around. They don’t want to
bring the follow-on cases. On the other hand, the Left has organized itself to
bring hundred and thousands of follow-on cases. So if they get some little slight
advantage in a legal precedent anywhere, they’re organized to take advantage
of it in all kinds of different contexts. That’s one institutional advantage they
have over us. We’re just organized to do a different thing.103
260 CHAPTER 7

The emphasis on “wholesale litigation” can be seen in the diminishing
role of religious liberty and academic free speech in CIR’s caseload. This
was partially driven by the demands of CIR’s affirmative action cases,
which required a long-term commitment and attention to fund-raising
that severely tested CIR’s organizational design. The decline of the issue
was also a matter of conscious design. As McDonald argues, “We did
want to be first to make a big point and clear the way for other groups
to do things wholesale.” With its precedent in Rosenberger, for example,
CIR created a powerful precedent that a wide range of other organizations,
especially Christian conservatives like the American Center for Law
and Justice, could use in their own litigation. By demonstrating that restrictions
on campus free speech were vulnerable and would rarely be
defended by the courts, CIR made it easy for groups like the Foundation
for Individual Rights in Education and the Individual Rights Foundation
to create an industry out of suing universities for violating the free speech
rights of professors and students.
Paradoxically, CIR committed itself to both nimbleness and a willingness
to stick with cases for as long as necessary. In its previous litigation,
this latter commitment had not created any serious problems for CIR as
the cases were not fact-intensive and were susceptible to relatively quick
resolution. Terry Pell notes that the affirmative action cases, beginning
with Hopwood, exposed this previously unimportant tension in CIR’s
strategy.

The problem we ran into was the race preference cases. . . . If we say we’re
trying to change the law and set new precedent, we can’t walk away from this.
One of the things we tell our donors is that we pick the tough fights and stay
in them for the long haul. . . . We’re not dissuaded by this, that, or the other
adverse opinion along the way. Well, that means that you can’t just walk away
from this stuff or your donors wonder what you’re doing. In this case one of
the big challenges we’ve had is that the race preference cases have swallowed
up the ability of CIR to be flexible and take risks and move onto new areas.
Our time is spent just keeping that thing alive and moving.

The difficulty that the affirmative action cases have presented is threefold.
First, they absorbed an enormous amount of time and effort, which limited
CIR’s ability to develop new cases and areas of expertise. Second, the
cases necessarily put a damper on CIR’s freewheeling intellectual organizational
culture. With a commitment as large and challenging as affirmative
action, the scrutiny on CIR’s utterances increased exponentially, and
as a consequence there was pressure for staff to stay “on message.” This
meant, for example, avoiding saying in public what at least one staff member
believed, which is that all of the civil rights laws reaching private
conduct were unconstitutional. This created enormous stresses for an or-
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 261

ganization that prided itself on fearless truth-telling and an unwillingness
to bend to political correctness. It also took some of the fun out of what,
for its first few years, had been an incredibly exciting environment to
operate in.
Finally, the fund-raising required by the affirmative action cases also
had a profound effect on CIR’s previously dynamic organizational structure.
Affirmative action certainly fit CIR’s strategy of attacking the discretion
of liberal institutions and had the benefit of attracting a large
number of new donors, many of whom were frustrated by the Republican
Party’s hesitancy in attacking the issue. After receiving a surprise
gift of $1.5 million from a previously low-dollar donor, CIR hired a
number of staff attorneys, moving the organization away from its original,
lean structure, toward something that looked more like IJ. Michael
McDonald recalls that

the official rationale for hiring more attorneys was: we now know this stuff,
affirmative action. So we don’t need to continually look for cooperating counsel.
We have the money to do the cases in-house, but we didn’t really want to
do run-of-the-mill AA cases. So we had one foot in the old model and one foot
in the newer model. I saw it wasn’t working and advocated returning to the
older model, but we had the ACLU-envy problem. Certain people close to us or
on our board would say, “Why can’t you be like the ACLU and have a chapter in
every state or do more wholesale litigation.” I suppose that was one of the many
things we never fully sorted out.

This influx of new money into the organization thus created two problems.
First, it loosened the external constraints that made CIR’s original
organizational structure a necessity. Second, the presence of a substantial
pool of new donors attracted by affirmative action and unfamiliar with
CIR’s organizational culture has made it difficult to reorient the firm
around new issues. This has fed back into problems in attracting significant
legal talent to the firm, since CIR can only compensate for its relatively
low salaries and the stigma that attaches to its affirmative action
cases by maintaining a reputation for intellectual excitement and challenge.
It has become clear to CIR’s leaders that what is necessary in order
to attract entrepreneurial people—a constant stream of new cases—may
run counter to what is necessary to hold onto a mature funding base.

Donors are like students. They sign up for your class because they have an idea
of what they’re going to get, and you have to have an idea of what they think
they’re getting, so you can make them feel like they got that. We have a subset
of our donors who are only interested in affirmative action, but I think that is
only a subset. The larger group of donors is interested in affirmative action or
other things like affirmative action. . . . So when you pick a new area you have
262 CHAPTER 7

to take your donors as they are and kind of move them and explain to them
why, given what they’ve already found interesting, they might also find this
other thing interesting. So it’s a game. . . . There is [also] an institutional fatigue
factor. The people who started these things were very entrepreneurial; Mike
Greve and Mike McDonald are examples of that. Well, you just get tired after
a while. This institution has been around for ten years and it’s just harder to get
people excited about doing a new thing. So that pushes people in the direction of
doing something that’s predictable.104

Despite all the attention that Hopwood, Gratz, and Grutter brought to
CIR, the issue also created a powerful, self-reinforcing dynamic rooted in
its new donor base that has eaten away at the organization’s opportunistic
ethos. The choice to attack affirmative action was fateful, as once CIR
took on affirmative action, its reputation within the conservative movement
rested upon its ability to push these cases to a conclusion, no matter
how long it took or the impact the cases had on its organizational culture.
IJ has effectively managed the challenges to its organizational focus,
but CIR has found it difficult to move on from the affirmative action
cases that have absorbed so much of its time and attention. IJ effectively
extricated itself from the issue of affirmative action, thereby regaining its
concentration on its core issues and eliminating a substantial obstacle to
“strange bedfellows” coalitions with local minority groups. CIR has, in
the last few years, begun to open up new litigation areas, such as its challenge
to the authority of Child Protective Services agencies to order medical
procedures opposed by parents or legal guardians.105 While this issue
may be genuinely important, it lacks the gut-level appeal to the conservative
movement or the potential for establishing wide-ranging precedent
of CIR’s earlier cases. CIR, having thrived on opportunism in the past,
may find it hard to regain the energy it once had as its involvement with
affirmative action continues and the number of attractive targets for its
style of litigation diminishes.

Conclusion

As the example of the first generation of conservative public interest law
showed, opportunities, threats, and the availability of resources do not
necessarily translate into effective social movement organizations. As a
consequence, it is possible for social movements to miss opportunities
when their organizations are not up to the task of exploiting changes in
the political environment. The development of effective political organizations
is a highly contingent process that unfolds over time, and to
understand it requires probing deeply into social movements’ internal
C O N S E R V A T I V E P U B L I C I N T E R E S T L A W II 263

reevaluation of past investments and innovations in political strategy
and tactics. It is this internal rhythm of puzzling and problem solving,
rather than changes in the political environment, that seems most important
in explaining the emergence of conservative public interest law’s
second generation.
The second-generation conservative firms were the product of intramovement
learning: when combined with their continued interest in promoting
legal change, patrons’ post—Horowitz Report recognition that
previous approaches to conservative public interest law had been failures
provided an opening for new organizational entrepreneurs to approach
patrons for support. Because first-generation firms faced strong incentives
to maintain their approach, this learning process occurred through generational
replacement rather than organizational evolution. It took ten
years of missed litigation opportunities before this process of learning and
generational replacement produced CIR and IJ. This points to a factor
largely missing from studies of legal “backlash”:106 organizational entrepreneurs,
and the patrons who support them, are the essential link between
political opportunities and political outcomes. Explaining when
and how backlash occurs thus requires that we recognize the considerable
intellectual, organizational, and resource mobilization obstacles that
countermobilizing agents face.
Overcoming the obstacles to effective countermobilization in public
interest law depended upon the maturing of the broader conservative
legal movement. Movement patrons had to wait for a new generation
of leaders to emerge and for them to develop sufficient experience and
strategic sophistication to be a reasonable outlet for sizable, long-term
investment. In addition, second-generation strategies depended upon the
growth of a broad network of conservative lawyers and the ripening
of the movement’s ideas. The Federalist Society was the conservative
movement’s core investment in the development of both of these resources,
and so it is not an accident that the second-generation firms
emerged after the Society had become a major, institutionalized presence
in American legal culture.
The success of IJ and CIR also depended upon a shift in the character
of conservative patrons, from business leaders to foundation directors.
Leaders of the conservative legal movement had been repeatedly frustrated
by the lack of imagination and principle of American businessmen
and their willingness to cooperate with government despite their rhetorical
attachment to antistatism. The emergence of forthrightly libertarian
firms like IJ and CIR, therefore, had to await the decline of business’s
leadership of the conservative movement and its replacement with an alliance
between intellectuals and charitable foundations. The leaders of
these foundations shared with those they funded a primary locus of social-
264 CHAPTER 7

ization and network in the world of ideas rather than the world of enterprise.
Thus the public interest law firms capable of defending the free
market depended strongly on the emergence of a “new class” of conservative
activists motivated by ideological and cultural goals rather than economic
interests. This new class of conservative activists—both patrons
and organizational entrepreneurs—have found their inspiration in the empowerment
of the inner-city poor, affirmative action, and academic freedom,
rather than the interests of business.
The shift of conservative public interest law’s “principals” from business
to the new class of conservative patrons and entrepreneurs accompanied
a transformation in the movement’s ideological orientation. Whereas
most of the first-generation firms were traditionally conservative in orientation,
Capital Legal Foundation, CIR, and IJ all flew the flag of libertarianism,
and the most successful litigation by first-generation firms (such
as Pacific Legal Foundation’s work in Nollan) had a libertarian spirit as
well. These firms were able to take advantage of a structural bias in the
American legal system orienting public interest law to challenging governmental
discretion and power rather than (as many traditional conservatives
preferred) defending it. When legal conservatives have sought to
limit the power of government, either through the use of the commerce
clause, the First Amendment, or the takings clause, their success has been
impressive. However, when they have attempted to use public interest law
to support the authority of government, they have found little success.107
This bias in the American legal system led CIR, for example, to converge
with the libertarianism of IJ, and has given the firm some unexpected
affinities with its liberal counterparts. Terry Pell observes that

the norms [of most large institutions] are driven by the general principle of
efficiency. That’s what these managerial institutions are supposed to do, achieve
a certain objective in the most efficient way possible without questioning
whether that objective is a legitimate objective to pursue at all. . . . We, all of
us, on the left and the right, are the ones saying, “No, we ought to be having a
debate about whether efficiency in this area is such a good idea, and whether
the ends being served here are appropriate in a free society.”

The enterprise of public interest law gives firms like IJ and CIR other
interests in common with their liberal counterparts, especially where the
political economy of public interest lawyering is concerned. For instance,
any measure that would reduce the financial lure of high-paying
corporate law work, or that increased the prestige of public interest law,
would solve both liberal and conservative firms’ problems in attracting
high-quality legal talent. Firms like IJ and CIR are certainly a part of
the larger conservative-libertarian movement, but they are also public
interest lawyers, and this gives them a different view of the world than
their ideological allies.
Conclusion

THESE FINAL PAGES move beyond the case of the law, identifying directions
for future research on large-scale political change and the lessons
of the conservative experience for political entrepreneurs and patrons.
Drawing on the cases in the preceding chapters, I present an approach to
understanding the rhythms and mechanisms of large-scale political
change, one that puts agency, contingency, and policy and institutional
variability at its core. Second, I identify what the example of the law can
teach us about the transformation of the conservative movement over the
past forty years. In doing so, I place special emphasis on conservatism’s
shift from a movement dominated by business, grassroots organizations,
and Republican elected officials to one increasingly directed by a conservative
“new class” of ideologically motivated actors. Third, I conclude by
asking what lessons the experience of conservatives in the law over the
past forty years hold for political entrepreneurs and patrons, both in the
law and beyond.

The Rhythms and Sources of Political Change

Social scientists have a long-standing fascination with modeling politics
as a market with a natural tendency toward equilibrium. In the famous
“Hotelling” model of political competition, losing political parties were
modeled as adjusting their bids to the electorate by moving closer to the
median voter.1 The force of political competition, this model claimed,
ruled out long-term political or policy advantage. American political history,
however, has been marked by long periods in which one ideological
“team” outcompetes the other, producing institutional and policy change
in its preferred direction for decades. If politics is truly competitive, the
losing side in political competition should rapidly compete away any advantages
possessed by the winners.
The Hotelling model assumes that political markets are like markets
for commodities, in that the demand is fixed, products are homogenous,
technology of production is simple and transparent, start-up costs are
low, and barriers to entry are nonexistent. These are very poor assumptions
for modern politics, in which the agenda is up for grabs (demand is
variable and products are differentiated), the technology of production is
complex and nontransparent (expertise and political strategy are im-
266 CONCLUSION

portant), start-up costs are high (complex organizations are required that
demand substantial trial and error to produce), and barriers to entry are
significant (those created by policies and institutional design, and through
the transfer of politically significant activity into civil society). The complexity
of political competition means that actors do not limit themselves
to the marginal advantages of median voter models, but seek to construct
a “regime” that will generate supernormal profits over a span of decades.
In that sense, politics is more like markets for technology than markets
for potatoes.2
The foregoing chapters identified four sources of durable competitive
advantage in politics: ideas and arguments, political strategies and institutional
design, the reputations of political movements, and entrenchment
in civil society. Of these, ideas are especially important. Political movements
can attain a durable advantage by identifying their own ideas with
common sense, intellectual seriousness, responsibility, professionalism,
and ordinary decency, while claiming that their opponents’ ideas are “off
the wall”—eccentric, irresponsible, morally dubious, and outside the professional
mainstream. A movement whose ideas have been effectively
branded as off the wall will find it impossible to attract supporters who
are, like most professionals, acutely concerned with being seen as responsible,
serious, and mainstream.
Ideational entrenchment was an especially acute challenge for conservatives,
and overcoming it was the object of some of the movement’s
longest-term projects. In its early years the organizational entrepreneurs
of the law and economics movement devoted enormous effort to overcoming
the widespread belief that the approach was nothing more than
thinly veiled ideology, properly dismissed rather than argued with. The
Federalist Society was founded by conservative students in elite law
schools to force the legal establishment to seriously consider ideas that
were typically dismissed as strange or reactionary. Public interest law
firms faced the challenge of ideational entrenchment as well, and were
forced to devote significant resources to convincing courts that resurrecting
the commerce and takings clauses of the Constitution was something
more than a far-out attempt to take the nation back to the era of Lochnerism.
It was only after they broke through the powerful ideological insulation
of legal liberalism that conservatives were able to compete on a reasonably
even playing field.
Political strategies and institutional design are a second source of durable
competitive advantage in politics. For example, chapter 2 described
how liberals developed a network of public interest groups, tied to congressional
subcommittees, the regulatory bureaucracy, and the legal profession
that were able to maximize the potential of regulatory statutes
despite the significant costs this imposed on business and local govern-
CONCLUSION 267

ments. While conservatives tried to overcome this organizational-institutional
alignment through efforts to “defund the Left” and by creating a
network of conservative firms to provide the “other side,” chapter 3
showed that, well into the 1980s, neither strategy was effective in eroding
this source of legal liberals’ competitive advantage. It took more than two
decades before conservatives were able to effectively use legislation to
erode many of the accomplishments of public interest law, and a decade
and a half before they had public interest law firms of their own vying for
the agenda of the federal courts.3
A third source of competitive political advantage can be found in the
reputations of political movements. A common device that ordinary citizens
and potential recruits use to decide whether to support movements is
reliance on the moral reputation of advocates on particular issues. These
reputations are sticky because people readily attend to information that
reinforces their preexisting evaluations, and so once a movement has developed
a reputation, it can be hard to shake. By the 1960s, legal liberalism
had come to be associated, especially among the young, with idealism,
the individual, civil rights, and a concern with justice, while conservatism
was tarred with the brush of self-interest, unseemly ties to business and
other large concentrations of power, and a lack of concern for racial justice.
These reputations were so powerful that for almost twenty years
conservative public interest law was treated as an oxymoron, and with it
the belief that the highest ideals of the legal profession could be reconciled
with ideological conservatism. The programming of the conservative
movement over the last twenty-five years was, to a considerable degree,
aimed at transforming this reputation. The Federalist Society organized
its conferences and campus speakers to convince young lawyers that conservatism
was the movement of serious intellectual thought and legal liberals
the defenders of a stale status quo. Following the argument that
Michael Horowitz made in 1980, the Institute for Justice’s caseload was
designed to use high-profile litigation to make liberals look like the defenders
of irresponsible, self-interested, concentrated power, while conservatives
were the protectors of the public interest, the little guy, and the
cause of racial equality. These nonlegal goals meant that IJ could win, in
the sense of helping to alter the reputation of conservatism, even when it
lost in court.
The final source of durable competitive advantage is political entrenchment
in civil society, in our case the legal profession and the nation’s
law schools. Law schools are especially important to the construction of
durable advantage because they are one of the main arbiters of distinction
in the legal profession. Competition over control of law schools was,
therefore, a battle for who would determine standards of professional
honor and prestige and control the boundaries on the kinds of ideas that
268 CONCLUSION

are held by respectable lawyers. By the early 1970s, the ideological assumptions
of law professors, their construction of the profession of legal
education, and the movements and interest groups that were institutionally
connected to law schools had developed a significant bias toward
legal liberalism. Given the self-reproducing character of the professoriate,
the perception (if not the reality) that legal education was hostile to conservatives,
and the greater attractions of private practice for those on the
right, conservatives faced a strategic problem without an obvious solution.
While law and economics was a reasonably rapid response to liberal
dominance in legal education, in other areas (especially constitutional
law), change has been slow. One response, the Olin Fellows program administered
by the Federalist Society, appears to have had some success in
encouraging the hiring of non–law and economics faculty in elite law
schools, but this is still work at the margins.
In all four of these areas, conservatives invested significant time and
engaged in widespread experimentation before they figured out how to
erode the competitive advantage of legal liberalism. The lag between the
emergence of liberals’ initial advantage and the development of an effective
conservative response was a matter of decades. What can explain this
persistence of durable advantage? How can we make sense of when these
advantages erode or disappear? To develop an answer, we must begin by
reframing the concept of “regime.” As I use it, a regime can be said to
exist when there are multiple, reinforcing sources of durable advantage
present in any particular policy or institutional domain (or, more broadly,
when such advantages exist across an entire polity). So, for example, we
can say that there was a “liberal legal regime” because of the interacting
sources of durable advantage in the realm of ideas, institutions and political
strategy, movement reputations, and civil society. The deeper the durable
advantage, the more we can say that a particular regime is “entrenched.”
Put in economic terms, an entrenched regime can be said to
allow its supporters to extract monopoly rents or “supernormal” profits.
Thinking of regimes in terms of competition helps us to endogenize the
process of political change, because few if any of the sources of durable
change are so entrenched as to be immune from challenge. Rather than
being noncompetitive, it is better to think about entrenched regimes as
being “contestable markets.”4 If regimes really were pure monopolies,
then the losers in politics would have no option but to sit back and wait
for some exogenous shock to bring them salvation.5 Like incumbents in
contestable markets, however, political regimes almost always have vulnerabilities.
Resistance is almost never futile. In most cases, the regime’s
advantage comes because it has created a “technology” that the other side
finds hard to replicate. This is one way to think about the explosion of
public interest law in the late 1960s and early 1970s: liberals had created
CONCLUSION 269

a tool that took conservatives a very long time to make sense of and master,
and it was embedded in a social network that conservatives could not
match. There was nothing in the liberal advantage in the area that could
not be competed away, but it required intellectual, strategic, and organizational
creativity that emerged only with a very significant lag.
When these durable competitive advantages are eroded depends upon
the character of entrenchment and the quality of agent response. To understand
entrenchment and how agents maneuver around it, let us start
with two examples from technology. Microsoft was able to derive supernormal
profits for a sustained period of time because of barriers to entry
created by its intellectual property and the network effects that attracted
users and software producers to its dominant standard in operating systems.
Dell Computer quickly developed a commanding position in the
market for personal computers by combining a just-in-time production
process with direct sales to consumers. In the first instance, Microsoft’s
powerful position on the desktop made it almost impossible to mount a
“symmetrical” challenge in the form of an alternative operating system.
Instead, Microsoft’s competitive position has been threatened by an
“asymmetric” challenge from competitors such as Google seeking to
move software off the desktop entirely, through web-based applications.
In Dell’s case, there was never any mystery as to what it was doing, but
competitors had substantial investments in preexisting ways of organizing
production and sales or failed to reengineer their organizations to execute
with Dell’s efficiency. Eventually competitors eroded this competitive advantage
by a symmetric strategy of mimicry: they simply got better, over
time, in doing the things that Dell had done for years. For a decade, however,
Dell was able to sustain very high profits and sales, despite its completely
transparent strategy. In the first case, change happened when competitors
hit upon a rival strategy that exposed a previously unseen or
unexploited angle of attack. In the second case, change happened when
rivals developed organizational forms that rivaled those of their competitors.
In both cases, change came from the skill of rival agents at discovering
weaknesses in the dominant actor and developing strategies or
organizational forms capable of exploiting it.
The metaphor of technological change can help us understand the endogenous
sources of large-scale policy and institutional change, and the
cases of IJ and the Center for Individual Rights are a useful place to start.
The first source of endogenous change is learning. Previous generations
of conservative public interest lawyers simply did not understand the
sources of liberal public interest lawyers’ success and missed out on significant
opportunities to learn from them. It took a new generation of
firms, with lawyers who had studied their liberal predecessors closely, to
draw appropriate lessons. The second source of endogenous change is
270 CONCLUSION

organizational structure. The first generation of public interest lawyers
was organized along geographic lines in an increasingly centralized polity
that rewarded D.C.-based networks and the opportunistic selection of
venue. This organizational form was exceptionally sticky, but when conservatives
developed new, D.C.-based firms with weak or nonexistent ties
to business, they were able to rapidly produce significant victories in the
courts and in public opinion. A final source of endogenous change can be
found in relationships with patrons. The first generation of public interest
lawyers failed to recognize the strategic importance of idealism, and as a
consequence their close ties to business hurt their reputation for “public
interestedness” and their ability to attract high-quality lawyers. Largescale
change happened when competitors to legal liberalism developed
ties to new patrons, leading to a shift in their reputation and ability to
attract young lawyers comparable to those of their competitors.
In none of these cases were opportunities for effective political competition
unavailable in the decades before they were effectively exploited.
That is, the regime of public interest law had always been vulnerable.
Thinking of entrenchment in terms of unexploited vulnerability moves
our attention away from the incumbent to the challenger. If there are
almost always vulnerabilities in the incumbent’s position, why then are
they not taken advantage of? The answer is that entrenchment is the joint
product of the structure of the incumbent regime and the failures of rival
agents. The rhythm of political change is produced by the interaction
of the problems and puzzles generated by the dominant regime with the
problem-solving and adaptation of their opponents.
Theorists of path dependence made a significant breakthrough in understanding
large-scale political change when they observed that macrostructural
stimuli like changing world economic conditions or electoral
shocks did not influence countries, or policy areas within countries,
equally.6 The structure of inherited policy commitments or national institutional
forms, they argued, substantially mediated the impact of these
structural forces. While this was a major step forward in political analysis,
it only added one deterministic variable on top of another: instead of
electoral power or macroeconomic conditions determining policy outcomes,
the structure of inherited commitments did. The losers in this
model simply disappear from view, but as the examples in this book show,
losers have substantial room for effective action, even when faced with
seemingly imposing constraints on change. Strategically sophisticated losers
in one period can invest resources in such a way that they are able to
erode the disadvantages they will face in the future.7
In Paul Pierson’s work, special attention is put on the phenomenon of
myopia: much of the cause of entrenchment is the focus actors place on
the short term, since in the short term it almost always makes sense to
CONCLUSION 271

pursue marginal gains within an existing regime rather than challenging
it. Myopia, however, is a variable rather than a constant, as the examples
of long-range behavior in this book make clear. For example, intellectual
entrepreneurs at Chicago like Simons and Director made the University
into a safe space—an “abeyance structure”—for free market thought at
a time when most academic institutions were either hostile or uninterested.
In other words, they invested their time and sought out resources
for activities designed in the hope that the opportunity structure in the
future would be more open than it was in the present. The patrons of
the first generation of conservative public interest law, by contrast, invested
in activities closely tied to their own firms’ short-term bottom
line. The returns on their myopic political investments were correspondingly
meager.
The patrons of the second generation, by contrast, were willing to wait
much longer for their returns. They invested in law and economics in the
hopes that it would provide ammunition to defend free markets at some
indefinite time in the future and that it would help—in a way that was
not entirely clear to them—to shift the balance in law schools. They invested
in the Federalist Society, despite the fact that the organization’s
main outputs, such as networks and idea development, were difficult to
measure or trace back to their source and would only bear fruit decades
later, when generations of law students matured into senior, practicing
lawyers and law professors. They invested in Chip Mellor’s Center for
Applied Jurisprudence, despite the fact that it was a planning exercise for
a firm that did not yet exist and that did not open up shop for another
six years. There was nothing dramatically new about the opportunity
structure in the 1980s and 1990s where any of these activities were concerned.
Instead, change happened because, by that point, a new network
of entrepreneurial agents recognized previously ignored strategic opportunities,
had plausible plans for how to take advantage of them, and identified
long-term oriented patrons willing to bankroll their ideas.
In short, there are always more opportunities floating around a political
system than there are actors with the acuity to recognize them or the
capacity to effectively exploit them. It is this surplus of opportunities that
provides a tempting playing field for organizational entrepreneurs. Skill
matters in exploiting these opportunities, but skillful agents are a very
scarce commodity, which means there will often be very significant “big
bills left on the sidewalk” of political competition.8 The first generation
of public interest law shows what can happen when abundant resources
chase too few effective agents, or when those agents are embedded in
organizational structures in which creative activity is impossible.
One final point about the sources of long-term change emerges from
the examples of the previous chapters: the importance of networks and

information. An effective process of learning is vital for political movements
seeking to erode entrenched regimes, but learning happens most
productively through carefully nurtured networks that facilitate multiple,
ongoing interactions by movement actors. Understanding learning, therefore,
means understanding the structures in which it occurs. Learning depends
on the free flow of information, since the consequences of past
experiences need to be quickly conveyed to other agents, compared, and
lessons drawn and disseminated. For this to occur, agents need abundant,
credible, and reliable information. Where information flow is slow, unreliable,
or poorly structured, lesson-drawing will be hampered and experiences
will not flow back into subsequent decision-making.
The key to the diffusion of information and the drawing of effective
lessons is the development of networks and structured processes for feedback.
Networks are often described as emerging through a spontaneous,
evolutionary process, but some of the most important networks are the
result of conscious design and construction by network entrepreneurs.
For example, chapter 5 showed how the debates, meetings, and conventions
of the Federalist Society produce powerful networks of conservative
lawyers because they create the opportunity for repeated interactions over
time and because the ethos of the organization encourages trust. A number
of the professors I interviewed for chapter 4 insisted that, in the 1970s,
Henry Manne’s seminars for law professors and Liberty Fund conferences
helped produce networks among the otherwise thinly scattered group of
scholars in the field. These meetings allowed for the development, among
other things, of personal reputations. For example, the Liberty Fund conferences
helped George Priest, then at the obscure University of Puget
Sound Law School, to get on the elite legal academy’s radar screen, eventually
helping him land at Yale Law School.
Information and lesson-drawing also occur through formal processes of
feedback, processes that are of special interest to foundation patrons because
of their keen interest in evaluating their political investments. The
Horowitz Report was solicited by the Scaife Foundation to provide an unvarnished
look at conservative public interest law, and the report’s lessons
deeply impressed themselves on the major conservative patrons. Building
on Horowitz’s arguments, Mellor’s Center for Applied Jurisprudence
(funded by the Koch, Bradley, Olin, and Smith Richardson foundations)
brought together a wide range of figures in law and other disciplines to
consciously think through the experience of conservative public interest
law and to identify opportunities and organizational forms that might
make it more successful in the future. IJ’s emphasis on black empowerment
instead of race neutrality, for example, can be traced to these sessions.
Conservative foundations were well suited to acquiring information
and feeding it back into movement programming. The conservative pa-
CONCLUSION 273

tronage strategy of “spread betting”—supporting a wide range of projects
and then reinvesting in those that worked—required leaders with the experience
to effectively evaluate the success of movement ventures. The
continuity of foundation leadership—Michael Joyce, James Piereson, and
Richard Larry each served for a quarter-century—meant that there were
people in critical positions with long, personal experience with the movement’s
political entrepreneurs. The networks they built increased their
access to reliable information, and their position far up on the learning
curve meant that they were in a strong position to draw lessons and,
through their disbursement of money, to make those lessons stick.
The key claim of this section is that the durability of a policy or institutional
regime is determined in large part by the ability of its rivals to
discover or implement an effective response. Through the 1970s and
well into the 1980s, the liberal legal regime thrived, despite its weakening
electoral support, because conservatives found it difficult to develop
organizational capacity in the academy, the legal profession, and public
interest law. Since that time, conservatives have dramatically improved
their effectiveness in elite organizational mobilization. As a consequence,
they have rendered competitive areas of the law that were once
effectively monopolistic.
What conservatives have not been able to do is move beyond competition
to actually displace the liberal legal network and construct a dominant
regime of their own. Movement investments like the Olin programs
in law and economics helped increase the number of conservatives on
elite law school faculties, but they still remain a relatively small minority.
Conservatives’ one significant effort to create a noteworthy law school of
their own, at George Mason University, has been remarkably successful
given its modest founding but is nowhere close to challenging the legal
academic elite. Conservatives have a deeper bench of public interest law
firms than twenty years ago, but few of their rivals—the NAACP LDF,
ACLU, Environmental Defense Fund, Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, and Natural Resources Defense Council—have
disappeared or even been markedly weakened. The Federalist Society has
taken on many of the functions of the organized bar, but conservatives
have not attained significant power within the ABA or AALS, and both
organizations continue to draw conservatives’ ire. This same pattern of
competition rather than hegemony can be seen in a variety of other areas
outside the law, such as Social Security, education, and the environment.9
At the same time, legal liberals have captured little, if any, new institutional
or ideational turf since the early 1970s. Largely as a consequence
of the increasing effectiveness of conservative organizational mobilization,
their energies have been devoted increasingly to holding on to what
they already have.
274 CONCLUSION

What this pattern of effective conservative mobilization without significant
displacement of liberalism may point to are the diminishing possibilities
for regime construction in modern American politics. Partisans of
realignment theory once believed that American politics always featured
a dominant “sun” party and a reactive “moon” party.10 This metaphor
no longer accurately describes American politics, which is increasingly
characterized by two equally competitive parties, each capable of deploying
resources in civil society as well as in Washington, D.C. This heightened
level of organizational mobilization means that any competitive advantage
possessed by one party—whether it be electoral, social, or even
religious—will lead to the rapid development of organizational infrastructure
to challenge it.11 While political agents continue to try to create durable
regimes in institutions and policy domains, competitive pressures have
become sufficiently robust that the returns on investing in regime status
are lower than in the past. The failed attempt by Karl Rove to create a
durable Republican Party regime of the kind built by Mark Hanna and
William McKinley in the late nineteenth century is just the most visible
example of the difficulty faced by regime builders in an organizationally
competitive political system. Increasingly, therefore, our politics is characterized
by the absence of a dominant party, an era without a regime, in
which political time has dramatically sped up: what, in another context,
Stephen Skowronek called a “politics of permanent preemption.”12 If anything,
this condition is even more profound than Skowronek’s argument
would lead us to believe, because the tight competition that produces the
reactive, preemptive modern style of politics now characterizes civil society
and organizational mobilization as well as elections.

Understanding Modern Conservatism

In the late 1960s, conservatism was still a movement tightly linked to, and
governed by, the interests of business, grassroots activists, and Republican
elected officials. These interests are still vital parts of modern conservatism,
but they have been increasingly joined by, and in some cases rendered
subordinate to, a network of conservative organizations whose
members are primarily motivated by ideological principle rather than coalitional
affiliations. In the process of adding this ideologically motivated
stratum to the conservative movement, and in responding to the challenge
of liberal entrenchment, conservatism was transformed philosophically
and strategically as well as organizationally. This section briefly sums up
the book’s findings on this transformation and lays the groundwork for
the discussion of the larger lessons of the conservative experience with
elite mobilization, the subject of the third and final section.
CONCLUSION 275

In the early 1970s, conservative ideas and political strategy were animated
by the belief that the genie of legal liberalism could be put back in
the bottle. This hope led to conservative support for “judicial restraint”
or “strict constructionism,” concepts borrowed from an earlier generation
of liberal thought. These ideas argued for a strictly limited role for
federal courts in public policy, claiming that the activist judiciary of the
Warren Court was inconsistent with democratic rule. Decades earlier, conservatives
had been attracted to quite a different judicial philosophy,
which saw the courts as a bulwark against a democratic mob that, if given
free rein, would destroy private property and centralize power in a strong
national state. Judicial restraint was a fundamentally negative idea, a theory
about what courts should not do, rather than what they ought to do.
This philosophy became increasingly unattractive to conservatives as the
federal courts and the legal profession became increasingly influenced by
liberalism, and as conservatism became a more populist movement. The
political strategy that accompanied judicial restraint was placing believers
in “strict construction” on the federal bench and creating conservative
public interest groups to present the “other side” when liberals sought to
use the courts to advance their policy goals. Together, the idea of judicial
restraint, a reconfigured federal judiciary, and public interest lawyers capable
of balancing out the information available to judges, would resurrect
the constitutional status quo ante, before the disruptions of Brown,
Griswold, Goldberg, and the like.
The professional and ideational entrenchment of legal liberalism made
it impossible to turn the clock back, and so conservatives were forced to
adapt to the structure of the regime they sought to displace. First, conservatives
learned that they needed to adapt many of their rivals’ organizational
forms. Whereas conservatives’ strength was in grassroots and business
mobilization at the state and local level, they were forced to build
up their elite infrastructure in Washington, D.C. Ironically, to counter
centralization, conservatives had to centralize their own organizational
apparatus. Second, conservatives learned that they could not simply create
alternatives to institutions controlled by liberals, but would have to
organize within them. The reputations of academic institutions, for example,
are highly sticky, and their role in conveying distinction very difficult,
if not impossible, to replicate. As a result, conservatives sought out ways
to operate inside of institutions where they were unwelcome. In the process,
however, they had to play by the rules created by their rivals. Third,
while most conservatives were suspicious of the central place of civil rights
and an activist judiciary in American legal culture, these had become so
deeply entrenched that conservatives had to find ways to adapt them for
their own purposes. The symbolic stature of Brown meant that conservatives
needed to adjust to its standard of justification, by arguing that their
276 CONCLUSION

goals—like school choice—were truer to Brown’s egalitarian aspirations
than those of their liberal counterparts. This strategic necessity provided
an opening for conservatives who genuinely believed in a vigorous role
for the courts and the moral idea of civil rights—like the founders of IJ—
to drag the conservative legal movement in their direction. This philosophical
shift went hand in hand with the discovery that the tools of public
interest law were more suited to challenging government authority
than defending it. The shift of conservative public interest law to libertarianism,
therefore, can be understood as an endogenous adaptation to legal
liberalism’s transformation of American law.
These adaptations were accompanied by a shift of power within the
conservative legal movement, from grassroots activists, Republican politicians,
and business to a “new class” of legal professionals and academics.
Where the first generation of conservative public interest law was dominated
by business, second-generation firms were led by lawyers and intellectuals
whose primary commitment was to ideological principle and a
standard of legal professionalism. The Federalist Society was rooted in
law schools, not party politics, fired by a mission of creating a conservative
legal establishment with distinguished credentials, and armed with
ideas that the legal academy could not ignore.
The coming to power of the conservative new class was a necessary—
albeit not uncontested—adaptation to the character of the American legal
profession and the competitive demands of responding to legal liberalism.
The technical and intellectual character of modern law and the importance
of prestige and distinction in the legal profession meant that, in
order to be taken seriously by the profession, conservatives had to develop
a network of experts with command over a wide range of issues and processes,
the respect of mainstream lawyers and academics, and markers of
professional distinction. In addition, countering the liberal legal network
required a deep familiarity with its strategy, organizations, and ideas that
could only come from a cadre of leaders drawn from the same professional
background as their adversaries. Finally, the development of a conservative
new class was necessary to convince potential elite recruits to the
cause that legal professionalism was consistent with conservative ideas.
However functional we might think these changes in conservatism
were, none were obvious or automatic, and most emerged only very gradually
and after a great deal of trial and error. Too often, the story of
modern conservatism has been told through the “myth of diabolical competence.”
Oddly enough, this myth has characterized accounts of conservatism
written on the left and the right. Focusing primarily on conservatives’
successes, this myth tells a tale of conservative movement actors
who carefully and strategically planned out an assault on liberalism, an
assault that was almost always successful. This approach, by focusing on
CONCLUSION 277

the programs that succeeded while ignoring those that failed, is guilty of
survivor bias. It is true that conservatives have, in many cases, showed
significant strategic acumen. But the lessons of the first generation of conservative
public interest law show that the movement went through a
very long period of almost complete organizational failure. Conservative
philanthropists invested very substantial sums in Henry Manne’s entrepreneurial
activities on behalf of law and economics, only to pull back
sharply just as he was at the cusp of creating a major new piece of the
conservative organizational infrastructure. CIR’s strategy of attacking affirmative
action and defending free speech on college campuses may seem
far-sighted and strategic now, but it was nowhere to be found in its original
plans. While the conservative movement has had its very considerable
strengths, it was never a monolith, often made serious errors, and succeeded
by shrewd adaptation rather than by the far-sighted pursuit of a
grand plan.

Lessons from Conservatives

What lessons, if any, does the history of conservative legal mobilization
hold for political entrepreneurs and patrons in the future? This question
has, of late, been a matter of some urgency for liberals in particular. Liberal
donors have pored over studies of how conservatives built their policy
infrastructure in the hopes of replicating their accomplishments.13 Most
of these analyses, unfortunately, have been based on publicly available
information and thus lacked a nuanced sense of the challenges actually
faced by conservative patrons and entrepreneurs or the way that they
responded to them. Serious political learning, by contrast, requires a view
from the inside, and with it an effort to empathize with the challenges
faced by the actors from whom one wishes to learn. This final section
sums up the lessons for political activists that I have drawn from the development
of the conservative legal movement, as well as suggesting some
limits on lesson-drawing.
The most serious mistake those seeking to learn from legal conservatives
could make would be to create carbon copies of conservatives’ organizational
apparatus, mimicking rather than learning. The most successful
conservative projects, such as the Federalist Society, were adaptations
to specific weaknesses of the conservative movement and responses to the
character of liberal entrenchment. By the late 1970s and early 1980s,
conservatives were strong at the grass roots, but lacked dense networks
in Washington and representation in the elite strata of the legal profession.
Their ideas were taken very seriously in the everyday world of electoral
politics, but lacked legitimacy in the highest ranks of the legal academy.
278 CONCLUSION

While they were increasingly integrated into American culture and politics,
conservatives felt like strangers in the elite ranks of the legal academy
and organized bar. The structure of the Federalist Society made unquestionably
good sense as a response to these specific problems and as a way
to maneuver through institutions that were controlled by their rivals. The
success of the Federalist Society, however, does not mean that it can be
cloned, for actors today face a very different set of challenges than conservatives
did. So, for example, legal liberals remain very strong in the elite
circles of the legal profession and continue to be well networked in Washington,
but they are weak in grassroots mobilization, and their elite organizations
have few thick connections to mass organizations.14 Their ideas
continue to possess unquestioned legitimacy in elite circles, even as they
have lost their grip on the public imagination and become in some cases
the object of ridicule. Legal liberals can still call law schools their home,
even as they have become more and more isolated in American culture.
To the degree that liberals invest resources replicating conservative organizations
designed for problems different from the ones they face today,
they will waste money, time, and human capital.
That does not mean that there are no lessons of general applicability
from the conservative organizational mobilization in the law. The first is
the need for honesty. Conservatives were willing to face, at times brutally,
the ideational and organizational weaknesses of the movement. The Horowitz
Report, for example, was a major turning point for conservatives
because it laid bare the manifest inadequacies of the movement, criticizing
almost the entirety of the conservative infrastructure in the law, and did
so directly to the holders of the movement’s purse strings. As painful as
they were, these sharp criticisms primed conservative patrons for new
kinds of organizations, led by new kinds of leaders. Those seeking to learn
from conservatives would be well served, therefore, by being open to the
possibility of failure.
The conservative experience also suggests that little significant change
is likely to come from existing organizations or leaders. Mellor and
Bolick at IJ and Greve and McDonald at CIR had been miserable at
MSLF and the Washington Legal Foundation because cases that represented
real opportunities for legal conservatism, such as the Denver
cable case and the cause of Thomas Lamprecht, could not be effectively
pursued within their organizational confines. Change came instead from
new organizations, and their predecessors only changed much later, if at
all.15 This suggests that political movements need to anticipate, and, in
fact, encourage, a significant degree of creative destruction in their own
organizational apparatus if they are to quickly and effectively develop
more effective responses.
CONCLUSION 279

The history of the conservative legal movement suggests that successful
political patrons engage in spread betting combined with feedback
and learning, rather than expecting too much from grand planning.16
Conservatives’ learning and feedback did not, however, involve using
narrow, technical forms of evaluation. Conservative patrons were willing
to accept fairly diffuse, hard-to-measure goals with long-term payoffs
when they had faith in the individuals behind the projects. This
goes against the grain of much of contemporary philanthropy, which
emphasizes rigorous, usually quantitative, evaluative measurement.
Conservative patrons were typically quite close to the entrepreneurs they
funded and depended on their own subjective evaluation of both a given
entrepreneur’s effectiveness and the information that flowed through
trusted movement networks—rather than on “objective” measures of
outcomes. Where goals such as transforming the climate of opinion are
concerned, this form of subjective evaluation may be more effective than
seemingly precise measures that often leave out the most important, albeit
difficult-to-measure, outcomes.
Legal conservatives did not achieve as much as they have simply by
more effectively packaging or marketing their ideas. Instead, conservatives
became more effective by challenging, and ultimately changing, their
ideas. Decades of debate in Federalist Society conferences and within the
network of conservative scholars led to jettisoning the concepts of judicial
restraint and strict constructionism, and then original intent, before finally
settling (at least provisionally) on “original meaning.” Where legal
conservatives in the early 1970s were focused on limiting the implications
of Brown, the new generation of legal conservatives such as Clint Bolick
of IJ openly embraced the more radical “antisubordination” interpretation
of Brown, while disagreeing vigorously with liberals about its implications.17
The conservative legal movement took ideas very seriously, and
its patrons invested significant resources in serious, first-order discussion
of fundamental commitments with little if any short-term payoffs. While
many contemporary liberals seem obsessed with creating their own think
tanks to allow for “instant response,” conservatives recognized the need
to go back to “first things.” This was reflected, for instance, in the Federalist
Society’s convention norms that panels should include debates among
conservatives, as well as with liberals.
Conservatives, therefore, were willing to carve out enough space from
the movement’s old categories, commitments, and constituencies to allow
serious intellectual discussion and argumentation, leading to a reconsideration
of ideas, strategies, and alliances. This suggests that political movements
need organizations and norms of deliberation that allow members
to argue fervently among one another on matters of fundamental principle.
Going back to first things also meant that conservatives were willing
280 CONCLUSION

to distance themselves from their existing constituencies, even when this
meant challenging their allies’ short-term interests. Conservatives went
out of their way to find cases that put them on the other side of business
or that appealed to constituencies, such as inner-city blacks, who were
outside of the conservative coalition. The willingness of intellectuals to
reconsider fundamental principles went hand in hand with using litigation
to reach out to new groups as part of a strategy of reshaping the movement’s
reputation. Conservatives used strategic litigation to reshape perceptions
that they were greedy, callous, captured by big business, and
uninterested in the cause of racial justice. In the process, they reached out
to new constituents by organizing around new issues. The willingness
to experiment with new organizational approaches that is essential to
organizational entrepreneurship, therefore, is most likely to come out of
an environment of intellectual openness.
Perhaps one of the most common mistakes that have been made by
those who have attempted to learn from the conservative legal movement
has been the tendency to confuse direct organizational goals and the desired
by-products of activities with other ends. The Manne programs in
the 1970s and 1980s and the lectures and conventions of the Federalist
Society, for example, contributed mightily to the development of academic
and professional networks. These networks spurred intellectual
productivity, improved the information that conservatives could access in
government, and assisted in identifying ideological sympathizers when
staffing the federal judiciary and administrative agencies. As important as
these outputs were, however, they were by-products, or external benefits,
of activities and organizations that worked because they were not aimed
directly at these goals. Professors and judges attended Manne’s seminars
because they were deeply intellectually stimulating, and, despite the unquestioned
presence of opportunists within its ranks, such stimulation
remains the main force drawing lawyers and law students to Federalist
Society meetings. Strong networks of the kind that came from these programs
developed because of the emotional and intellectual intensity that
comes from an activity that knits people together and not because the
organizations serve instrumental goals for their members. Even when the
objective of organizational mobilization is narrowly political, therefore,
it may be more effectively pursued through means that are broader and
more indirect.
The final lesson to be drawn from the conservative legal experience
concerns the relationship between structure and agency and is relevant to
both social scientists and political activists. At any one time, the constraints
of an existing regime can seem crushing and inescapable, frustrating
the ability of individuals to create change of any consequence in the
CONCLUSION 281

world. The constraints and structures of any particular period are, however,
often the creation of a previous generation’s political agents. In the
short term, politics is, in fact, a world of constraints, but to agents willing
to wait for effects that may not emerge for decades, the world is rich with
opportunity. Activists would do well to learn from, and act upon, these
examples of long-term effects. So, too, political scientists would serve
their discipline well by taking the time to study them.

8. There is one significant segment of the conservative countermobilization in
the law that I do not examine directly in this book, and that is religious conservatives.
The reasons for this are more practical than theoretical. First, there is already
an excellent study of the subject, Steven Brown’s Trumping Religion: The Christian
Right, the Free Speech Clause, and the Courts (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama
Press, 2003). Second, I do not believe that I could have obtained access to
the kind of “inside” materials on religious conservatives that I have obtained on
the rest of the conservative movement. Third, I lack the intellectual background,
especially on the substance of American religious thought and organization, to do
the subject justice. That said, I do believe that substantial work remains to be
done on the subject, and that my emphasis on strategic choice and organizational
development would add considerably to the foundation laid by Brown.

16. John Skrentny observes, for example, that when the Bilingual American
Education Act was passed in 1967, “No one spoke out against bilingual education,
either as a violation of American assimilationist ideals or as a pedagogy that
would not or may not work.” Skrentny, The Minority Rights Revolution, 204.
17. This broader understanding of party actors has similarities to the concept
of the “political block” used by David Plotke in Building a Democratic Political
Order: Reshaping American Liberalism in the 1930s and 1940s (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1996). An account that makes activists a central component
of the modern political party, and that attributes a significant degree of
contemporary party polarization to them, is John Aldrich, in Why Parties?: The
Origin and Transformation of Political Parties in America (Chicago: University
of Chicago Press, 1995), chapter 6.
18. The most concrete example of this incorporation of interest groups into
the party system in contemporary politics is the Republican Party’s “K Street project,”
and Grover Norquist’s “Wednesday Meeting” of conservative activists, but
this coordination of interest group and party activity has now become an institutionalized
feature of American politics across the political spectrum. See Nicholas

25. Jack Balkin and Sanford Levinson, “Understanding the Constitutional
Revolution,” Virginia Law Review 87, no. 6 (2001): 1045–1104. A similar argument
is made by David Adamany, who emphasizes that the Supreme Court is most
likely to come into conflict with rising partisan coalitions at precisely the moment
when their legitimacy is most in doubt—in their early years. Thus, far from serving
the legitimating function that Dahl pointed to, the Supreme Court tends to erode
the legitimacy of rising political orders. David Adamany, “Legitimacy, Realigning

York: Cambridge University Press, 1982). Because I believe the concepts to be
roughly similar, I will use the terms interchangeably.

38. David Yalof provides persuasive evidence that President Nixon found it
very difficult to identify potential Supreme Court nominees, because of the shallow
pool of viable conservative nominees and the weakness of the network that
his attorney general could draw upon in identifying them. David Yalof, Pursuit
N O T E S T O P A G E S 13–16 291

of Justices: Presidential Politics and the Selection of Supreme Court Nominees
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), 97–132. The nomination of Sandra
Day O’Connor, at the height of Ronald Reagan’s political power, can also be
seen as an example of the consequences of a president being forced to make an
ideologically uncertain nomination because of the thin pool of judicial candidates
from which to draw. A strong network will also enhance the ability of the president
to make “stealth” nominations to the bench when his own coalition has
“private” information not accessible to opponents.
39. This reproductive process will be limited by competitive pressures from
rival law schools (which are, for the top law schools, somewhat muted because
of the force of reputation and financial endowment) and the desire to hire former
Supreme Court clerks as professors (which will be influenced by the partisan
makeup of the Court). The latter pressure may have declined with the increasing
importance of publications and joint degrees in initial legal academic hiring.

43. While Paul Pierson has urged us to think of structures as the consequence
of actions earlier in a temporal sequence, he has, to my mind, underplayed the
importance that conscious agent action can play in producing structures in future
periods. The difference here is one of emphasis—Pierson sees structures as largely
the result of accidents, while my approach emphasizes those that are the product
of conscious political investment, defined as the expenditure of resources in one
period designed to produce returns in future periods. Put another way, path dependence
can be the product of agents oriented to the long term. Paul Pierson, Thinking
in Time (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2004).

problem is Walker, Mobilizing Interest Groups. Walker was responding in this
work primarily to Mancur Olson, whose The Logic of Collective Action (Cambridge:

294 N O T E S T O P A G E S 19–27

ests would form groups with relative ease, it would be almost impossible for more
diffuse interests to do so (with the exception of groups capable of providing selective
incentives for membership).

received support from patrons were more than two and a half times as likely to

86. “Between 1957 and 1970, entering students at each school we studied became
increasingly liberal or radical. Combining percentages of ‘far left’ and ‘liberal’
students the Yale aggregate rose from 56 percent in the class of 1960 to 80
percent in the Class of 1972. By 1972, no less than 32 percent of the Yale entering
class described themselves as ‘far left,’ a percentage at least twice as large as that
at any other school. By 1972 ‘moderates’ and ‘conservatives’ could muster only
13 percent of the entering Yale class; in the Class of 1960, 40 percent of the Yale
respondents had put themselves in those categories. At the remaining schools, the
percentage of ‘far left’ and ‘liberal’ students had risen dramatically, but about
half of the 1970 and 1972 classes still thought of themselves as ‘moderate’ or
‘conservative.’. . . Legal education and liberal or radical political views appear to
be related. While the great majority of students tended to retain the same political
outlook they had on entering law school, among those whose political philosophies
shifted, 65 percent moved leftward. The liberalizing tendency was most perceptible
in two instances. First, over a fifth of those who entered law school with
a moderate political outlook characterized themselves as ‘liberals’ on graduation.
Second, almost as large a percentage with a conservative political perspective on
entering law school emerged viewing themselves as ‘moderates.’ ” Stevens, “Law
Schools and Law Students,” 583–84.

89. Between 1974–75 and 1984–85, the number of electives in “discrimination
in the law” in American law schools increased by 92.9 percent, while electives in
natural resources and the environment increased by 20 percent, on top of what
appears to have been very substantial growth in the years just before. That said,
electives in patent, copyright, and trademark leaped 115.6 percent. William Powers,

consultant on Legal Education to the American Bar Association, 1987), 36. The
new classes that reflected more liberal priorities were, in effect, layered onto the
old law school curricula, rather than fundamentally altering it.

only when it is strategically focused and combined with actual control over litigation,
in particular the choice of client and venue. Furthermore, Paul Collins has

that amici provide to the court, that leads to their (fairly small) impact. Paul

was specifically this nonconservative temperament that Horowitz sought to deploy
for conservative ends.

Chapter 4
Law and Economics I: Out of the Wilderness

1. In the terms of the social movement literature, the University of Chicago
served as an “abeyance structure” for the movement. Taylor defines the term abeyance
as a “holding process by which movements sustain themselves in nonreceptive
political environments and provide continuity from one state of mobilization
to another.” For classical economics, that “nonreceptive” period lasted from
the 1930s to the 1960s, and the existence of the University allowed classical economic
ideas to develop despite their unpopularity, so that they were available
when the political tides changed. Verta Taylor, “Social Movement Continuity:
The Women’s Movement in Abeyance,” American Sociological Review 54, no. 5

place within the conservative movement, might emphasize the work of Guido
Calabresi and the “Yale School” as much as I emphasize Posner and Chicago.

lawyers in the area. The school’s heavy dependence on the stock price of Xerox
and Eastman Kodak may have played a role after Manne left, but during the time
he was there the price of both companies increased considerably.

Law School, “Subject: Report of the Dean Search Committee to the Faculty,”
October 30, 1979. This memo reported that “Henry Manne informed the Com-
N O T E S T O P A G E S 118–121 311

mittee that he regularly is contacted about his interest in being a Dean at other
law schools. He has told all the schools that he has no interest unless they wish
to bid for the Law and Economics Center. His asking price is $1,000,000 and two
schools are interested, but he expects they will not make a firm offer. In any case,
if a Dean who is committed to building a law and economics program is appointed
at Miami, it would take a good deal more to attract him to another school.” It
should be noted that this memo was written at a time when Manne was in substantial
conflict with the administrators writing the minutes, so at the very least the
tone may have been overstated. Manne in fact specifically challenged most of its
claims, including that the LEC had an “asking price” of $1 million in a letter to
the dean on November 9, 1979. Among the schools that had shown some interest
in Manne was Cornell, an incident that is discussed in detail in chapter 6.

91. The impact of UVA and USC on the penetration of law and economics into
elite institutions can be seen, for example, at Yale, NYU, and Chicago. Six of their
most prestigious professors—Robert Ellickson (USC, 1970–81), Michael Graetz
(UVA, 1972–79, USC, 1979–83); Jerry Mashaw (UVA, 1968–76), Allen Schwartz
(USC, 1976–87), Richard Epstein (USC, 1968–73), and Michael Levine (USC,
1968–87)—spent a significant part of their early careers at UVA or USC. UVA has
done better at retaining its top figures in law and economics from this period,
such as Lillian BeVier, Michael Dooley, and Charles Goetz. This list could also
include Warren Schwartz of Georgetown and Robert Scott of Columbia, both of
whom were at UVA in the 1970s (Scott left for Columbia in 2006). Early adoption
of law and economics appears to have had a bottom-line effect on the status of
the respective law schools. In the most recent US News rankings, UVA ranked 10
and USC 16, considerably above the level of their undergraduate counterparts (24
and 27, respectively).

works that focused on explaining political failure were: James Buchanan and
Richard Wagner, Democracy in Deficit: The Political Legacy of Lord Keynes

Government (Chicago: Aldine, Atherton, 1971); Roger Noll, “The Nature

99. Among the most important Caltech public choice scholars were John Ferejohn,
Morris Fiorina, Charles Plott, Lance Davis, and Roger Noll; its faculty also
included important non-public-choice scholars Morgan Kousser and Bruce Cain.
100. Levine, “Law and . . .” A good example of the outcome of this relationship
with Caltech is Michael Levine and Charles Plott, “Agenda Influence and Its
Implications,” Virginia Law Review 63, no. 4 (1977): 561–604. At UVA, an early
example of economist-lawyer collaboration using public choice is Jerry Mashaw,
Charles Goetz, F. Goodman, Warren Schwartz, et. al., Social Security Hearings
and Appeals: A study of the Social Security Administration Hearing System (Lexington,
Mass.: Lexington Books, 1978).
101. Mashaw begins his book Greed, Chaos and Governance: Using Public
Choice to Improve Public Law (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997) by recalling
that “our monthly meetings in the early 1970s alternated between Charlottesville
and Blacksburg. Papers were read. Wine was drunk. Argument lasted
deep into the night” (vii).

of crime, especially “The Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment—A Question of

103. Liquidated damages are a mechanism to encourage contractual compliance,
whereby the damages to be paid if one or the other party violates contractual
conditions are specified in the contract. The article was Charles Goetz and Robert
Scott, “Liquidated Damages, Penalties, and the Just Compensation Principle: A
Theory of Efficient Breach,” Columbia Law Review 77 (1977): 554.
104. This connection between clustering and increasing returns has been observed
in economic geography, as in Masahisa Fujita, Paul Krugman, and Anthony
Venables, The Spatial Economy (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001), and in the sociology
of ideas, as in Randall Collins, The Sociology of Philosophies (Cambridge:
Harvard University Press, 1998).
105. While admitting that the Manne programs had an important impact on
others, Scott recalls that “Graetz, Jeffries and I, looking back on it, behaved a
little badly. We didn’t take it quite as seriously as Henry wanted us to. . . . It was
the collection of very smart, productive scholars at Virginia at that time, the young
Turk, ambitious part of the faculty, that had the greatest influence on me, especially
in private law.” Scott interview.

sake of felicity of expression, I will simply use the term conservative to describe

drop in its programming in law schools (which are its primary mechanism of
campus recruitment) due to speakers’ reluctance to fly in the wake of the 9/11
attacks.
35. A number of one-half travel stipends are available for travel to the annual
student conference of the Society, chapter heads have their expenses covered for an

as in fund-raising letters sent out by the Society under his name. Along with Robert
Bork, he appears to be the figure with the strongest and most consistent support
for the Society’s fund-raising activities. For example, the five-year plan indicates
that Bork and Hatch were the cochairmen of the development push that
helped bring the Society’s budget to over a million dollars per annum. Federalist

73. The remarkable density of the Federalist Society’s networks is demonstrated
in Anthony Paik, Ann Southworth, and John Heinz, “Lawyers of the
Right: Networks and Organization,” Case Western Reserve University School of
Law Legal Studies Research Paper No. 06-10, May 2006, http://papers.ssrn.com/

74. Dinesh D’Souza, Letters to a Young Conservative (New York: Basic Books,
2002), 33–34.
75. On this point, consider a very early (August 20, 1984) letter from Eugene
Meyer to Michael Joyce of the Bradley Foundation, where he notes that, despite
the critical need to engage practicing lawyers for financial purposes, “we are convinced
that it is best to direct our efforts to involve the legal community as a whole
more toward the educational rather than the networking aspects.”
76. Society networks also increase the probability that conservatives can identify
other conservatives in the employment process, through the increasing the
number of “weak ties” within the movement. On the importance of weak ties in
employment, see Granovetter, “Strength of Weak Ties.”
77. Behavioral research has shown that discussions in groups organized on
ideological lines tends to produce greater polarization. See, for example, Cass R.
Sunstein, “Deliberative Trouble: Why Groups Go to Extremes,” Yale Law Journal
110, no. 1 (2000): 92–94. This suggests that the Society and its liberal sister, the
American Constitution Society, do not simply reflect ideological polarization, but
may help to accelerate it by increasing the frequency of personal interactions in
ideologically homogeneous settings.
78. One way of thinking about stigma is that it is the opposite of what Bourdieu
has called “distinction.” Reducing stigma is, consequently, a critical contribution
to building up the cultural capital of the movement. This concept is discussed
in greater detail in chapter 1.
79. This was true in the Society’s early years, one example of which is Russell
Van Patten, then-head of the Yale Federalist Society, who noted back in 1986 that
“there are a lot of closet Federalists.” Jill Abramson, “Right Place at the Right
Time,” American Lawyer, June 1986, 99.

88. Thomas P. Main to Eugene Meyer, January 3, 1984. Meyer responded to
this letter by noting that “it is very likely that a majority of the ABA’s membership
is to the right of the leadership and staff which are primarily responsible for the
organization’s public opinions. This also explains why the ABA’s political bias is
not as well known as it should be. I think this subject is worth a small monograph
. . .” Eugene Meyer to Thomas Main, January 23, 1984. After the defeat of the
Bork nomination, the Society would begin to increase its watchdog role vis-a`-vis
the ABA well beyond a “small monograph.”

Law and Economics II: Institutionalization

1. Morton Horwitz, “Law and Economics: Science or Politics?” Hofstra Law
Review 8, no. 4 (1980): 905.
2. As noted in chapter 1, the concept of an idea being “on” or “off the wall”
comes from Jack Balkin, “Bush v. Gore and the Boundary Between Law and Politics,”
Yale Law Journal 110, no. 8 (2001): 1407–58.
3. Survey evidence shows that economists are not, in any simple way, more
“conservative” than the general public—there are about as many questions where
economists are more liberal than the public than where they are more conservative.
The distinctions come in the composition of economists’ attitudes. Caplan
finds that, compared to the general public, economists “are even less worried
about high profits, executive pay, and downsizing, and are more likely to see both
downsizing and current economic disturbances as good on the whole. Economists
are also much more likely to accept a supply-and-demand explanation for the gas
price rise, and have more optimistic views of the quality of new jobs, and the
growth of real incomes and wages over the past 20 years. . . . [On the other hand,
they] worry even less about foreign aid, immigration, welfare, affirmative action,
and the work ethic.... Economists also have left-leaning perspectives on high
taxes, tax cuts, and female labor force participation, and right-leaning perspectives
on tax breaks, business investment in the workforce, and families’ need for
two incomes.” Bryan Caplan, “What Makes People Think Like Economists? Evidence
on Economic Cognition from the ‘Survey of Americans and Economists on
the Economy,’ ” Journal of Law and Economics 44, no. 2 (2001): 414. To the
degree that “lawyer-economists” share the preferences of disciplinary economics,
they will tend to share the social—and even redistributive—liberalism of their
colleagues in the legal academy, but will differ from the markedly in their preference
for market arrangement in the economy.

for aggressive grant-making were substantial.

29. Further evidence that the move toward libertarianism was driven by the
imperatives of American law, rather than the preferences of conservative activists,
can be seen in the shifting emphasis of religious conservative public interest lawyers.
Where they once focused on reviving older understandings of the establishment
clause, religious conservative PILFs have shifted their energies to the free
speech provisions of the First Amendment. In practice, this has led those firms to
move from defending to circumscribing the authority of local governments. In
the process, religious conservatives have increasingly drawn lessons from—and in
many cases drawn on the precedents created by—civil libertarians. This shift is
shrewdly described in Stephen Brown, Trumping Religion: The New Christian
Right, The First Amendment, and the Courts (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama
Press, 2004).
30. McDonald interview. McGuire had been employed by the Georgetown
Law Center admissions department in an administrative capacity. While working
N O T E S T O P A G E S 233–239 325

there, he examined the files of admitted applicants, and found a substantial gap
between the GPAs and LSAT scores of black and white students. He subsequently
published an article in the law school paper reporting his findings, which touched
off a ferocious debate, including demands for his expulsion. Ultimately, McGuire
and the law school settled on a reprimand for violating a duty of nondisclosure.
McGuire’s account of the issue can be found in Timothy McGuire, “My Bout
with Affirmative Action,” Commentary 93 (April 1992): 50–52.

influence and power in the political process, including large corporations and development
firms. As for the victims, the government now has license to transfer

107. The exception, of course, is IJ’s school choice litigation, but even that defended
the government authority to enact a libertarian policy.

Conclusion

1. Harold Hotelling, “Stability in Competition,” Economic Journal 39, no.
153 (1929): 41–57; Anthony Downs, An Economic Theory of Democracy (New
York: Harper and Row, 1957). There are other mechanisms for the production
of equilibrium. For example, Reva Siegel has argued, “If the constitutional law
that officials pronounce diverges too far from understandings to which American
N O T E S T O P A G E S 265–274 329

citizens subscribed, a mobilized citizenry knows how to hold judges and the
elected officials who appoint them to account.” Reva Siegel, “Constitutional Culture,
Social Movement Conflict and Constitutional Change: The Case of the de
facto ERA,” California Law Review 94, no. 5 (2006): 1419. In Siegel’s model,
mobilization and countermobilization ultimately move constitutional law back to
something like the equilibrium position of public values. This assumes, however,
that the challenges for the first movers and the countermobilizers are symmetric:
the key point of my argument is that they are not, and it is this asymmetry that
produces constitutional regimes.
2. Paul Pierson, Politics in Time: History, Institutions and Social Analysis
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2004).
3. Three examples of legislative erosion are the Personal Responsibility and
Work Opportunity Act of 1995, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996, and the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
4. Mine is an imprecise adaptation of the concept described at greatest detail
in William Baumol, John Panzar, and Robert Willig, Contestable Markets and the
Theory of Industry Structure, rev. ed. (New York: Harcourt, 1988). Baumol’s
account builds on, among others, Harold Demsetz, “Why Regulate Utilities?”
Journal of Law and Economics 11, no. 1 (1968): 55–65. The most important
part of these works, for my purposes, is that monopoly status is consistent with
vulnerability to competition.
5. Kathleen Thelen, “Historical Institutionalism in Comparative Politics,” Annual
Review of Political Science 2 (1999): 369–404.
6. Peter Hall and David Soskice, eds., Varieties of Capitalism: The Institutional
Foundations of Comparative Advantage (Oxford: Oxford University Press,
2001); Paul Pierson, Dismantling the Welfare State? (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1994).
7. Teles, “Conservative Mobilization”; Teles and Prinz, “Politics of Rights Retraction”;
Teles, Whose Welfare?, chapter 7.
8. The phrase, and the concept behind it, come from Mancur Olson, “Distinguished
Lecture on Economics in Government: Big Bills Left on the Sidewalk:
Why Some Nations are Rich, and Others Poor,” Journal of Economic Perspectives
10, no. 2 (1996): 3–24. On the importance of skill in political entrepreneurship,
see Adam Sheingate, “The Terrain of the Political Entrepreneur,” in Formative
Acts: Reckoning with Agency in American Politics, ed. Stephen Skowronek and
Matthew Glassman (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007).
9. The achievements, and limitations, of conservatives in these areas are
discussed in detail in Glenn and Teles, Conservatism and American Political
Development.
10. Samuel Lubell, The Future of American Politics (New York: Harper and
Row, 1952).
11. The Democratic Party’s attempt to reverse Republican’s competitive advantage
among the religious can be seen in the enormous efforts that have been
devoted to creating a recognizable “religious Left.” See, for example, Cayle Murphy
and Alan Cooperman, “Religious Liberals Gain New Visibility,” Washington
Post, May 20, 2006, A1.

Magazine, July 25, 2004. Some of the mistakes that have come from this effort
to learn from conservatives are described in Ari Berman, “Big $$ for Progressive
Politics,” The Nation, October 16, 2006.
14. Skocpol, Diminished Democracy.
15. Clayton Christensen shows a similar pattern in the introduction of new
technologies, in which “disruptive innovations” are almost always adopted by
new firms, rather than by existing market leaders. Clayton Christensen, The Innovator’s
Dilemma (New York: HarperCollins, 2003).
16. The importance of learning from failure in philanthropy is discussed in
depth in Peter Frumkin, Strategic Philanthropy: The Art and Science of Philanthropy
(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006).
17. The distinction between “anticlassification” and “antisubordination” is
laid out in Balkin and Siegel, “American Civil Rights Tradition.”
