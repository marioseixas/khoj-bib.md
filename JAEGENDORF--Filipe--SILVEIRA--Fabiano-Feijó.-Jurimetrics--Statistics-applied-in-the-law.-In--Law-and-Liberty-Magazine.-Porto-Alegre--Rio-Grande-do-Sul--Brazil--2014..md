ABSTRACT: This article reviews the available literature on Jurimetry, as well as relevant considerations and
suggestions for practical and theoretical applications of the subject. It proposes the division of Jurimetry into three
prisms, allowing a broad and direct approach for anyone interested in using quantitative tools in Law. A connection is
made between the institutes of Law and Statistics, in order to make the immediate application of quantitative methods
in legal matters. The examples presented have a theoretical and applied character, demonstrating in part the
applicability of the theme in different contexts, raising fundamental questions for the modern use in Brazilian Law.
