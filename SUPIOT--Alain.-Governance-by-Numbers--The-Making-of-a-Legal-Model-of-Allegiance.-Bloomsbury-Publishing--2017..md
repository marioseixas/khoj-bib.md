Alain SUPIOT, Governance by Numbers: The Making
of a Legal Model of Allegiance (Oxford/Portland OR,
Bloomsbury Publishing, 2017)

The president of Rutgers University, a large public American
university recently wrote a column in its alumni magazine titled,
“For Good, Measure.” In it he described how the university was
“using metrics to ensure it stays on mission” by collecting data
measuring 50 aspects of the university’s mission. These include
one-year retention rates, graduation rates, academic satisfaction,
fundraising goals, research grants received, endowments, and debt.
One can imagine the incentives that went along with reaching or
failing to reach targets for these indicators. The result of all this data
tracking is “more efficiency,” staff and faculty “working smarter”,
greater accountability, and helping the university stay “on mission.”1
Alain Supiot’s engaging, ambitious and sweeping book helps us
understand how we arrived at a place where we valorize numbers
and treat universities (and most organizations) like businesses.
In a wonderful book that merits careful scrutiny, Supiot argues that
we have lived through a profound transformation in work, law, the
state and economic life. He characterizes this shift as one from
governing by law to governance by numbers. Supiot sees this as
a global institutional crisis, one that leaves workers profoundly
alienated from work, politics, and each other. Just what does this
shift entail? One major change is that the notion of government is
replaced by “the terminology of management” [29]. Workers become
human capital. Justice is supplanted by efficiency. Rules give way to
objectives. Unions become social partners. Under the liberal regime,
law was a prerequisite for the market but retained some autonomy
from it; it was not purely an instrument of the market, as it is now.
And, globally, firms are now free to pit nations against each another in
their search for the most lenient fiscal, labor and environmental laws.
Where government is the subordination of individuals to the rule of
law, governance by numbers relies on the programming of individuals
to continually respond to information and quantified objectives. This

shift to a cybernetic view of work entails “mutually adjusting
calculations of individual utility.”
Central to Supiot’s method is “treating the law as a cultural fact.” By
this he means situating law in its historical and material context, and
making judicious use of comparison. He characterizes law according to
its aesthetic and poetic dimensions. These are the imaginary metaphors
that we use to capture the predominant normativity of an era, to
conceptualize law and society, and determine how it is we recognize
ourselves in relation to it. We have variously understood rulers and
subjects as helmsmen of ships, as shepherds of flocks. However, the most
dominant metaphor, at least since the Enlightenment, has been the image
of society as a machine in which individuals are interdependent cogs.
The first part of Supiot’s book traces the development of various
aesthetic imaginaries. Under the Greeks, law was first conceived of as being
man-made rather than divine. Nomos was the Greek term for laws made by
and for citizens, where man is subordinate to impersonal law. The Roman
conception of lex which eventually came to mean text, and ius, which
originally referred to specialized secret knowledge but came to mean law as
both a set of rules to follow and a right to act, was combined in Roman law
with nomos to create a system of law that was separate from the
philosophical and political associations it had in Greece. During the Middle
Ages, the Gregorian Revolution combined Roman law with canon which
gave rise to an understanding of government in which law is not simply an
instrument of sovereign power but also a force that helps to create it where
the sovereign is subordinate to impersonal law. This conception shaped the
early sovereign states and the development of both civil law and common
law. Rule by law became the dominant aesthetic imaginary.
The image of society as a machine is associated most famously with
Hobbes. This image of machinery that is guided by elites that are
informed by science remained the dominant aesthetic until well into
the 20th century. As Supiot notes, Taylorism was the culmination of
this normative order, where a few were paid to think and many simply
followed orders. But the mechanics of work are now being driven by
images of dispassionate science and technology.
Under the neoliberal order, workers are no longer cogs in a machine
but are part of “programmable systems of interacting unity adjusting
automatically to signal inputs and feedback” [25]. As Supiot puts it,
the “physico-mechanical model of the clock, linked to the idea of the
reign of law, has been supplanted by the model of the computer. The
organization of work is no longer conceived of as a machine controlled
by the lay of weights and forces but as a programmable system of

interacting units adjusting automatically to signal inputs and feedback”
[25]. These inputs are typically the metrics and indicators that
are now routinely used to control and organize work. Quantification
has long been fundamental to the control of labor, be it piece work,
wages, or legislation about the length of the work day. What is new, for
Supiot, is that it is no longer just the body which is subordinated.
Now the mind is dominated, too.
The second part of Supiot’s book examines the consequences of
governance by numbers with an emphasis on law and employment,
considering the effects for individuals, corporations, states and global
relations. Rather than being sovereign subjects, workers are constructed
into “objective subjects” who react to signals rather than act
freely [179]. Corporations become single-minded entities, focusing
exclusively on shareholder value. Where, formerly, corporate sectors
were integrated according to a Fordist model, they are now organized
as networks of subcontractors subordinate to the contractor. Supiot’s
compelling insight is to suggest that the legal relations among these
entities are similar to a feudal system in which the prime contractor
controls considerable capital of the subcontractor who controls the
sub-subcontractors in a complex structure of obligation and
deference.
A book of such scope cannot spend much time close to the
empirical ground. Nonetheless, it would have been useful to have at
least one or two concrete examples of how metrics affect behaviour in
practical terms. One of the consequences of governance by numbers is
the instability that is generated from more fluid labor markets and
from the “autonomy” to determine the means to meet objectives. One
form of flexible work is the gig or “click” economy, where workers rely
on platforms to locate temporary jobs in transportation, housekeeping,
home repair, or programming. It is estimated that some 70 million
people have registered with on-line labor applications2
. Gig workers
are often treated as independent contractors and may not receive the
benefits (health care, health insurance, training, paid vacations) and
protections (the right to be organized) offered to employees. Supiot
rightly emphasizes that one of the consequences of flexibility is the
stress that workers experience in this form of governance, and its

implications for their mental health. He does not provide much detail
of what this feels like but others have done so. Part of this stress comes
from the “on demand” economy and the precariousness of work—the
uncertainty over wages and not knowing how many hours one can or
must work. For Valenduc and Vendramin [2016: 34]
3 gig work is
a “continuous employment relationship without continuous work”. In
some cases, the market is global and competition is fierce. As one
Nigerian working in social media advertising reported4
, “immediately
[as] you see an offer being posted. you will see 50 proposals have
been submitted.” Needless to say, this drives wages down.
Another aspect of the stress associated with governance by numbers
is the type of surveillance they achieve. Even if governance is not
the stated goal, our fascination with performance metrics of all kinds
has penetrated deeply into many spheres. Take educational rankings.
First intended as useful consumer information, in an already marketdriven
conceptualization of students, they became such visible markets
of quality that they came to penetrate higher education. As
a result, extraordinary efforts are made to manipulate the statistics and
data that comprise them. At the global level this means that
universities across the globe are constructed in a relative hierarchy.
Some countries have reorganized their universities and their missions
in order to climb the rankings. At the organizational level, rankings
are “engines of anxiety,” where efforts to improve the numbers are
relentless and backed by powerful incentives5
. Administrators feel
intensive competition with former colleagues; they are suspicious of
the numbers their peers compile; and they fear for their bonuses and
their jobs each year as the rankings are released.
Supiot’s depiction of the “withering of the state” is, I think,
overblown. If part of the neoliberal contract has been to “liquefy”
labor markets, the state has certainly reasserted itself in the policing of
its borders. As I write this, the children of refugees are separated from
their deported parents, many of whom were fleeing for their lives, and
housed in facilities that often seem like prisons. And it is exceedingly
difficult to obtain a visa to work in the US. In Great Britain, of course,
not just migrant labor but the entire economy is threatened by Brexit.

And the current trade war between the US and China, with the
imposition of thousands of tariffs, will put a damper on trade. Clearly
the state retains the muscle to disrupt the free movement of labor and
goods.
Who should read Governance by Numbers? Quantification scholars,
of course. Economists. If only. Legal scholars, political theorists, social
theorists, scholars of work and globalization, Marxists, management
scholars, and anyone concerned with the state of contemporary
politics. Supiot has written a book that should animate scholars for
many years. One of the most stirring features of his work is his
commitment to making work meaningful and workers dignified.
Saskia Brown deserves praise for a fine translation, as does The
