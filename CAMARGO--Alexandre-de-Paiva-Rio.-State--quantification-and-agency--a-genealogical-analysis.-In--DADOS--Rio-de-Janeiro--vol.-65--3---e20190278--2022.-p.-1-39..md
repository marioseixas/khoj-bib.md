State, quantification and agency: a genealogical analysis

While words always have a contingent resonance, numbers
make it possible to represent the seriousness and dimension of
an event, since it is inserted in durable forms and stable series.

Thus, for example, the quality of a highway is taken by the number
of accidents that occur on it; the legitimacy of an election arises, in
part, from the number of voters present; the influence of an expert
on public opinion corresponds to the number of interviews,
appearances in news, quotes and references in columns and
newspaper articles; the value of intellectual work is given by
academic production indicators. Something similar happens in the
cultural industry: the quality of a musical or literary work depends
on the number of copies sold; the impact of a public performance
is determined by the number of spectators or, more recently, views

that involve allocation of resources and that produce effects on
the destiny of individuals and social groups. Qualities result from
particular perceptions and negotiations of meaning in local
interactions, which is why they hardly inspire consensus on the
definition of a situation or on the need and desirability of an
intervention. For this to happen, qualities need to be converted into
quantities, which provide objectivity protocols and, in liberal
democracies, sources of discretionary power control. Quantifying
social facts makes it possible to express and make exist, in
numerical form, what could only be perceived in words before (Desrosières and Kott; 2005).

State, quantification and agency: a genealogical analysis

This brief preamble points to the centrality of quantification, especially
of public statistics, in the organization of modern society . Figures,
indicators, indices, percentages, rates and averages make up the
arsenal of proof and inference of the technical and scientific elites ,
going beyond the scope of application for which they were initially
created and becoming categories of perception of multiple and
different social actors . Presenting itself as a synonym of objectivity
and certainty, numbers and the statistical classifications mediated by
them mark out the public sphere, adhering to the judgments and
typifications that ordinary people make in different life situations
(Desrosières and Thévenot, 1988).

More than a discourse about reality, statistics is a government
technology , which makes it a privileged object for understanding
the contours assumed by the perception of a social phenomenon –
such as inequality –, and its construction as a public problem.

Advancing this reasoning, we can state that a table tabulated
according to the distribution of suicide by the racial composition of
the population differs radically from another that tabulates the relative
participation of color groups in income and average education. These
differences occur both in terms of the theoretical universe mobilized,
as well as the conception of society and public agenda in force in
each case. The same example leads us to different registers of
inequality, whether in relation to its conditions of possibility – non-existent where and

online; A celebrity's influence is directly proportional to the number of
their followers on social media. In magazines and newspapers, the
frequency with which certain themes are repeated in the politics,
economics and behavior sections, day after day, week after week,
establishes the relevant conducts for a successful life, as well as the
necessary skills to face the bad weather. and the risks of social life.

As a sociological object, statistics requires special methodological
care. We must read matrices and tables as texts, through their
translation into propositions and systems of hypotheses, expressible
in verbal language. In this sense, Otero observes that “two tables on
mortality levels tabulated according to the season of the year or
according to the socio-occupational groups of the deceased refer to
two scientific hypotheses and two very different theoretical universes:
mortality as a climatic fact or as a fact social” (2006: 47).

This reflection is inspired by the sociology of quantification (Berman and Hirschman,

2018; Camargo and Daniel, 2021; Desrosières, 2008a; Diaz-Bone and Didier, 2016;

Espeland and Stevens, 2008). This field has been forming over the last few years, driven,

in part, by the multiplication of practices of quantifying reality under neo-liberalism, which

will be approached here as a political regime for population management (Dean, 1999;

Foucault, 2009; Rose, 1999). Over the past few decades, increasing pressure to incorporate

scientific evidence into policy decisions, to extend market discipline to governmental and

non-profit organizations, and to coordinate different activities across long cultural and

geographic distances has produced a large increase in in the ways of reasoning,

evaluating, measuring and comparing with numbers (Espeland and Stevens, 2008).

Therefore, this article shares these guidelines to discuss issues such as: the role of

quantification procedures in the construction of the State and social routines; the ways of

governing the population through numbers; and the modalities of statistical criticism of

reality, in the processes of social change. To this end, it uses the contributions of Michel

Foucault and governmentality studies on

when mortality is a climatic fact – either in relation to the visual field of what can be

problematized and governed at a given moment: income inequality and job security, in the

case of tabulating mortality by occupational groups; racial inequality, in the case of the

intersection between color and education.

In the wake of this movement, the sociology of quantification seeks to analyze the

processes of production and communication of numbers, maps and graphs – as visual

representations of numerical information –, in their effects of power on society. It follows

the classic questions of sociology, relating quantification to social inequality, forms of

evaluation and coordination of action, social knowledge, conflict and criticism, the

rationalization of life and the organization of work; without failing to also approach it as an

object in itself and in its own right. This analytical perspective is interested both in the

processes of quantification in science or guided by it, as well as in the processes located

on the border between politics, administration and public life – such as the implementation

of numerical technologies, standardization procedures and bureaucratic management and

the decision-making process and the formation of collective subjects (Diaz-Bone and

Didier, 2016).

State, quantification and agency: a genealogical analysis

It is also based on the postulates of French pragmatic sociology, in
particular the concept of “equivalence conventions” and the idea of
“plurality of logics of action”, which allow us to understand the dual
nature of statistics, as an instrument of proof and as an instrument of
government . , proposed by Desrosières (1993). It then discusses the
work of this author, highlighting his typology of State forms, which
relates the ways of quantifying reality to the ways of governing the
population (Desrosières, 2008b, 2014b). Finally, it makes critical use of
this model to outline a genealogy of the levels of reflexivity mediated
and enabled by numerical devices.

Its contribution consists of (re)thinking the State and transformative
social agency based on a synthesis between the constructivist
perspective of the Anglo-Foucaultians, who relate forms of quantification
to other technologies for inducing conduct, and the approach advocated
by Desrosières , which prioritizes the science of statistics and its role
in the coordination of social life. At the same time, it offers a substantial
review of the social studies of quantification. In particular, its contributions
to the construction of the State and the determinants of agency.

Quantifying allows you to communicate and stabilize facts and meanings
across broad networks of actors and institutions. This is because
statistical devices translate the formulations of specialized knowledge,
such as social sciences, into cognitive resources mobilized by practical
consciousness in social existence. Thus, for example, the genesis of
the price index in different countries was marked by the initiative, on
the part of authorities and experts, to monitor inflation and regulate
economic behavior. Immediately, the new statistical device proved
incapable of defending social actors from rising prices – its declared
purpose. This is precisely because they were socialized into a new
culture of numbers, which allowed them to manipulate the difference
between the counting units of the erudite economy and the payment
units of the ordinary economy, anticipating their actions in view of the
loss of value of money. Given the indexation of the economy and
salaries, the feedback of statistics on actors, instead of containing it,
contributed to stimulating inflation (Neiburg, 2011).

QUANTIFY TO GOVERN AND CRITICIZE

Machine Translated by Google
Alexandre de Paiva Rio Camargo

Authors situated within the theoretical framework of governmentality
studies, such as Rose (1992, 1999), Miller (2001) and Dean (1999),
dedicated themselves to analyzing the constitutive link between the
quantification of public life and liberal government . Numbers would be
presented as an instrument for realizing the democratic promise of
aligning the exercise of public authority with the private beliefs and
values of citizens. On the one hand, numbers impose a brake on the
discretionary power of governments and experts by forcing political
choices and bureaucratic decisions to be subject to protocols that
make them appear to be products of standardized analytical
techniques. On the other hand, democratic government requires
vigilant and calculating citizens in relation to the effects of power and
the risks of their private decisions, constantly affected by opinion and
market research that displace and quantify perceptions of reality
(Rose, 1999). The growing quantification of the contemporary world
would be a phenomenon to be understood by two complementary
dimensions that characterize modern governments : mutual surveillance
and the induction of conduct through freedoms and autonomies produced and consumed by liberalism.

From the perspectives of Foucault (2008, 2009) and Latour (1988,
2000), maps, cartograms, censuses and statistics are approached as
technologies of government at a distance, because they respect the
autonomy of private spheres and suggest conduct appropriate to
particular conceptions of individual and collective well-being. In this
sense, statistics would be a liberal technology of government because
it proceeds through the delimitation of authority and the codification of
domains of society, populated by individuals who act in accordance
with certain principles of interest and outside the legitimate scope of
direct intervention, with their own economic processes and cohesion
dynamics. Statistics are seen here as a device for transferring
government activity to the surface of society; and it does so by
structuring the field of possible actions and providing actors with norms
and standards for their own judgments, aspirations and conduct (Rose, 1999: 48-49).

DADOS, Rio de Janeiro, vol.65 (3): e20190278, 2022 5-39

In this sense, some heuristic questions become sociologically
relevant to think about the relationship between quantification,
agency and social change. What can be visualized or,
conversely, what remains obscure in certain moments or
societies, when we look at devices such as censuses, maps,
graphs, tables and diagrams, which form the visual field of what
and who should be governed? How statistics produces subjects of government, of

workers and consumers to so-called risk groups? How do numbers suggest or
induce the skills expected of them?

This distinction allows us to conceive of statistics as an institutional form that
calls reality into question and paves the way for the world. The logic of risk
encompasses these two dimensions. As a technology for taming chance, it is
designed based on the calculation of probabilities, based on measurable
precision, according to relatively stabilized formats and tests. But risk also
enshrines uncertainty as a principle of knowledge and collective action. Rejects
the pretension to accuracy and control of events, introducing what is possible
into order.

In the methodological realism shared by pragmatism, the relationship between
statistical devices and the constitution of reality is always established in a
circular fashion. While the effectiveness of categorization rests on the
previously consolidated legal basis, the numerical content that statistics
confers on social entities inscribes them in a reality conceived as independent
of individual actions and political decisions (Boltanski, 2014). For this reason,
statistics would be one of the main mediators of the relationship between
reality and the world, aligning itself with the reformist critique, which takes into
account the resilience of the forms of the State in the face of the flow of events
that disturb the order.

How are individuals and populations led to identify with certain groups, in
order to become virtuous and governable?

6-39

All of these are issues sensitive to governmentality studies and the sociology
of quantification, insofar as they privilege the material, visual and spatial
dimensions of government, and which draw attention to the cartographies of
power and authority. It is assumed that the success of a government regime
depends on how actors experience themselves through the capabilities (such
as making rational decisions), qualities (such as having a job) and status (such
as being an active citizen) encouraged and favored by it ( Dean, 1999).

DADOS, Rio de Janeiro, vol.65 (3): e20190278, 2022

In an entirely different register, the sociology of criticism by Boltanski (2009)
considers the reflexivity of social actors and their ability to justify their actions
and to mobilize their sense of justice with a view to establishing the societal
bond. The distinction that the author makes between what he calls reality,
which “tends to be confused with what seems to maintain itself by its own
strength”, that is, with order, and, on the other hand, the world, the flow of
events and experiences, the possibility of which is not contained in the known
totality (Boltanski, 2009: 93).

The reformist critique can rely on statistical instruments based
on preexisting forms, mainly when comparing different domains
of reality and establishing correlations between variables. In
turn, the radical and revolutionary position emphasizes the
interdependence of the elements that make up reality, denying
the possibility of their modification without transforming the whole at once.
It is a type of criticism that finds it very difficult to resort to statistics,
since it must be based on evidence that has not been the object of
mappings and totalizations and that, therefore, are first presented
to experience as singularities and exceptions. , approaching
aesthetics and art more than social sciences (Boltanski, 2014).

We thus see that, depending on the theoretical perspective
chosen, quantification can be approached either as a technology
of government and domination , or as a source of creation of
publics and social collectives. It gives institutional form to scattered
wills, feelings and concerns and, thus, formalizes the critique that
leads to reform and emancipation. Underlying both strands –
governmentality studies and French pragmatism – is the interest
in the growing and accelerated penetration of quantification
practices in different domains of everyday life, enabling the
privatization of risks and their harmful effects on intimacy, work relationships and life management.

Consequently, social action (which always develops in a concrete
situation) is reduced to its result, as established by goals and
performance levels previously set in an indefinite and autonomous
cycle of comparative evaluations – which instill a spirit
competitiveness and a compulsion for

In fact, the production of subjectivities and freedoms that, in fact,
camouflage the capture of initiatives and singularities, has never
been as striking and comprehensive as it is today. Numbers have
never been so dominated as under the neoliberal government.
Public services are commodified and monitored by the ability to
satisfy a clientele made up of citizens, in a relationship that boils
down to efficiency and utility; emptied of the principle of
universality and protection that until then characterized the
modern nation-state. Such a change becomes possible thanks to
benchmarking, the procedure for quantifying not only the agents'
activities but also their organizational environment.

State, quantification and agency: a genealogical analysis

The new and perverse imperative of evaluating each activity by a
single metric considered appropriate constrains the actors to
report more and more to indicators, and less and less to
judgments based on acquired skills. This is what happens in a
variety of cases, such as the reduction in traffic safety due to the
number of accidents and alcohol consumption tests; or, yet, the
growing dependence of health professionals in relation to the
number of consultations – one of the criteria for career progression
and release of resources to hospitals.

If benchmarking deposes the evaluation skills of actors in
circumstances considered unique and singular, the generalization
of quantification opens up new possibilities for criticizing reality
and allows for another attitude towards public figures: that of
giving visibility to the inequalities produced by global capitalism.
Social movements have never used statistics as an instrument of
resistance as they do today. This is what the strong politicization
of racial classifications points to; the dispute over which categories
are counted in crime statistics; or pressures against economic
domination.

This framework invites us to carry out an exploratory analysis of
contemporary ways of reasoning, valuing, measuring and
comparing with numbers , and which single out the ways of
quantifying in neoliberalism when compared to other government
regimes. On the next pages, a genealogy of the forms of reflexivity
mediated and made possible by quantification devices will be
outlined , in order to (re)introduce estrangement in relation to the
increasingly quantified world in which we live, opening a new
horizon of criticism of the present. It is, therefore, a preliminary
investigation into long-term processes, which requires knowing
which levels of agency and social life were progressively
constructed as commensurable domains.

“good practices” (Bruno and Didier, 2013: 13). As Desrosières
stated , “once quantification procedures are codified and
routinized, their products are reified. They tend to become
'reality' through a ratchet effect, which is very difficult to
reverse” (2008a: 12). Constrained by benchmarking, agents are
obliged to achieve quantified objectives and to indefinitely
intensify their performance in the area defined by the indicator.

POLITICAL REGIMES AND STATISTICAL REASONING: ALAIN’S CONTRIBUTION

From the point of view of statistical work, this dual attitude is reflected in the quest to

create objects that remain, both for formal reasons – manufacturing indicators,

classifications and models of coherent and realistic representation of reality – and for
social reasons – the aspiration to legitimacy as a convention and in the constitution of
society. Taken together, these properties would respond to the effectiveness

DESROSIÈRES

9-39

One of the founders of the sociology of quantification, the Frenchman Alain Des

Rosières (1940-2013), was noted for his radically innovative approach to statistics,

always highlighting its dual dimension of “instrument of proof” and “instrument of

government”, present since his pioneering work on the socio-genesis of professional

nomenclatures1. The book already showed the tension that would run through all of

his work, between, on the one hand, an internalist approach to the procedures of

scientific resource to numbers and, on the other, the destabilization of numerical proof
through the denunciation of its construction by the dominant groups (Desrosières and
Thévenot, 1988). From then on, his reflections were profoundly marked by the idea of
the multiplicity of equivalence conventions and the plurality of the logics of action, one
of the main postulates of the economy of conventions (Boltanski and Thévenot, 1991;
Thévenot, 1986). Desrosières emphasized that all quantification is necessarily preceded
by a convention – the categorization of a phenomenon precedes its measurement –,
which implies that statistics must be conceived simultaneously as conventional and real.

This conception appears formulated for the first time in his book La politique des grands

nombres (1993), in which the author carries out a sociological history of statistical

reason, whose intelligibility resides in the permanent oscillation between its two opposite

and complementary poles: numerical proof, which serves to describe reality and, as

such, an indisputable reference that precedes debates; and State activity, which serves

to prescribe and act on that same reality and, as such, is the target of denunciation and

deconstruction of the pyramid of equivalences that sustain social distinction. These are,

therefore, two registers of language that result in two attitudes towards reality that must

also be taken into account in sociological analysis: one realistic (objectivist) and the

other relativist (constructivist).

State, quantification and agency: a genealogical analysis

This reflection clearly comes close to the Foucaultian perspective
on government regimes, especially with regard to the circularity
between the field of knowledge (and numbers) and the modalities
of public intervention. Although Desrosières only became aware of
Foucault's lectures decades after the philosopher's death - with the
late publication of his courses at the Collège de France it is possible
to perceive the same underlying theoretical concern: what is the
relationship between statistical instruments and the forms of
subjectivation and induction of social agency?

–,

In L´État, le Marché et les Statistiques2 (2008b), Desrosières conceives
the concept of “political regimes of statistics”, applying the epistemological
framework developed in La politique des grands nombres as a theoretical
solution for a more precise articulation between the poles of proof and
the government. The text proposes to historicize public action by linking
different types of State, different ways of governing the population and
configurations of statistical practices.
On the one hand, it is understood that the State does not have a single
form and that its actions cannot be interpreted from the same rationality
of intervention. On the other hand, the modalities of public action are
related to the material and cognitive instruments historically constructed
by the State and which enable interventions.

There are important differences, however. As Diaz-Bone and Didier
(2016) observed , Foucault linked statistics in general to neoliberal
governmentality, leaving aside the variations between statistical
techniques that correspond to different modalities of criticizing reality –
precisely what interested Desrosières. Different statistical methods have
different effects on population management, hence the importance of a
research program aimed at demonstrating the associations between
ways of quantifying and ways of governing.

(2008) offers a tentative answer, identifying five ideal types of State
forms based on their relationship with the economy and

of statistics as a basis for the societal bond: “For these objects
(categories, concepts, measures) to be permanent, they must be based
on conventions, which must be unquestionable for life to follow its course
and, however, debatable for that life can change course” (Desrosières,
1993: 398).

economic conduct. In this way, census technologies and population and
production statistics would adjust to the needs of the “Engineer State”;
price statistics based on classical economic theory accompany the
“Liberal State”; labor statistics , budget surveys of working families,
probability calculation techniques for determining social insurance are
the basis of the political rationality of the Providential State; national
accounting, research on consumption and employment and econometric
techniques respond to the needs of the “Keynesian State ”. Following
the crisis of the two previous and intertwined models, the “Neoliberal
State” puts an end to forecasting and planning techniques based on
macroeconomic knowledge. Instead, it takes advantage of the
generalization of benchmarking techniques that rest on the principle of
rational anticipations and the promotion of competition between actors.
And they do so according to measurable goals and objectives , and no
longer according to the concrete relationships in which they take part
(Armatte, 2014: 21).

Although quite fruitful in the possibilities of analysis it reveals, the
proposed approach, like most models of a logical nature, faces the
difficulty of articulating abstract forms and concrete and situated historical
regimes. This is the case of the “Engineer State”, which the author
defines as strongly hierarchical and rationally organized , occupying the
space of the private sector in order to plan long-term structural
transformations through the production of demographic statistics and
exchange tables between industrial sectors. trials (Desrosières, 2008b:
41-44). The problem with this definition is that it remains historically too
fluid, encompassing both Colbertism in absolutist France and the Soviet
planning regime – in which statistics appears fully identified with the
higher levels of bureaucracy and economic dirigisme, in its original
meaning of “ state science”.

We will weave a dialogue between the approach suggested by
Desrosières and the reflections of Foucault and governmentality studies
on biopolitics and the conditions of minimum government that
characterize liberalism (Fou Cault, 2009). That is, the view of statistics
understood as a technology of liberal government, insofar as it delimits authority through

codification of society's domains and respect for the autonomy of the private
sphere, inducing appropriate conduct to particular conceptions of individual and
collective well-being. The objective is to try to overcome typological limitations
through a genealogical analysis, emphasizing the singularity of the events that
sometimes sustain, sometimes discontinue government regimes. This option will
allow us to examine the levels of social life progressively constructed as domains
of commensuration and the modalities of criticism revealed by each of the
configurations proposed by Desrosières3 .

In the Liberal State, the economic government delimits the uses of statistics as
a public regulator, ensuring that economic decisions are not supported by the will
or authority of the rulers,

12-39

QUANTIFICATION IN THE LIBERAL STATE

DADOS, Rio de Janeiro, vol.65 (3): e20190278, 2022

In the Liberal State, the governmental reason turns to the configuration of the
market as a source of veridiction of economic processes and self-limitation of
political power. The market, as a naturalized stage of action, poses a limitation
to the government every time it rehearses unwanted interventions, as unnatural,
in the order of things and interests (Foucault, 2009: 44). It is in the self-regulated
space of the market that economics seeks the essence of homo economicus –
a form of subject that is supposed to be inscribed in nature and, therefore, in
historical development.

The ethical subject of government, guided by market transparency, must be
calculating and prudent with regard to the effects of its choices and decisions, in
addition to having a practical awareness of economic operations that promote its
interests. In this framework, individuals are led to (re)cognize the dangers that
constitute social life, threatening the freedoms that the government needs to
produce the responsible subject and, thus, transfer governmental activity to the
surface of society. It is up to the Liberal State to guarantee security mechanisms
and encourage an education on danger, enabling individuals to experience it on
a daily basis: from police literature to journalistic interest in crime; from hygiene
campaigns to the framing of sexuality as a source of degeneration of the
individual, nation and race. From the middle of the 19th century, “danger will
progressively become the psychological and cultural correlate of
liberalism” (Foucault, 2009: 90-91).

but in the regularities that constitute the economy and society. Statistics, alongside the

unification of weights and measures and the harmonization of the timetable system,

originates an information regime based on quantification, allowing sequences of activities

to be synchronized in time and space (Camargo, 2016: 85).

With regard to the production of a capitalist economic ethos, efforts to standardize

international trade were important, aimed at regulating customs and exchange rates to

enable the management of national currencies. It was not by chance that the International

Statistical Congresses, created in 1853, were driven by the conviction that international

trade statistics would undermine protectionism and state interventions in the market,

revealing that “liberalism was the underlying tendency of internationalism this tistic”4

(Gagnon, 2000: 193). From the end of the 19th century, with the need to regulate industrial

concentration and establish a parameter for antitrust legislation, economic statistics

became reflective, capturing the effects of price changes on the behavior of sellers and

buyers (Desrosières, 2008b: 46 ).

13-39

Thus, statistical practices must be understood from the perspective of the market as a

principle of social cohesion and self-limitation of the State, referring to the awareness of

danger and the economic agency of the ethical subject of liberalism.

In the first case, the criminal, demographic and health statistics of urban interventions

stand out, which space crime, poverty and disease as an eminent risk of social life. Taken

together, these statistics revealed the measure of crime, insanity, prostitution, vagrancy,

and suicide. Phenomena that were previously considered residual and treated in the

voluntaristic terms of virtue and vice and that now became categories of deviation to be
known and measured because they represent a threat to the unity of society (Hacking,

1982). Alongside detective novels, which explored the everyday life of criminality, the serial

visualization of a varied grid of phenomena, previously inaccessible to comparison, was

fundamental in shaping the eminently liberal notion of security. An inseparable notion of

the internalization of violence, which resulted from the reduction of contrasts and emotional

excitement to which individuals were subject before the pacification of social spaces (Elias,

1993).

State, quantification and agency: a genealogical analysis

QUANTIFICATION IN THE PROVIDENTIAL STATE

Social insurance was the technology of government, generated in response
to the crisis caused by the tension between capital and work, which
fermented the revolutionary environment of the second half of the 19th
century. It constituted the base from which the elements of the State would be built.

14-39 DADOS, Rio de Janeiro, vol.65 (3): e20190278, 2022

Courts, reformatories, schools, clinics, kindergartens and maternity
hospitals are among the new institutions that link the fiscal and
bureaucratic capacities of the State to the government of the social.
Similarly, devices such as social insurance, accidents at work, the
school hygiene booklet and unemployment and family budget statistics
will make it possible to link the aspirations of authorities to the daily lives of individuals.

The Welfare State corresponds to the rearticulation of the political
rationality of liberalism in the face of the invention of the social. It seeks
to promote the socialization of the risks produced by the division of
labor through the organization of care and employment promotion
devices . Rose and Miller (1992) propose that the “social” be
understood as terrain brought into existence by the government itself;
a space of unprecedented and specific problems, the target of
technologies and programs aimed at guaranteeing social and economic
objectives: the reversal of the decline in the birth rate; the control of
delinquency and antisocial behavior; education and family socialization;
the social consequences of unhealthy conditions and the advantages
provided by a healthy population; the integration of citizens into the
moral community of the civitas.

The invention of the social as a register of society would expand the
possibilities of action at a distance, making the State the fundamental
vector of coordination of human activities and responsible for preventing
the evils produced by the very organization of society: accidents,
natural disabilities, hereditary and contagious diseases. , nail down.
Far from violating the principle of minimal government, State intervention
will be justified by the notion of debt to those exposed to the disastrous
consequences of the division of labor, following the canon of liberal
utilitarianism: repairing damages and remedying evils, in order to
increase the chances successful collective actions of each one, through
their own merits (Camargo, 2016). It is not a denial, but an unfolding of
the political rationality of liberalism that reconfigures the relations
between State, quantification and social agency.

-unemployment and social assistance. Involving salaried workers'
unions , research on the budget of working families and on consumer
goods was established by investing social relations in statistical forms
capable of providing a language for the expression of claims and
negotiations resulting from class conflicts (Desrosières, 2014a: 55).

In this framework, statistical practices will be redirected towards the
production of new spaces and subjects of government, focusing on
the indexation of wages, the extent of unemployment and the cost of
living. It is worth highlighting here the statistical construction of the
phenomenon of unemployment and the figure of the unemployed
person. If during most of the 19th century political economists saw
unemployment as a temporary phenomenon, due to the impossibility
of balancing supply and demand, the 1880s and 1890s witnessed the
consecration of the term “unemployed” as a synonym for a person
who does not work. against your will. Introduced by Alfred Mashall,
“unemployment” was soon defined as “the total amount of human
labor power not employed in the production of social wealth” (Hobson
apud Alberti, 2011: 2). With this precise meaning, “unemployed” has
become a recurrent category in population censuses and in periodic
surveys , another novelty inaugurated by the national departments of labor.

The first censuses in which the unemployed appear were those of the
USA (1880), Germany (1895), France (1896) and Italy (1901). Two
aspects must be highlighted. First: it was these surveys, which brought
the definition of unemployment as an involuntary condition, which
allowed sewing for the first time the distinction between economically
active and inactive population, allocating the unemployed as part of
the first group. Second: the compilation of regular data on the subject
involved, also in an unprecedented way, the cooperation between
government agencies and workers' unions , which passed on the
records of their members' activities in order to receive unemployment
benefits and other corresponding benefits. , equally recent (Camargo,
2016: 80).

Therefore, alongside the development of a whole machinery for
personnel management and well-being provision, such as new
health facilities, recreation spaces and support for savings and
loans, statistics was one of the fundamental technologies of
transformation. mation of the workplace in a social domain.
Together, the new resources shifted political conflicts from the
workplace, transforming it into a space for risk distribution and
accident prevention (Rose, 1999: 126). As Donzelot (1994:
121-177) put it well , one of the most important effects of
insurance was the de-dramatization of social conflicts, by
eliminating the problem of assigning responsibility for the origins
of public ills and reducing the impasse to a matter of technical
choice. , among different parameters, to optimize jobs, wages and investments.

From the point of view of the economy and economic agency,
new indicators are invented, according to a principle of joint
optimization of regulatory strategies, making the economy compatible with

binding to concrete legal effects (benefits and penalties); and the
deepening of interdependence through the expansion of the
security/freedom game for work as the government's new visual
field. In this way, the solidity and uses of statistical information
are increased through the translation of interests and the
organization of action in a network, involving bosses, employees,
their respective unions, government agencies, statistical
bureaucracy and social analysts, among others (Camargo, 2016: 81).

The Keynesian State differs from the Providential State by the
industrial scale of the social management mechanisms and by
the ability to link a wide variety of local points to a center of
government and calculation, which expands the possibilities of
population monitoring. Employment agencies, rehabilitation
clinics, health posts, courts, schools, asylums and factories
become institutional spaces for identifying men, women and
children as pathological individuals. If before these spaces were
limited to prescribing reform measures, now they track risk
groups benefiting from protection policies, mobilizing social
workers and other specialists in a visible network (and subject to
normalizing intervention) supported by a bureaucracy of pedagogy and care . (Rose, 1999: 131-133).

This phenomenon is best symbolized by the emergence of national accounting.

Distinguishing themselves from the old estimates of countries' revenue, characteristic of

the Liberal State, national accounts invest the national space in the form of a large

company, calculating different variations in size and visualizing human activities as a flow

of services and goods – innovation made possible by introduction of sample research5 .

Secondly, although sample surveys have the census as their primary source of information,

they show a political-cognitive revolution in the quantification of reality. The metrological

realism of the census is based on the vision of the national territory as an organic totality

and on the recognition of its internal division, in census districts and demographic regions.

All subunit counts in this set refer to the national average, which defines what is accidental

and/or exceptional. Random sampling, on the other hand, makes the part autonomous in

relation to the whole as it deterritorializes the observation conditions of economic and

social relations. While the census is marked by the exhaustiveness and accuracy of the

as a whole articulated in macroeconomic flows, capable of being measured and

reconnected in theoretically coherent and exhaustive accounting tables (Desrosières,

2008b: 50).

The adoption of sampling in statistical research was much more than a mere technical

innovation. Firstly, by covering a much more restricted universe of people and situations,

representative sampling makes it possible to reduce the high costs of an exhaustive survey

with a territorial and synchronic basis (such as the census) in addition to making its results

available much more quickly. Dependence on the census as the only source of information

on population movements gives way to continuous and monthly surveys of inflation (price

index), unemployment (monthly job survey), consumption (household budget), industrial

growth (input matrix). -product) and social development (GDP per capita), which enable

the constant monitoring of flows according to the company's rationale and on a national

scale.

According to Desrosières (1988: 93-112), the policy of measurable
precision, which is the basis of sampling, only emerges when local
techniques for managing public problems, typical of previous
regimes , give way to the management of a State that is presents
itself as the center that subordinates and hierarchizes the peripheries of power.

The effects of the sampling revolution on the performativity of
numbers and the conditions of reflexivity will be felt at different
levels. On the one hand, research that reveals the inequality of
mobility between socio-professional categories begins to guide the
career choices and advancement strategies of social actors. On the
other hand, inflation and cost of living indicators become an
obligatory point of reference for families' consumption options, for
union pressure for wage indexation and for the construction of the
economic crisis as a social fact.

correspondence, an approximate truth is pursued in favor of the
level of significance that the data can impart to the pragmatic action
of the State and economic actors.

Previously, economic agents relied on a general and diffuse
knowledge of the conditions in which they operated to predict
scenarios and anticipate situations. Now, their actions are constantly
reoriented by a varied repertoire of fluctuating information about
investment opportunities and the availability of resources that
guarantee risk collectivization policies – such as “full employment”,
social insurance, universal education and care for the elderly,
children, the disabled and the alienated.

The planned and planning State figures here as the main guarantor
of individual freedom against the pathologies and risks that surround
social life. Neoliberal criticism disqualifies this association between
freedom and regulation, accusing joint responsibility of producing a
culture of dependence that inhibits the individual's ability to undertake
and optimize their well-being and quality of life.
Through the new social form of “community” – an intermediary
between the individual and society –, subjects will be produced by

Therefore, the responsibility of individuals, families and
communities increases , as risk minimization becomes an aspect
of the choices they make as consumers, clients and service users.
In the 19th century, prudence was limited to procreation,
industrious behavior, sobriety and domestic frugality . In neoliberal
governmentality, the virtuous and calculating subject needs to
monitor the risks related to the most different domains of social
life: physical and mental health, sexual life, chemical and emotional
dependence, unemployment, helplessness in old age, school
performance , professional failure, low self-esteem, exposure to
crime, among others (Dean, 1999).

From guarantor of public life and manager of the risks that
constitute it, the State becomes a facilitator of the virtues that
individuals must possess as active citizens, capable of making
choices to satisfy their interests and live prudently. The action of
public authorities aims to empower subjects through techniques
to promote autonomy, such as examination of conscience, concern
for self-esteem, alternative pedagogy and the rhetoric of voice and
direct representation, which pass to reconfigure the role of statecertified
institutions. Schools, hospitals, organizations

The Neoliberal State is characterized by the generalization of the
economic form of the market to society as a whole, functioning as
a principle of intelligibility of social relations and individual
behaviors (Foucault, 2009). The formalization of society, based
on the company model, becomes an instrument that shapes
administration by providing a new foundation for power that
encompasses and goes beyond the old political and legal criticism
of “excessive government”. This is because the market ceases to
constitute the principle of self-limitation of the government, as
occurred in classical liberalism, to become a kind of court through
which non-economic behaviors – such as crime, judicial decisions,
pathologies social and family life – are now read through the analytical key of economics.

tions, employment agencies and trade associations are transformed into
partners in the government enterprise of welfare achievement (Rose, 1999:
147).

Public numbers become a relevant item of consumption and agencies that
produce official data are redefined as providers of services determined by the
needs of their users.
They become companies that offer products in a market made up of customers
who are sensitive to price and quality. There is pressure for the abandonment
of research that does not meet consumer demand for information, judged to
be expensive and inefficient due to the budgetary restriction policy. Statistical
work is framed by the principles of marketing and total quality (which impose a
calendar of pre-fixed dates for the publication of research) and good practice
manuals for its validation: accessibility, transparency, independence,
objectivity and secrecy are some of the demands that statisticians must face
in the face of the dismemberment of the State and the retreat of trust in
professional authority (Beaud and Prévost, 2010).

This is about displacing the authority of experts, criticized for promoting
exclusions and delegitimizing local forms of knowledge, infantilizing patients,
students, unemployed people, retirees and all sorts of people assisted by the
bureaucracy of pedagogy and care.

The conversion of public goods into services offered to clientele not only
reconfigures the State but also changes the forms of subjectivation. Subjection
becomes a condition of freedom, as suggested by the example of the
unemployed person, who only receives assistance if they commit to looking
for work and matching the profile desired by companies. The support and
guidance received by the consumer of employment agency services precedes
and induces the freedom to be exercised by the worker.

Experts will be trained and evaluated for their ability to observe the needs of
their audiences and to respect the right to the body and the principle of selfdetermination,
which preside over the need to explain protocols and share the
risks involved in each position taken ( Rose and Miller, 1992).

The cooling of bureaucratic and professional domination reflects the
dismemberment of the State into multiple service provision agencies, whose
quality must be achieved through the same business management practices,
and constantly guided by the needs of its consumers. The case of statistical
institutions is emblematic.

Benchmarking is a government technology, a specific art for conducting social

organizations. According to Bruno and Didier (2013: 18), it is characterized by a sequence

of a certain number of pre-identified actors and activities; 2) setting a quantified objective

establishes norms, goals, quality control, performance indicators and standards of good

actors and agencies (Dean, 1999: 165).

DADOS, Rio de Janeiro, vol.65 (3): e20190278, 2022

This last point constitutes the main difference between previous quantification practices

and those of neoliberal governmentality.

21-39

While the statistics of the Keynesian State gave rise to the fight against unemployment

and the defense of families' purchasing power, new measurement instruments were

disseminated by the public administration to govern their own employees and the

relationships they maintain with their users-clients - citizens, taxpayers, retirees and

students. Feedback on the agency is significantly expanded with benchmarking, that is,

the evaluation and classification according to goals and performance levels, which is made

possible by the dissemination of the theory of rational anticipations and the adoption of

mechanisms to encourage conduct.

According to this theory, public policies tend to fail when actors integrate the anticipated

effects of public decisions into their cognitive schemes. An understanding that underlies

the decomposition of the State into several management centers, managed like companies,

targets of the same incitement devices for objectives that guide other economic actors.

Econometric models allow us to separate the expected effects of policies and isolate them

from the results achieved, which are improved by the pressure of fiscal stimuli and codes

of good practice (Desrosières, 2014b).

State, quantification and agency: a genealogical analysis

This is a fundamental difference between the indicators produced by
INSEE or IBGE, on the situation or the price index, and the indicators
that the actors produce about themselves for the purpose of optimizing
management. In the first case, the numbers result from the observation
of an external reality; in the second, a gaze directed at oneself in a
continuous and self-referential manner. This reveals the essential
tension of the new system, which depends on trusting those who are
in a position to produce , because they know, and, at the same time,
distrusting them, due to the permanent threat of fraud and lies (Bruno and Didier, 2013).

From an organizational point of view, fraud and irregularities become
tolerable as long as they do not cost more than the suppression of the
surveillance apparatus saves. The evaluators' prerogative to evaluate
themselves is presented as an advantage, an anti- bureaucratic
weapon, as employees gain a significant margin of initiative, supposedly
freeing themselves from the constraints of hierarchy and the formalism
of regulations. Similarly, by being based on voluntary adherence and
by remunerating work based on results – and not by hours worked –,
the new regime would bring the additional advantage of valuing merit
and creative capacity, when, in fact, agents are subjected to a more
perverse and subtle domination than the old interference of the
hierarchical superior, the law and the sovereign power.

In this new regime of public quantification, the indicators depend
on the agents themselves to quantify and monitor their activities.
After all, who can know how many articles a researcher has
published in a given year, other than himself? Who can know
how many interventions a police patrol carries out in a day,
other than the police themselves? How many patients were seen
in a shift, if not the doctors on duty? The appraised who become
their own appraisers, accounting and reporting the data that concern them.

This is because, unlike public statistics, benchmarking is not
intended to reflect and transform external reality, but to modify
the behavior of the actors themselves based on the freedoms
that it produces and consumes. On the one hand, being public,
the measures of quantified activities constrain those responsible
to make efforts to avoid the humiliation of bad results. On the other hand, each

“subjects individuals to an indefinite discipline, designed to guide
their engagement in action and govern what is most personal:
their initiatives” (idem: 120).

In each case, the modalities of judgment and statistical formalization
of these problems, the distribution of responsibilities between the
actors, the means of a posteriori evaluation of public policies and their
transformation depending on this evaluation are simultaneously
elaborated and negotiated (Desrosières , 2008b).

The new public quantification regime multiplies the places and
domains of production and use of quantified information, always based
on the performance of state initiatives and the co-responsibility of
individual actors: environment, bioethics, child abuse, drug addiction,
disease prevention sexually transmitted diseases, protection of cultural
minorities, gender equality, safety of domestic and industrial equipment,
quality standards for consumer goods.

The action to be taken is judged in terms of failure to be stigmatized
or success to be rewarded, which has the effect of deconsolidating
public agents from society as a whole and deflating the perception of
their social function (Bruno and Didier, 2013). By resorting to the
incessant quantification of all activities, according to the imperatives
of “ total quality” and “international competitiveness”, benchmarking

A circularity is created between the efficiency of public action and the
performances of individual actors, who increasingly rely on
benchmarking and indicators and less and less on judgment based on
acquired skills, to maintain and expand their position in the division. of
work. The quantification of the ends and means of action, both for
professionals and consumers, produces a new reference system in
which the same indicators and classifications provide equivalence to
measure different quantities. Take the case of alcohol consumption
tests while driving, used by police officers and traffic agents as an
indicator of their performance. While the former tend to evaluate their
efficiency by increasing this figure, the latter justify their performance
by decreasing it (Desrosières, 2014b).

These are definitions of opposite situations, which result from the
framing of agents by measurable objectives established by their
respective institutions – police and municipal guard. Individuals are
led to relate to phantasmagoric goals instead of the concrete situations
in which they take part. In front of a painting

of existential insecurity and psychological damage caused by continuous
responsibility and self-surveillance, they try to maximize their opportunities for
gain, often to the detriment of the collective interest – paradoxically sacrificed
by the extreme individualization of working conditions promoted by
benchmarking.

Another characteristic phenomenon of the counting practices of the neoliberal
government mentality is the change in the status of the subjective and its
statistical treatment. Once the feedback of indicators is no longer the
unforeseen effect of quantification techniques to become the purpose of
political rationality anchored in benchmarking, measuring perception emerges
as a possibility. Categories of origin, ethnicity, race and identity, previously
considered “too subjective”, become privileged variables in surveys and
research. The admission of self-declaration and belonging as a sufficient
basis for counting indigenous and Afro-descendant populations demonstrates
a break with the objectivist conceptions of metrological realism prevailing
since the 19th century. The constructed character of identity is accepted to
mitigate external factors that affect the performance of minority groups.

The measurement of subjective perception as the basis for moral recognition
and the material existence of social groups changes the struggle for identity
management. While social movements insist on counting as a way of resisting
and making themselves exist, neoconservative sectors

There are numerous examples in which agents seek to deceive with the rule.
In the police, when the intention is to “make numbers”, small drug dealers with
known addresses are approached. This allows police officers to count both
drug seizures and the arrest of suspects and, in this way, meet their weekly
target, taking advantage of the fact that the operation's metrics do not
distinguish the volume of seizures, nor the hierarchy of trafficking. In the same
vein, we have the procedure of registering a “verified fact” (e.g. car theft) in a
city, such as Rio de Janeiro, with the suspect located in another city, such as
São Paulo. In this case, the São Paulo police chief can count the interrogation
as a “clarified fact” in the city, while Rio de Janeiro gains a “verified fact”.
Conversely, if the level of crime is high, testifying against police performance,
the police chief may refuse to make a police report, deterring the victim from
his intention to file a complaint (Bruno and Didier, 2013).

These are mobilizations led by lay people, specialists, NGOs and local and

municipal administration bodies in reaction to evaluation criteria that they perceive

as discriminatory. In other cases, statactivisme is not against indicators, but

consists of quantifying original data to make a problem visible and relevant:

workers denounce the precariousness of their jobs using numbers to defend their

rights; Pro-immigration activists estimate the cost of the deportation policy to show

the price society pays for it. In general, the use of statistics is part of the contention

repertoire and is an important resource for contemporary mobilizations (Bruno,

The advance in quantification of individuals' intimate lives has produced an attitude of

distrust in relation to numbers, especially visible in the way in which the results of censuses

and statistical surveys have been received, being systematically discredited in countries

with neoconservative and neopopulist governments, something unthinkable a long time

ago. a decade or two ago. On the one hand, this skepticism was inflated on the right, by
the advent of “post-truth” and the crisis of confidence in science, today under attack by
irrationalists and reactionaries. On the other hand, there is a growing movement on the
left of those who criticize the dehumanizing coldness of statistics and reject it in principle
and en bloc, as if quantification were always and necessarily in favor of the State and
capital.

This is a merely reactive attitude towards “quantomania”, which, paradoxically, ends up

reinforcing the fetish for numbers.

To quantify is to produce knowledge and gather power. It can therefore be a valuable

means of overcoming sectoral criticism and restoring the dimension of the public and the

universal, eroded by benchmarking. Statactivisme, a neologism proposed by Bruno, Didier

and Prévieux (2014) and inspired by the sociology of criticism by Boltanski (2009), is a

descriptive concept used to qualify the different experiences that aim to reappropriate the

emancipatory power of statistics. Although the tradition of using statistics to guarantee

demands for rights is long, some ways of intervening with numbers are quite recent,

specifically those aimed at attacking the methods of domination characteristic of neoliberal

governmentality:

Finally, we find the statistical construction of collective subjects,
endowed with their own interests and will. More than individually
escaping the authority of benchmarking, as at the first level, or
denouncing the lies hidden in false promises of protection, as at
the second level, it seeks to use statistics to redefine objectives
pursued by institutions, with emancipatory purposes.

26-39 DADOS, Rio de Janeiro, vol.65 (3): e20190278, 2022

Bruno, Didier and Prévieux (2014) identify three ways of fighting
with numbers. The first level consists of deceiving the rule, as we
saw previously in the case of police officers. This is what happens
when actors appropriate the data production rules that serve selfassessment
to, more or less openly, adapt them to their own
interests. Here we have a makeup of the numbers, as seen when
an employee of a company uses time or work instruments for
activities outside their function. However, as can be seen, the bias
allows maximizing the autonomy of agents against the domination
they face; however, it does not engender the conditions for its
critique and reform.

The second level, on the other hand, requires a deliberately critical
and assertive positioning, which involves a certain degree of
knowledge of the data production chain and an association of
interests between different actors. It involves accessing a debate
or a public platform to accuse a particular institution of quantifying
the activities of its employees in order to misrepresent, rather than
achieve, the goals it is supposed to pursue. Publicity is fundamental
here, be it a documentary film or a sociological research, which
reveal, for example, how the decrease in criminal statistics does
not correspond to the greater efficiency of the security apparatus,
which could be the result of manipulations in the codifications
carried out by the state agencies (Silverman, 2014).

Such is the case of the groups that gather around the transformation
of the strictly economic concept of Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
in order to include biodiversity, domestic work and other forms of
wealth, and, thus, promote justice and the promise of social equity.

When social experiences no longer fit into the available formats, we
witness a political and cognitive effort to build a new category
compatible with the aspirations of a social group. To gain recognition,
groups have an interest in institutionalizing themselves statistically.
Tasset (2014) investigated two recent attempts of this type. First, the
effort of some French social scientists to introduce the category
“precarious intellectuals”, claiming that the established occupational
nomenclatures were forged in the old social protection system, now in
crisis. This would no longer be able to explain the impact of
precariousness on the group of cultural professionals, which, for them,
brings together researchers, professors , museum guides, librarians,
editors, journalists; all young and graduated, without salary stability,
whose moral greatness would be threatened by an increasingly
utilitarian way of life. In addition to individual situations and competences,
the category would be justified against a new standard of social
functioning that devalues and makes intellectual work easier in general.

In the opposite direction to this strategy, there are American
economists , who aggregate young people with similar occupations,
equally educated and professionally unstable, under the category
“creative class”. What the French denounce as alienating and ambiguous
is valued here as a permanent disposition for innovation. The social
heterogeneity of cultural professions makes it possible to illustrate, at
the same time, two opposing theses : on the one hand, a precariat
organized as a political subject that bases its unity on civic legitimacy;
on the other, a group of flexible and enterprising professionals, always
willing to exercise their freedom in the labor market, seeing themselves
as the vanguard of cognitive capitalism. In both cases, French social
scientists and American economists seek to provide consistency to the
social aggregates that they help to establish by quantifying them (Tasset, 2014).

In addition to benchmarking, official statistics and alternative
counts carried out by social groups – the last two mobilized by

Algorithmic quantification is found in the application of mathematical models to
population management. In this case, the massive circulation of microdata
allows access to territories, groups, institutions, markets and countries in
fractions of seconds. An automated statistical knowledge emerges from the
correlations of previously selected, non-hierarchical and highly heterogeneous
information, reducing human intervention and dispensing with hypotheses and
conventions about the social world (Rouvroy, 2014). Apparently without any
mediation, the objectivity and veracity of the results obtained seem to reach
their maximum degree, since it is assumed that their hypotheses are the data
in circulation. As a result, reality takes on the appearance of a public sphere.

diet that cause frequent discomfort), and cultivating habits (such as setting
goals that involve physical exertion).

The main issue posed by algorithmic operations is the generation of control
mechanisms without the need for support in speeches and ideologies. A truth
is produced, detached from social conventions, which cannot be the object of
debates or disagreements except in closed and targeted bubbles. A particularly

the struggle for emancipation? On the one hand, performance
indicators demonstrate the assessment and judgment skills of actors

incommensurable . On the other hand, statistical activism demands

perverse when considering policy implementation and monitoring .
This is the case of models that predict the chances of criminal
recidivism – which use secret methods based on factors such as
race, class, origin and other social cleavages. As a study by O'Neil
(2017) showed, one of these models predicts that a prisoner from a
poor, highly policed neighborhood is more likely to be incarcerated
again, which would justify his confinement for longer. Upon leaving
prison and returning to his neighborhood, the chance of reoffending
would increase, given the extended period spent in the prison
environment. In other words, getting out of prison confirms the
prediction that offenders in this neighborhood will reoffend. The
effectiveness of such a model lies in its recursive effects on reality,
which accentuate the distortions of criminal justice rather than correcting them.

Thus, big data is characterized by statistical automation in relation to
conventions, escaping the disputes of a public sphere that becomes
opaque and guiding countless decisions by governments and
companies that empty the channels of democratic deliberation. It
shares with bench marking the political rationality that rests on the
collection, aggregation and decentralized analysis of data, in order to
model, anticipate and affect behaviors. This is the main characteristic
of quantification in neoliberalism, which, unlike previous government
regimes, promotes interaction between social agents and autonomous
technologies to make them subjects of their own observation and
classification: monitors of their sociability.

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

Between one pole and the other we find the practices of selfquantification

case and use, can both increase control and generate resources that

and the algorithm promise to encourage; but which, by subjecting
them to an undefined discipline of comparative evaluation, end up, on
the contrary , capturing and emptying.

The counter-hegemonic categorization and numerical counterdiscourse
promote a struggle that, as Foucault (2000) suggested,
passes less and less through the mediation of intellectuals and
spokespersons of conscience, opening space for polyphonic multiplicity
and networked action. which is no longer run by parties, unions and corporations.

In turn, statistical activism makes it possible to question reality and
pave the way for other becomings, under the condition that we do not
reject the emancipatory power of quantification in favor of an alleged
superiority of qualities and singularities over quantities. Against the
iron cage of economic reason, an “another number” is the entrance to
“another world” (Didier and Tasset, 2013: 138). The statistical
construction of new collective subjects and the reactions against
institutions accused of quantifying the activities of their employees to
misrepresent the objectives they were supposed to pursue constitute
unprecedented forms of democratization of sovereignty.

Hegemonic and exclusionary forms of quantification force social
scientists to sophisticate their view of numbers as the privileged link
between the State, science and public life. After all, the monopolization
of data as resources about things and people is not only a growing
problem for citizens, but also a threat to the infrastructure of social
knowledge. Rather than vested and private interests, publicly debated
scientific standards should provide the basis of counts, measures,
and categories that allow for valuing and coordinating issues of
common interest. This is perhaps the most urgent and neglected way
of democratizing sovereignty at present: qualifying, through political
experience and public deliberation, the freedoms and autonomies that
benchmarking

improve the quality of life. As Desrosières warned, these are
apparently distant and irreconcilable attitudes, which can be
brought closer together by a strategy of analyzing the relationships
between the ways of thinking about society, the ways of acting
on it and the appropriate quantification in each case. This
approach makes it possible to highlight not only the forms of
governmentality, but also the modalities of its critique (2014b: 57).

In the Keynesian State, sample research made it possible to
generalize price and family consumption indices – hitherto
restricted to salaried workers – to the population as a whole. In
addition, it creates a global space for monitoring the economy by
optimizing the GDP, on whose performance the construction of
the economic crisis as a social fact now depends.

Boltanski's sociology of criticism, which inspired the later works of
Desrosières (2008b, 2014b), and the more recent ones of Bruno
and Didier (2013, 2014), allowed us to have a finer understanding
of agency and the categories upon which it rests. voluntary
attempts to modify the foundations of social accounting. In this
key, statistics give institutional form to scattered aspirations and
concerns, enabling the formation of collective subjects mobilized
by different senses of justice and the authenticity of their claims.
Such an understanding illuminates the modes of criticism that
correspond to different types of statistics and that lead to reform and emancipation.

Finally, in the Neoliberal State, the feedback of indicators becomes
the purpose of political rationality anchored in benchmarking and
big data, even promoting the measurement of perception (on
identity, origin, ethnicity and race) as a means of reforming
conduct and induce social agency. In turn, the tradition of reform
and fight against inequality, formerly verticalized by the State as
the guarantor of public life, reappears in an expanded form with
the statistical activism of social movements. Quantification practices produce a

From this set of questions, the article introduces the concept of
“political regimes of quantification”, taking inspiration from the
contributions of Foucault and Desrosières, in order to specify
which levels of agency and social life were progressively
constructed as domains of commensuration. In the Liberal State,
this domain is the market , built as a space for veridiction and the
realization of justice – which presupposes the public availability of
equal information to the different economic actors, who, thus,
guide their behavior by production and price statistics. . In the
Providential State, the construction of work as a social sphere
involves the statistical creation of unemployment and the
unemployed person, and their linkage to concrete legal effects.
Thus enabling the indexation of wages and joint responsibility
between employers, unions, employees, bureaucrats and social
analysts, who begin to translate their interests based on cost of living and work accident statistics.

The 19th century was marked by the enthusiasm aroused by the creation of international

rankings that, promising to increase the progress and moral cohesion of societies, measured

and compared the performance of peoples and nations through indicators of industrialization,

urbanization, health and education. The 21st century is born under the sign of distrust in relation

to the advancement of quantification on the intimate and daily lives of individuals. Pressured by

performance goals and objectives, obliged to constantly monitor the risks involved in our food

and family, sexual and affective, medical and school, professional and personal life, we are

confronted with the discomfort of those who must act and decide based on spreadsheets

production charts, expense tables, insurance policies, accident statistics, opinion polls, laboratory

tests and ergometric tests: an infinity of quantification devices that define our image of failure

and success, as well as the fear and anxiety that correspond to them. Between the romantic

optimism of the past and the posthumanist skepticism of our time, there is a third attitude

towards numbers. An attitude that allows us to perceive the relationship between the ways in

which we are led to know ourselves and the way in which we are led to govern ourselves, making

room for criticizing the categories with which we think and represent reality and with which we

desire and practice freedom.

4. Statistical internationalism is the term by which the movement towards the globalization and
standardization of statistical production became known in historiography, based on
conventions emanating from collegiate decisions in specialized spaces - the so-called
International Congresses of Statistics, held from 1853 to 1876, which they debated the
fundamental issues of statistical practice, such as the normalization of classifications, the
precision in defining categories, the clarity of questionnaires and the procedures that suited
their application (Brian, 1999: 15-22).

reflective culture regarding the historical and socially situated dimensions of the instruments
of its practice; on the other hand, he always urged social scientists not to neglect the technical
nature of quantification. This effort was shown, early on, in his project to make a political and
administrative history of data production – at that first moment, not yet sociological. It is worth
mentioning the two volumes of Pour une histoire de la statistique, the result of the colloquia
he organized in 1976 and which brought together several Annales historians , such as JeanClaude
Perrot, Michele Perrot and Jacques Ozouf.

us more directly.

survey in 1936, by Morris Hansen and Edwards Deming. In the post-war period, it spread
among national statistical institutions, promoting profound transformations at the level of
statistical discourse, representations and work, analyzed by Beaud and Prévost (2010: 37-65).

This article interrogates the rôle des practices of quantification in the

quantification à d'autres technologies d'induction de conduite, dans le

produisent et consomment des libertés; d'autre part, la sociologie pragmatique
française, en particulier le concept de « conventions d'equivalence » et l'idee
de pluralité des logiques d'action, qui per attempt de comprendre la double
nature de la statistique comme « instrument de preuve » et comme «
instrument de gouvernement », formulated by Alain Des rosières, qui privilégie
la science des nombres et son rôle dans la coordination de la vie sociale. Nous
proposons une utilisation critique de ces modèles, en répétant une généalogie
