For Alain Supiot, the institutional crisis in which Europe is plunged precedes a way of thinking about
population governance that appeared at the beginning of modern times and continues to dominate the
normative imagination. This imaginary consists of representing governance as a technique of power, as a
machine whose functioning must be indexed in the form of human scientific knowledge. The forms of work
organization occupy a central space in these transformations and it is for this reason that Alain Supiot
dedicates a large space to new forms of management whose watchword is total mobilization at work
(Supiot, 2015).
In the same line of reasoning, Alain Supiot criticizes the legal positivism of the philosopher Hans Kelsen
and opts for an epistemological approach to the legal system, taking into account social sciences as a
relevant instrument for analyzing the legal system, which is inserted within social systems and forms of
governance. The book is structured in two parts: in the first the author analyzes the emergence of an
impersonal power where the dominant model is that of a machine that governs and leads to a new form of
governance based on numbers; in the second part, he returns to personal allégeance as a response to
the impasse of this governance (Supiot, 2015).

Alain Supiot's book, the result of classes at the Collège de France, starts from a definition of law as a
cultural fact that is part of the same logic as technique and the arts. Therefore, law is located between
technique and the arts whose epistemological reference is neither truth nor aesthetics, but justice. In a
previous book, the author analyzes the anthropological function of law, which was denied by the totalitarian
conception that reduced man to a unit of account manipulable by the mathematical rationality of capitalism
(Supiot, 2005). Thus, the legal order is inscribed within the imaginary institutions of society and, for this
reason, an analysis of this nature cannot be disarticulated from the material conditions of existence. This
materialist conception of the legal system implies that the law is always a possible response to the material
conditions imposed on the human species and the implication of this is that the analysis of the legal system
presupposes a socio-historical approach and, for this reason, the law cannot be found on transcendental
bases, nor can it be analyzed only as a technical object emptied of its social meanings (Supiot, 2015).

Law, moreover, also has an aesthetic dimension that extends to legal statements as a “complex field of
discourse” (Foucault, 1969, p.34). The authority and permanence of a rule depend on its literary quality
and the strength of the rule depends on the quality of the style (Supiot, 2015). The aesthetic and political
dimension of governance were left aside by those who see law as just an instrument of domination by the
popular classes. This aesthetic and political dimension has no place in the rationalist and mechanistic
vision that dominates political philosophy from modern times to the present day. From the moment that
institutions are represented under the model of a machine, it becomes difficult to understand the central
space that aesthetics must occupy in the art of governing.

Thus, the distinction is between legal qualification that passes through language (criticism of
nomenclature) and interpretation and statistical qualification that operates in secret and based on
conventions that are subject to rules that do not compare with legal qualification (Supiot, 2015). Statistical
quantification escapes the principle of contradiction and remains a privileged field for technicians in
statistics and economics. The author's criticism is directed, in particular, at the statisticians who produce
the indicators that are used by the government, above all to support public and economic policies.

The legal sociology of quantification in Alain Supiot

For the author, the central principle is that the legal text should not be isolated from its historical,
anthropological and socioeconomic context, as this is the condition for understanding recent social phenomena
based on a legal analysis. The rule of law does not precede exclusively the observation of facts, and these
do not help to see society as it is, but as a society should be thought and organized, therefore this legal
representation is one of the drivers of society's transformation ( Supiot, 2015).

In this way, work becomes the object of a scientific organization and is reduced to a succession of simple
and measurable gestures. The “scientific” organization of work aimed to extort from the worker as much
income as possible, enclosing him “in a system of obligations that took away any margin of initiative” (Gorz,
2004, P. 38). To the physical model of the clock, which leads to seeing man as a machine, is added the
biological model of natural selection inspired by social Darwinism, which is useful for liberalism and the
limitless competition of all against all.

In this sense, legal analysis poses a real methodological problem, since the complex relationships between
the text of the law and the social context cannot be understood without the contribution of research in other
areas of knowledge, such as the sciences. human and social issues that feed comparative research. Now,
this same methodological problem is expanded with the theme of quantification, which is accelerating in the
contemporary period and this leads to increasingly specialized work by practical jurists, but also in other
areas of knowledge (Supiot, 2015).
The author makes a historical retrospective based on the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle and states that,
since modern times, the old Greek ideal of a city founded on laws and not on men takes on a new form which
is governance conceived under the model of a machine. It is precisely with industrial society that industries
and power plants emerge, as well as labor law, whose history is intertwined with the history of capitalism
(Supiot, 2004).

The ideal of impersonal power takes on a new dimension after the Second World War, where number
progressively becomes the basis of obligations between men and this imaginary of governance is that of a
society without heteronomy where the law gives way to programming and , once programmed, the individual
does not act freely, that is, he starts to behave according to the expected reactions. This movement was
engaged by Soviet planning in which, for the first time, the law was reduced to an instrument for applying the
pragmatic utility of calculation (Supiot, 2015). This new representation corresponds to the transition from
economic liberalism, which placed economic calculation under the control of the law, to neoliberalism, which
places the law under the aegis of calculation and economic and financial interests (Supiot, 2015).

The analysis of communist regimes made by Alain Supiot is, in the conception of statistician Jacky Fayole,
of paramount importance for thinking about the Soviet statistical system and the transition to a market
economy. For Ejov, in Lenin's conception, statisticians should be assistants to the party and government and
Lenin placed the entire statistical apparatus at the service of building communism (Ejov, apud Fayolle, 1987).
Thus, the ideology of the market is increasingly strengthened with the instrumentalization of statistical
engineering that not only quantifies, but decides on the units to be observed and the nomenclature that
classifies and analyzes certain dimensions of the quantified phenomena making, at the same time, an
economy of conventions (Desrosières, 2014).

It turns out that the dominant representation of this society is marked by classical physics that conceived
the world as a big clock with its implacable weights and shapes. To better understand the nature of the
problem, the author's epistemological starting point is the notion of governance and not that of governability,
by Michel Foucault (2001). Alain Supiot reminds us that we cannot forget that the mechanistic and rationalist
paradigm are techniques of manipulation and communication.

Supiot analyzes the transformation of a society based on the rule of law and the emergence of a society
based on the rule of numbers. According to him, the latter forms part of a long history of the illusion of
harmonization through calculation in which the last innovation occurred with the numerical revolution, passing
through statistical reason, as Alain Desrosières would say ( Desrosières, 1993). Such a transformation has
effects that increase social inequalities that may be similar to what happened in the 19th century, when
traditional solidarity was destroyed by capitalism. Solidarity that was based on family, religious and
professional relationships and was questioned, with great brutality, by the first industrialization, as is well
exemplified in the case of colonization and slavery. Today, it is the state forms of solidarity, established within
the framework of the welfare state, to minimize the absence of traditional solidarities, which are being
progressively deregulated. The globalization project conceives the world as a total market composed of
opposing particles based on relationships based on interested calculation. The question is to know, Supiot
tells us, to what extent legal analysis can contribute to clarify these transformations. In this sense, he does
not skimp on epistemological and methodological reflection.

The paradigm of quantification, present in all parts of the world, occupies the central place of a fundamental
norm on a global scale. This paradigm destroys the Social State (which in turn is represented as a machine)
whose objective is not to eradicate new forms of dehumanization of work, but rather to compensate for its
effects and make work humanly bearable. For André Gorz, “social benefits and considerations do not
reconcile populations with capitalist society, nor do permanent negotiation and arbitration procedures
dismantle social antagonisms.” (Gorz, 2004,18-19). The subjection of the individual who conducts governance
through numbers does not only concern the people, but individuals and companies (Supiot, 2015).

This paradigm of objectivity represents men as objects and, in this perspective, the art of governing
presents itself as an immense machine that statistical engineers dominate with mastery. It is in the way of
thinking about the European legal system that we can find this way of thinking about governance under the
model of the machine and this is what Alain Supiot observes in Hobbes' physical anthropology in which the
body must bend to the model of the clock (Supiot, 2015).

Alain Supiot analyzes at length the effects that governance through numbers has on labor relations that
have constituted, since the industrial era, the basis of all forms of governance and the main indicator of
economic policies. In this conception of management, the mobilization of a person at the service of

The author's fundamental criticism is directed at statistics as a science of the State. To do this, Alain
Supiot is explicitly based on the sociology of quantification by statistician and sociologist Alain Desrosières,
who elaborates a typology of five forms of State, which equally correspond to different ways of using
statistics. The hypothesis of the sociology of quantification is that, as a set of socially accepted conventions
and measurement operations, a new way of thinking, representing the world and acting on it is created.
When quantification procedures are codified and enter everyday life, the initial conventions are forgotten
and the quantified object is naturalized (Desrosières, 2014).

Alain Supiot highlights that large transnational companies occupy a space in the neoliberal world
comparable to that occupied by the State. The game of influence between large companies and the State
is strong and tends to limit social rights in general and labor law in particular when considering, above all,
the effects of outsourcing on labor relations. The effects of the paradigm of governance based on numbers
appear at the moment when the subjection of workers imposes “the imperative of competitiveness, making
them elevate the interests of the company above even their health and their lives” (Gorz, 2004 p. 41).
Legal notions are products of Western history and for this reason they must also be problematized and
regarding this, the author makes a reflective analysis of the legal categories of thought.

Statistical quantification has this dual nature as it is an instrument of coordination, administration and
management that is more political and is at the same time an instrument of proof that constitutes more of
a more prestigious scientific dimension.
The conception of the scientific administration of the State became banal with the frequent references
to Max Weber's notions of rationalization and bureaucracy and Foucault's governability. But Max Weber
was a pioneer in the analysis of the forms of exercise of power “underlining the importance of devices
embodying a legal, formal rationality, in the development of capitalist societies, he made the place of
material technologies of government autonomous in relation to the classic theories centered mainly on
sovereignty and legitimacy of rulers” (Lascoumes and Galès, 2012, p.23). Desrosières' interest is to
analyze this rationalization taking into account the technical instruments of statistics in their political
dimension, their structure and content that is congruent with ways of thinking about society and acting on
it. The sociology of quantification questions the different ways of thinking about the State and the role of
statistics in the different possible forms of the State.

The uncritical notion of globalization, for Alain Supiot, expresses a slogan followed by an ideological
belief in the inevitable expansion of Western culture across the planet (Supiot, 2015). This is not the case
with the notion of globalization, which makes us think about the diversity of cultures that are configured as
distinct forms of habitus. This critical notion opposes the conception of uniformity of the world under the
Western model. According to the author, it is necessary to avoid the illusion of the essentialist and positivist
conception of legal culture as invariant structures that persist in being, as well as that of the end of history
and the triumph of Western culture over other cultures.

Governance through numbers is based on the encrypted representation of the world disconnected from
experience (Supiot, 2015). This submission has a price which is the elimination of consideration for people
and the good use of quantification presupposes respect for the human person who should not be confused
with a machine, which presupposes a sense of the extent to which the law can help maintain or restore ,
imposing respect for the principle of contradiction in the elaboration and interpretation of numbers linked
to a normative force. Restore the legal system in the sense that the measure cannot be made without a
political questioning of the power acquired today, in most countries, by the plutocratic ruling classes,
where the norm has nothing mystical and the limitless cupidity as well as the power devastating made the
critique of capitalism instituted by Marx current (Supiot, 2015).

From this same perspective of domination, the programmable man is born, whose emergence is due to
cybernetics and the numerical revolution. The computer obeys a program and not legal rules. Thus, a
reified conception of work is established. The ideology is that it is necessary to program to optimize
performance according to economic and financial interests. It is in this way that political democracy is
denied in the name of numerical management and administration (Supiot, 2015).

The conception of the Social State no longer corresponds to the reality of Europe, since it has been
replaced by a cybernetic representation that dominates today's programmed society whose ideal is
governance through numbers. The author's central hypothesis is that the welfare state crisis reveals a
much deeper institutional rupture that affects the Western way of conceiving administration, the
management of society and governance, as it is from numbers that became the dominant model. The idea
of the welfare state leads the author to conclude that the Law or bureaucracy are considered, in his
analysis, not only as a framework for legal analysis, but as categories that must be problematized in the
interest of better understanding the major institutional transformations in process under the umbrella of
globalization (Supiot, 2015).

In this sense, Eric Hobsbawm's reflection on the current nature of Marx's thought is part of the same
line of epistemological reasoning as Alain Supiot (Hobsbawmn, 2014). When analyzing the level of
dogmatism of neoliberal economic doctrine, even in the legal sphere, Alain Supiot considers that criticism
of this belief system has the chance of engendering, in the market of ideas that is today a public space,
possible alternatives to the dominant system governance based on numbers.

In this sense, for Alain Supiot, what characterizes governance is that it is not based on the legitimacy of
a law that must be obeyed, but on the capacity that all human beings have to adapt their behaviors to new
material and social conditions, more specifically this notion designates the internalization of norms and
the elimination of heterogeneity. Governance through numbers and autonomy is not intended to limit the
individual's action, but rather to program the set of activities in the field of work. And, based on Bourdieu,
the author defines this type of state as a metaphysical state (Supiot, 2015).

This analysis would allow us to better see the uncertainties present in the job market and the insecurity
in the field of work where numerical governance is the dominant logic. On the other hand, young workers
find in the company an identity that is denied to them in global society and this creates the ideal
conditions for the subjection of worker domination. Quantification is something so naturalized that the
individual does not realize the effects of this mode of governance. In this sense, the book by Alain Supiot
is of paramount importance for understanding the legal nature of quantification and its harmful effects on
personal life and society as a whole. At the current juncture, Alain Supiot's conception is central to the
legal understanding of labor reforms in both France and Brazil.

This theory of harmony based on calculation is justified, ideologically, by mathematics as a central
element for the intelligibility of the world and this legitimizes management methods based on quantification
and accounting, as a way of rationally accounting for the results of production.

Discover, 1993.

This happens when the State no longer ensures its regulatory role in the economy, in defending the
identity and physical and economic security of the population. The change from a society based on
subordination to one based on programming is a central point in the contemporary representation of
human action and modes of governance based on numbers. The machine to govern is no longer
conceived under the clock model, but under the computer model and in this way the governance of
numbers supplants the governance of laws, without forgetting that these are the result of conventions (Supiot, 2015).

Probability calculus itself is both prescriptive and normative. Well, but the author does not fail to consider
that mathematics is a powerful instrument and is also a space for mystical and aesthetic experience that
must be placed at the service of man.
The aesthetic dimension of mathematics clearly demonstrates the fascination it has exerted since
Pythagoras, but it also points to the dangers of subjecting the legal system and society to the order of
calculation. In this sense, the problem of quantification is an object of law insofar as it is not only objects
that are quantifiable, but people are also classified according to the quantity produced, the worker is
reclassified according to productivity and this has legal implications in work relationships. Quantification
becomes a norm for judgment and numbers emerge as modes of social control of individuals (Supiot,
2015).

Considering what Alain Supiot states in this book, we conclude that despite the methodological
difficulties, legal analysis can help to understand the multiple crises that are spreading with globalization,
with the constant growth of inequalities, the end of credit, etc. The social foundations on which the world
order was based deregulated both national states and international organizations. The perspective
adopted by the author is indispensable to legally understand how impersonal governance was already
present in the realm of law and takes on new forms in governance through numbers.

For Alain Supiot, the ideology of law can be as harmful as that of numbers. In this context, the law
becomes an object of calculation, a mere legislative product competing in the global market for standards.
The chances for the return of the kingdom of laws are non-existent due to the durable establishment of
the governance of numbers. The problem, for the author, is that markets must be reinserted into society
and stop reducing human life and economic life to a market economy. And also restore the principle of
economic and legal democracy, as the social state constitutes a first attempt at such an ordering of the
economy within society (Supiot, 2015).

Capitalism, for Alain Supiot, has transformed into anarcho-capitalism that erases borders, subjects
States to capital and dismantles the rules for protecting fictitious markets such as nature, work and
currency as identified by Karl Polanyi. The need for this dismantling is ideologically justified on a daily
basis by the modern equivalent of religious preaching that is the media. Like every ideology that loses its
sense of limit, anarcho-capitalism is condemned to find its catastrophic limit and this happens when
mental representation ignores the principle of reality.

The company must be total in the sense that it targets both the spirit and the body; mechanical obedience
to orders gives way to programming as a way of managing work. In this sense, a sphere of autonomy
granted to the worker must be used to achieve established objectives and, thus, visible power is replaced
by invisible and decentralized power. This autonomy in subordination means that the worker becomes
transparent in relation to the employer who, at any time, can measure and evaluate his productivity. The
objectives are inseparable from the coded indicators that are decided arbitrarily and that measure the
worker's performance. In this sense, the worker is reified from his experience of the world in which he
closes himself in speculative frameworks and cannot extract from this situation anything other than fraud
or psychic illness.

Right at the beginning of the book, Alain Supiot states that to fully understand the legal dimension of
governance through numbers it is necessary not to limit ourselves to the organization of the city and the
company, but to consider the state of people and their private lives. Now, following this reasoning, the
book would make a greater contribution if the author had developed ways of evaluating higher education
institutions and researchers who are subjected to the logic of productivity. From the moment society is
represented as a system of elementary particles linked by the calculation of individual interest, this
imaginary is expressed in all fields of human life and produces its effects.

The economic crisis of 2008 offers us a bitter taste of this catastrophic limit that found arguments to
dismantle the social state. It is predictable that this dismantling will lead to the imposition of high levels
of inequalities to the detriment of the democratic principle, which will lead to unprecedented violence that
combines with ecological disasters engendered by the overexploitation of natural resources.
