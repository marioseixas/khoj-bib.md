Introduction

LIKE EVERY WORK of human hand, our institutions bear the imprint
of the ideas which helped bring them into being. Law is an institution
in this sense, a cultural fact like technology, religion or the arts,
which contain and preserve an era ’ s dominant representations of the world.
Of course, every body of representations — technology, law, the arts, and so
forth — has its own internal system of reference. Although an airplane may
be the incarnation of the human being ’ s dream of soaring into the sky, as
a technological object it depends on the truth of the scientifi c knowledge
which enabled its construction. This necessary reliance on the value of scientifi
c truth is what distinguishes modern from older technological objects,
the latter being simply ‘ traps set at the points where nature can be grasped ’ ,
1
as Jean-Pierre Vernant puts it, that is, recipes deduced from what works or
fails to work. Art, by contrast, has no such obligation towards truth, and
can free itself entirely from the weightiness of the world as it is. However, a
work of art needs to have an aesthetic value, at least in principle, and this is
the yardstick by which it will be judged.
Law occupies a position halfway between art and technology. Its referent
is neither truth, nor the aesthetic, but justice. However, just as a zeppelin
may be dangerous, and a painting, botched, so a legal rule can be unjust.
Yet even saying this implies a reference to what a legal rule should be. In
common with art, law inhabits a world of fi ction — for example a republic
in which freedom, equality and fraternity reign. But in common with technology,
law aims to act on the real world and must consequently take it
into account. These two aspects interact, each being part of what Cornelius
Castoriadis has called the imaginary institution of society. 2 ‘ Imaginary ’does
not imply that our institutions are creations of pure fantasy, born out of
the magma of representations inhabiting us from cradle to grave. On the
contrary: instituting individuals in society means removing them from that
magma so that they may ‘ gain access to society and the world of signifi cation
as a world belonging to all and to no one ’ .
3 This world of shared meaning,
which is imposed through the instituting of the psyche, is itself produced by

a social imaginary which, for society to survive, must be compatible with
the prevailing physical and biological conditions of existence.
The legal order is also part of this imaginary institution of society. It cannot
be divorced from a society ’ s material conditions, but neither can it be
deduced from these. The law is always one of the possible responses to the
challenges which material conditions pose to humankind. 4 This is why it is
as futile to seek to ground law transcendentally as it is to explain it away
in terms of its material base, or analyse it as a technological object devoid
of meaning. What natural law theory, materialist theory of law (based on
biologism, sociologism, and economism) and Kelsenian positivism have in
common is that they are all based on a subject – object dichotomy, which is
a specifi cally Western way of conceiving relations to the world. Although
we owe much to this way of thinking — on which, for instance, the natural
sciences have thrived — it can blind us to the irreducible singularity of the
human being. Our denatured animal may well project onto the world the
images which inhabit him, using words and tools, but he can only survive
if he is also aware of the realities of his ecumene, 5 his living environment. 6
The industrial imaginary, 7 dominated by the laws of classical physics,
gave us electrifi cation, the fi lm Metropolis, and labour law. The world was
conceived as a huge clock advancing through the implacable interaction
of weights and forces, which could be harnessed by human beings, but to
which they were also subjected. The social state itself was designed as a
machine, to correct the imbalances caused by industrial progress. It never
aimed to eradicate the new forms of dehumanisation which appeared in
the workplace, but instead to compensate for their effects and make them
humanly bearable. It is at odds with today ’ s cybernetic imaginary which
champions governance by numbers. This new, and dominant, representation
of how people and societies should function not only saps the social
state but, more critically, it undermines our very conception of the state as
it has been handed down to us from the Gregorian Reform of the eleventh
to twelfth century, as a transcendent and immortal being. 8 The hypothesis
on which this book rests is that the ‘ crisis of the welfare state ’is a sign of a
much deeper institutional break, which affects the specifi cally Western way
in which the ‘ government of men ’has been conceived. This is why we will
not be treating the state, the law or democracy as parameters for a legal

analysis, but as categories which must themselves be re-examined in order
to understand the far-reaching institutional changes taking place under the
name of ‘ globalisation ’ .
In order to approach this crisis of institutions, a much broader concept
will be introduced: that of ‘ government ’ , and its contemporary form,
‘ governance ’ . There is nothing new about broaching issues of law and institutions
in terms of the ‘ government of men ’ . In Locke ’ s Two Treatises of
Government (1st edn, 1690), the notion of state appears only in ‘ State of
Nature ’and ‘ State of War ’ , which are forms of power outside the realm
of the law. To designate a system under the authority of the law, Locke
uses the term ‘ Commonwealth ’(Republic) and not ‘ State ’ . He thus marks
his difference from Hobbes, who equates ‘ State ’with ‘ Res Publica ’or
‘ Commonwealth ’ . So we have only to cross the Channel for the general
validity and self-evidence of the concept of state to evaporate. Much more
recently, Michel Foucault has used the notion of government, or more precisely,
‘ governmentality ’ , to designate all forms of exercise of power. 9 In
addition to the authority of these authors, there is a further, and much more
decisive argument for our focus on ‘ government ’ : today, within the institutional
confi gurations taking shape, it is transnational companies that occupy
a role comparable to that of states. The methods of government employed
by states and by businesses for governing people have always interacted, as
from the industrial age. By employing the concept of ‘ government ’it will be
possible to track these mutual infl uences and address today ’ s institutional
transformations as a coherent whole.
The critical distance taken from the concept of the state is necessary but
not suffi cient for analysing the legal dimension of ‘ globalisation ’ . Other
associated legal notions must also be re-examined because they too are
products of the West, as is the notion of ‘ State ’ — and that of ‘ government ’ .
We take for granted, for example, that governing and exercising power
are one and the same thing. But this assimilation — even in the form of
Foucault ’ s ‘ biopower ’ — is by no means self-evident. It is symptomatic of
a culture and an epoch (Western culture and our present times), which it
would be childish to try and escape, since this is our world, but which we
must try to situate in relation to other ways of conceiving the legal organisation
of human societies.
The purpose of critically examining our categories of thought is not to
dismiss them, but rather to circumscribe them, and understand how deeply
they are embedded in the history of Western legal thought. In other words,

these notions should be used knowingly, rather than letting them do the
thinking for us. The reference to ‘ the West ’here is to be understood in a
particular sense, connected with the long history of our institutions and
more specifi cally with our culture ’ s grounding in Roman law. When Rome
split into Western and Eastern Empires, this was not only a political and
religious schism, it was also a crucial moment in the history of law. The
fall of the Western Empire in 476 produced an institutional void which the
Catholic Church was called upon to fi ll, leading to the medieval period ’ s
solutions of Roman and Canon law, from which our modern concept of the
state emerged. Meanwhile, the Eastern Roman Empire survived until 1453,
roughly 1,000 years later. There, a symbiosis developed between the priesthood
( hi é r ô sin è ) and the Empire ( basileia), from which emerged the fi gure
of a monarch who is also a priest. 10 Western leaders ’staggering ignorance
of the specifi c heritage of the post-Byzantine world has caused centuries of
incomprehension; for example, the vision of Greece as the direct descendant
of Athenian democracy (which affected the conditions placed on Greece ’ s
entry into the EU) or the diffi culties encountered by Europe in establishing
pacifi ed relations with Russia.
Within Western legal culture, two branches have developed — continental
law and common law. They harbour a common, if rivalrous, wish to
westernise the world, but in our post-colonial era, it is their confl icting
institutional forms which take centre stage. 11 The acritical catchword
‘ globalisation ’refers to the expansion of a certain Western culture over the
whole globe. The French language enables us to analyse this process more
precisely, and to envisage another perspective, through the crucial distinction
between la globalisation, and la mondialisation. La mondialisation—
‘ worldisation ’ — is derived from the Latin ‘ mundus ’ , which is the opposite of
‘ immundus ’in much the same way that the Greek ‘ cosmos ’is the opposite
of ‘ chaos ’ . La mondialisation evokes the diversity of civilisations; that is,
the different ways of inhabiting the planet and of making it humanly viable.
An uninhabitable world resembles, precisely, a reversion of the cosmos to
chaos. 12 La mondialisation does not imply the advent of a standardised
world based on Western ways, but instead, the West ’ s encounter with other
ways of conceiving how society may be instituted; ways which are, in turn,
challenged by Western modernity. This dynamic should force us to abandon
both the illusions produced by an essentialist reading of legal cultures qua
invariants persisting in their being, and the idea that history is coming to an
end, with the victory of Western civilisation over all others.

The interaction of these reciprocal challenges can be felt with particular
force in the history of social legislation. In nineteenth-century Europe, the
forces of capitalism crushed traditional systems of solidarity. These were
based on family, religious, geographical and occupational bonds, which
were destroyed to varying degrees by Europe ’ s fi rst industrial revolution,
and then no less brutally with colonisation and the slave trade. Today, it is
state systems of solidarity, designed for nationwide coverage, and invented
precisely to palliate the weakening of traditional solidarities, which are
under threat. From the perspective of the total market, which globalisation
aspires to, society is simply a swarm of contracting particles whose relations
to each other are based purely on calculated self-interest. Calculation — and
hence the contract — thus comes to occupy the place previously assigned to
the law as the normative reference.
This new utopia is no more likely to succeed than those which preceded
it in the twentieth century, when the founding reference for the political
order was the laws of biology or of history. As soon as Nazism and Real
Communism were obliged to confront the limits imposed by reality, this
proved catastrophic for their unbounded ambitions. Today, the pressure of
globalisation on all cultures has triggered a powerful backlash of religious,
ethnic, regionalist and nationalist identifi cations. Their common hallmark
is to look for new solidarities grounded neither in tradition nor in the state,
but rather in solidarities of combat based on the binary opposition — dear
to Carl Schmitt 13— of friend and enemy, which try to fi nd justifi cation in
fundamentalist re-readings of dogmatic corpuses.
So how, and under what conditions, can a legal analysis help shed light
on these transformations ?Law occupies a strange position as a fi eld of
knowledge. Due to the medieval origins of modern law, Western jurists tend
to see it as a self-enclosed system which can have no fruitful interactions
with other domains.
However, law can best be understood as the secular equivalent of the
systems of mandatory rules which, in other times and cultures, originated —
or still originate — in shared belief and religious ritual. Every legal system
rests on what the American Declaration of Independence calls ‘ self-evident
truths ’ , that is, on a dogmatic basis which makes the system meaningful and
authorises interpretation:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these
are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights,
Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent
of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive
of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to
6 Introduction

institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing
its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety
and Happiness.

This founding text presents a series of logical deductions. It starts by supposing
the existence of individual rights, in a clearly dogmatic gesture: just
like the creator, rights are ‘ self-evident ’ , a truth which thus requires no demonstration,
but should instead be proclaimed and celebrated. This dogmatic
core grounds the power of government, while simultaneously limiting it in
two ways: the government must have the consent of those governed; and
its power should be used to defend the people ’ s rights. If the government
fails in this, the people have the right — a collective right this time — to put
power into the hands of another group which can better guarantee security
and happiness. The word ‘ happiness ’appears twice in the Declaration: fi rst,
as the object of an individual quest which each citizen must be allowed to
pursue freely; and again as the happiness of the people as a whole when it is
ruled by a good government.
So law has a dogmatic basis, but it is also a technique of government,
which people may use as they see fi t. This duality explains the abyss existing
between the supporters of legal positivism, who exclude any axiological
considerations from their approach to the ‘ science of law ’ ; and those who
swear by a natural foundation to legal systems, an immanent or transcendant
order considered universally valid, against which positive law can be
measured, and which it should simply serve.
However, in reality, no serious legal analysis can opt for either the technical
or the axiological dimension of law. A legal analysis should certainly not
dissolve the text in its context, as sociologising and economistic approaches
do. But neither should it divorce the text entirely from its historical, anthropological
and socio-economic contexts. If these two conditions are not
met, a legal analysis will be unable to contribute to our understanding of
phenomena which anyway no single knowledge area can explain. Unlike
biological or economic norms, legal rules are not derived from the observation
of fact. They are not the imprint of the world as it is, but rather what
a society thinks the world should be. It is thus a representation which can
help bring about change.
The specifi c task of a legal analysis is thus to apprehend what ought to be,
not directly what is. This defi nition is not intended to exclude the dynamic
relation between is and ought (and additionally the realm of the purely
imaginary), which exists in every human action. But we would insist that
it cannot be grasped unless the systems of representation which leave their
imprint on the law in a given society are fi rst identifi ed. There is much at
stake in the gap between these formal representations and the real state of
the world. If the gap is too large, or if it widens, then the legal order will be
disqualifi ed by reality, and its credibility will be undermined. This is what
Introduction 7

happens when the law — which should be equally binding on all — simply
masks a system ruled by privilege and personal allegiances. On the collapse
of Real Communism, for example, the state lost all credibility, and what
replaced it were negotiated ‘ arrangements ’based on calculations of individual
interest alone. But a system of law can also implement, at least partially,
the vision of the world it advocates. Tocqueville ’ s analyses, for example,
testify to the strength of the principle of equality once it had gained constitutional
value. And although it is clear that, for example, there are still today
many inequalities between men and women, and thus a gap between the law
and the facts on the ground, the normative force of the principle of equality
has just as clearly narrowed that gap.
For a legal analysis to be productive, it must thus take into account the
historical and geographical relativity of the law, which is not a universal and
atemporal feature of human societies. But it must also take into account the
centrality of legal rules, which are the only form of normativity to be the
object of deliberation, and conscious of its own status, as well as binding
on everyone. 14 With this relativity and centrality in mind, legal analysis can
help detect the normativity at work in scientifi c disciplines, which often
unknowingly mobilise legal categories while attributing to them a universal
heuristic value. These categories, which frequently originate in Roman
law — ‘ civilisation ’ , ‘ contract ’ , ‘ law ’and ‘ religion ’ , for instance — are extensively
used in economics and sociology. Many others — such as ‘ heritage ’
and ‘ heredity ’ — have infl uenced biology.
This treatment of law as a cultural fact attracts two types of criticism.
The fi rst, voiced by social scientists, accuses this type of analysis of relying
on ideological constructs rather than confi ning itself to the facts. The second,
from legal positivists, at the other extreme, accuses it of betraying the integrity
of the law by attending to the law ’ s contexts. On this basis, neither
Montesquieu, nor Portalis and Carbonnier can have contributed anything
at all to the science of law! But it is precisely when the study of law draws
on this intellectual tradition that it can help us understand the upheavals of
today ’ s world.
A legal analysis as we defi ne it here poses major methodological problems.
The complex links between text and context cannot be identifi ed and
understood without studying historical and comparative works. As a result,
the quality of a legal analysis begins to depend on readings from other fi elds,
which in turn exposes jurists, despite themselves, to getting drawn into the
controversies of other disciplines.
In addition to this fi rst set of methodological diffi culties, which relate to
setting the text in context, there is a second group, which is internal to law.
The extraordinary infl ation of the law since the beginning of modern times,

and even more so today, has led to increasing specialisation on the part of
jurists, both practitioners and researchers. At the same time, one cannot
address fundamental questions affecting the development of law as a whole
without leaving behind the comforts of a particular branch of law. What
is required is a kind of ‘ intra-disciplinarity ’ , despite the obstacles posed by
the exponential increase in legal sources and the fragmentation of research
across increasingly narrow specialisations.
The division of law into branches is a relatively recent product of the
analytical study of law, or legal dogmatics, and dates from the jurists of
Renaissance humanism and the legal theorists of the Reform. So it was only in
the sixteenth century that law began to be conceived as having branches and
sub-branches corresponding to the subjects treated. This approach, called
usus modernus, was part of a larger movement affecting both theology
and philosophy. 15 Today, certain signs, and the return of certain techniques
employed by medieval jurists, suggest that the usus modernus no longer
holds. In medieval times, the legal order was not compartmentalised, and
operations of qualifi cation did not consist of slotting a case into a category
of subject matter. Jurists could solve a case by appealing to general principles
or to rules borrowed from different subject areas.
Over the last century, the branches of law have multiplied, for practical
(the increased number of sources) rather than epistemological reasons.
This ramifi cation is of importance for the profession, but its heuristic power
is weak and perhaps getting weaker. It is particularly weak in the case of
labour and social security law, a historically recent branch, which straddles
private and public law, and has greater or lesser scope depending on the particular
country and its judicial and administrative systems. Any advanced
research will almost inevitably transgress the fi eld ’ s constituted boundaries,
and oblige the jurist to venture onto terrain less familiar than his or her
original specialism, with all the risks this involves.
Despite all these diffi culties, a legal analysis can help one get one ’ s bearings
within the many calamities, of varying intensity, precipitated by globalisation
throughout the world: increasing ecological threats, a massive
rise in inequalities, mass pauperisation and migration, the return of religious
wars and cultural isolationism, the collapse of political credibility and of
fi nancial systems, and so forth. We are a far cry from the radiant future
announced by the prophets of the end of history and of a harmoniously globalised
world. All these upheavals interact and amplify each other like dif-

ferent centres of the same fi re. They have one factor in common: the decay
of national and international institutions. The institutional bases on which
a new world order was set up at the end of the Second World War have been
profoundly dislocated, affecting countries and international organisations
alike. People today cast around for a fi gure capable of protecting the planet,
the value of the currency or justice in the world. They settle on God and the
market, sometimes together, since monotheism and faith in a total market
are well matched in the minds of fundamentalists, whatever their religion.
After all, is not the ‘ invisible hand ’of the market simply a secular version of
Divine Providence ? 16
Whether it is God or the market which is called to the rescue in the
various upheavals we are undergoing, the result always seems to be that
collective deliberation is muzzled. In other words, the ideal of a res publica
governed by the laws a people gives itself seems to end up abandoned or
betrayed. This ideal, which has come down to us from the Greeks, rests on
fragile foundations, and its history has not been smooth. It was utterly discredited
by the twentieth century ’ s totalitarian regimes based on scientistic
norms, but it was solemnly reaffi rmed in 1948 by the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, whose Preamble states that ‘ it is essential, if man is not to
be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny
and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law ’ .
This ideal is offi cially still our own, and so in the fi rst part of this book we
shall give an historical account of the many forms it has taken, in order
better to grasp the critical challenges it has faced over the last century. This
chronological contextualisation is vital for understanding how the promise
of an impersonal government, which was already part of this ideal, came to
take the form today of a governance by numbers. 17
Since the reign of the law is intimately bound up with state sovereignty,
this regime has suffered from the latter ’ s decline. Today, the state seems to
be relegated once again to the instrumental role it had under totalitarian
regimes, and criticised as an archaic and oppressive fi gure. Where previously
it was the plaything of a single party supposedly embodying the movement
of history, the state has become the instrument of a total market which
enlists all individuals into a world of unending competition, in which all
aspects of human life are measured in economic terms. In this context, laws
themselves become the object of a calculation, treated as legislative products

competing on a global market of norms. This gearing of the law to calculations
of utility already operated in Soviet central planning. Thereafter,
thanks to the unholy union of communism and capitalism — as from 1979,
when the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping launched his economic reforms —
this subjection took the form of a governance by numbers which penetrates
every level of society, from the individual employment relationship to the
structural adjustment plans promoted at European and international level.
The overthrow of the reign of the law by governance by numbers
enacts the dream of an arithmetically attainable social harmony. The latest
incarnation of this dream in its long history are the ICT and digital revolutions,
to which we all seem enthralled. The latter are based on a cybernetic
imaginary, which produces to an idea of normativity not as legislation but
as programming. 18 People are no longer expected to act freely within the
limits laid down by the law, but to react in real time to the multiple signals
they receive, in order to meet the targets they are assigned. Ways of thinking
about work have been particularly affected by this development, which is
why the second half of this book is devoted to the new forms taken today
by the imperative of ‘ total mobilisation ’ , which fi rst appeared as Taylorism
at the time of the First World War. The fate of Taylorism, and of ‘ total
mobilisation[ ’ s] ’new avatar, governance by numbers, demonstrates the
failure awaiting all normative systems founded on denying the specifi cally
human capacities of thinking and acting independently. Today, with the
withering-away of the state and the new forms of alienation this brings, a
typically feudal legal structure is re-emerging, consisting of networks of allegiance
within which each person seeks the protection of someone stronger
than he is, or the support of someone weaker.
This book therefore follows a double movement. First, the quest for an
impersonal model of power, epitomised by the ‘ machine of government ’ ,
which has led to governance by numbers. Secondly, the return of personal
allegiance as a reaction to the failures of governance.

In Search of a Machine
of Government

‘ To treat a person as a thing or as a purely mechanical system is not less but more
imaginary than claiming to see him as an owl. ’

EUROPE ’ S PRESENT INSTITUTIONAL disarray can be attributed
to a certain way of conceiving government, which emerged with the
modern age and continues to dominate our normative representations.
The premise is that governing, as simply a technique of power, operates
likes a machine, in this case a machine based on scientifi c knowledge of
the human being. Yet there is nothing self-evident about equating rule with
power. Or rather, one could say that this reduction is fairly symptomatic of a
civilisation and an epoch which it would be childish to think one could simply
leave behind, since it is still ours, but which we should attempt to situate
in relation to other ways of conceiving human government. By exploring the
aesthetic and poetic dimensions of government, we shall be able to relativise
our own imaginary of the machine of government, and understand today ’ s
shift from government to governance.

I. THE POETICS OF GOVERNMENT

‘ Government ’draws etymologically on a nautical terminology (the Greek
kybernan ( κυβερναω), via the Latin gubernō). To govern is to be at the helm,
directing both the movements of the boat and its crew. But not all civilisations
have conceived the organisation of human communities on this model
of commands and constraints imposed on both men and things. The ethnobotanist
Andr éHaudricourt considers this model to be typical of predominantly
pastoral societies. 1 By contrast, in societies where agriculture is more
important, the image of the shepherd or the helmsman, who leads men with
a stick, acting on them directly, is replaced by that of the gardener, who acts
indirectly by creating the conditions which will enable each plant to thrive.

In the Confucian tradition, for example, the government guarantees the
harmony which enables subjects to fulfi l their functions as best they can.
The person who deserves to govern is one whose virtue shines forth: ‘ When
a prince ’ s personal conduct is correct, his government is effective without
the issuing of orders. If his personal conduct is not correct, he may issue
orders, but they will not be followed. ’ 2
So, reducing governing to the exercise of power is a typically Western
idea. It has its origin in what Kantorowicz, in his research into the medieval
origins of modern institutions, calls the disintegration of the ideal of
liturgical royalty, when the fi gure of power split off from that of authority. 3
We tend to forget that this combination was precisely what made a government
stable, as Cicero insists much earlier, in his dialogue De re publica:

If there is not an equitable balance in the State of rights and duties and responsibilities,
so that there is enough power in the hands of the magistrates and enough
authority in the judgment of the aristocrats and enough freedom in the people,
then the condition of the commonwealth cannot be preserved unchanged. 4

Quentin Skinner has shown, in a magnifi cent short text, 5 that this tradition
was still active in the political thought of the medieval pre-Humanists, as
expressed in the famous allegorical frescoes of Buon Governo and Tyranny
painted by Ambrogio Lorenzetti around 1338 on the walls of the Council
Room of the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena. These paintings show two opposing
scenes within a single political theatre: the allegory of bad government
is dominated by a single fi gure — the Tyrant — whereas good government
shows a balance between the masculine fi gure of political Power and the
feminine fi gure of Justice. The honest citizens, when guided by power and
authority together, are united in Concord (symbolised by the rope which
links them to the two fi gures), and can thus contribute to the City ’ s prosperity,
as shown on another wall of the room.
These frescoes are a particularly striking example of the moment of selfrepresentation
essential to every government, whether the entity is a city, a
state, a political party or a company. Pierre Legendre has explored the crucial

role of this aesthetic dimension in all institutional constructs. 6 A representative
government implies that those governed can recognise themselves in it.
The same goes for the sphere of collective representation which labour law
has built up between private and public law. If the governed can no longer
recognise themselves in their government, they will be unable to trust it and
identify with its decisions. Politics will appear to be nothing but a ridiculous
posturing, which can at best elicit derision, while one bides one ’ s time. The
blistering humour which thrives under authoritarian regimes is a sign of
this, as the population ’ s way of expressing their defi ance of those who govern,
and as a way of creating invisible networks of solidarity. When a people
has been denied the right to form a political community freely, their poets
and musicians often represent a more powerful and long-standing focus
of collective identifi cation than do their political leaders (Liszt ’ s music, for
example, or Mahmoud Darwich ’ s poetry).
One of the most remarkable features of collective representation, understood
in this double legal and aesthetic sense, is that it institutes, or gives
legal existence to, a community of those governed. This is why ancient
Greek theatre was not a form of entertainment reserved for the wealthy, but
a civic ceremony which was integral to the development of democracy and
the primacy of the law. Louis Gernet has shown, in Jean-Pierre Vernant ’ s
words, that ‘ the true material of tragedy is the socio-political thought peculiar
to the City-state, in particular the legal thought that was being elaborated
at the time. ’ 7 Theatre, music and poetry reinforced the laws governing
the polis, and brought the public together through their experience of the
same imaginary representations. A similar process of bonding is achieved
by the various forms of collective representation. Every representative body
of employees creates a particular community, whether at the level of the
company or the business unit, and whether it is a group of managers or of
metallurgists. Unlike a mandate or power of attorney, by which those who
are represented institute their representatives, in collective representation it
is always the representatives who institute the represented body. 8 In other
words, this type of representation provides a form and a collective identity
for what was until then only an aggregate of individuals.
What knits together such communities are legal ties, that is, texts which
at once defi ne and organise the groupings. However, the ties take shape only

through other forms of social imaginary, which we can class as aesthetic.
This point should not be overlooked in examining the specifi c role of the
law in instituting solidarity between people. In general, the links between
law and technoscience are easy to grasp, for example when social law gives
legal force to groups ‘ objectively ’constituted by technological factors (for
instance, a group of employees exposed to ionising radiation), 9 or else
groups defi ned ‘ objectively ’by social scientists (for instance, ‘ young people
aged between 16 and 26 who live in deprived urban areas ’ ). 10 But the law
also plays a role in constituting ‘ subjective ’solidarity between, say, those
attending a rock concert or a concert of baroque music. When a young
graduate joins a fast-track stream of the civil service, this is not simply an
administrative act determined by an organisational rationale; it is also a
moment of initiation into a certain ethos, a certain type of ‘ confraternity ’
which, although symbolic, can have powerful effects in the way the State
functions in practice. Similarly, the legal qualifi cation of a ‘ young person
who lives in a deprived urban area ’is not simply a neutral label which
translates a supposed understanding of the causes of unemployment. It is
also the sign of a certain social group, which is a form of stigmatisation
and relegation to a sub-culture. ‘ Rational ’administrative bodies register
the symbolic effects of certain legal categories only unconsciously, and veil
their subjective dimension behind a fa ç ade of purely instrumental goals:
take, for example, some French acronyms for university courses and posts
at the bottom of the scale — ATER ( Attach éTemporaire d ’ Enseignement et
de Recherche), which sounds like àterre: fl oored, on the ground); or equally
the incomprehension which has greeted the poor take-up of the State benefi t
‘ Income from Active Solidarity ’( Revenu de Solidarit éActive), where those
eligible explain that they are ‘ capable of coping alone ’and do not want to
‘ be dependent on assitance from others ’ .
11
The aesthetic dimension of the law extends to how legal statements themselves
are formulated. The authority and stability of a rule will often depend
on its literary elegance. The articles of the French Civil Code are a case in point,
but the same goes for any work of legal doctrine, 12 since their force derives
in part from their stylistic qualities. French jurists still deploy their arguments
in two parts and sub-parts — a distant hangover from Scholasticism —
which is deemed to refl ect the balance and hence the fairness of their reasoning.
We may hardly be aware nowadays of the normative force of

aesthetic properties, but the reader of the famous opening sentence of the
Prooemium of Justinian ’ s Institutes senses this clearly: ‘ The imperial majesty
should be armed with laws as well as glorifi ed with arms, that there
may be good government in times both of war and of peace ’ . Kantorowicz
studied the singular fate of this couple armis decorata-legibus armata in the
sixteenth century, when in some of its restatements Letters replaced Laws
in order to stress that good government should be based on the arts as
much as on force. 13 In the eighteenth century, despite the rationalism of the
period, Vico methodically explored the links between laws and poetry. In
his words, ‘ [Scholars] agree that the fi rst poets were also the fi rst writers,
but they have failed to recognise the related fact that poetic language was
the fi rst language of nations and that it founded their fi rst religions and
their fi rst laws. ’ 14 To a modern mind, the affi nity between law and poetry
may seem incongruous, but it becomes clearer if we recall that the Ancient
Greek term ποίησις ( po í ê sis) meant creative activity, bringing forth something
new, and only secondarily poetry and poetics. 15 Through its aesthetic
force, poetry reconciles contraries and is both creative and organisatory.
It can therefore contribute to establishing or re-establishing harmony
between human beings.
This mode of thought was familiar to Japan, the fi rst country to assimilate
Western legal culture without abandoning its own traditions, and thus a
particularly interesting case. With the Meiji era a vast linguistic project was
launched to incorporate Western legal concepts while also reviving strictly
Japanese ones, which belonged to the imperial tradition. One of these concepts
was ‘ government ’ .
16
Under the shogunate, government by warriors ( bushis) was referred to
metonymically as bakufu 幕府. Originally, ‘ baku’ , 幕, referred to a piece
of material which surrounded the place ( ‘ fu’ , 府) where the ‘ shogun ’(the
general-in-chief) resided in the camp of campaigning armies, and so the fi rst
meaning of ‘ bakufu’was the headquarters of the military command. But
in the twelfth century it came to mean the power exercised by the Shogun
over his vassals, the great feudal lords. Different terms were used to refer
18 In Search of a Machine of Government

to the power of the Tenno 天 皇 (the king of the heavens, the most high),
whose function was different. By metonymy, again, rather than metaphor,
the terms Gosho or Chotei designated the imperial headquarters, the seat
of the Tenno. One could compare this with the papal government, called
the Holy See or the Apostiolic See. According to Canon 361 of the Code of
Canon Law in force today, ‘ the term Apostolic See or Holy See refers not
only to the Roman Pontiff but also to the State Secretariat, the Council for
the Public Affairs of the Church, and other institutes of the Roman Curia,
unless it is otherwise apparent from the nature of the matter or the context
of the words. ’The Roman pontiff himself is the ultimate seat of government
of the Church. This comparison should help us understand the terminology
adopted by Japanese jurists after the Meiji Restoration. Until the 1870s,
there was no consecrated translation of the word ‘ government ’ : the Tenno,
like the Pope, was infallible. His omnipotence did not rely on what the West,
following Weber, calls the monopoly of the legitimate use of force, but on
the infl uence he exercised over his subjects ’minds. Like the Pope, he did not
reign through soldiers but through souls, and while the Shogun dealt with
the reality of power, the Emperor organised poetry competitions.
The instigators of the Meiji Revolution attempted to reactivate this political
fi gure of the Tenno, while ensuring that the Emperor held real power.
This was, understandably, no easy task, and the concepts they mobilised to
achieve it can seem impenetrable to Western jurists. According to Article 1
of the Meiji Constitution, ‘ The Empire of Japan is reigned over by T ô chi
power, from a line of Emperors unbroken since eternity. ’One of the leading
drafters of this Constitution, Inoue Kowashi (1844 – 1895), explained that
the Chinese character ‘ T ô chi ’ originally meant the capacity to refl ect truth
like a mirror. Due to his celestial position, the Tenno can know and ordain
everything, bringing order to the world without violence despite his omnipotence.
Another drafter of the Constitution criticised the Western idea of
government in its original nautical sense, which in his view dehumanised
the population by treating it like an inanimate object. Choosing the concept
of ‘ t ô chi’to describe the role of the Emperor was also a response to this
criticism.
Translations of the term for ‘ government ’only stabilised in the 1880s,
with the notions of ‘ sei-ji ’and ‘ sei-fu ’ . ‘ Sei-ji ’ , 政 治, a term taken from
ancient Chinese texts, refers to the action of governing, and means ‘ politics ’
in China and Japan. But in the pre-Meiji era in Japan, it also meant being in
charge of the rites. ‘ Sei-fu ’ , 政 府, also a Chinese term, was used to translate
the organisation of government, and was hardly used in Japan before modernisation.
As we saw with Baku-fu, the word ‘ fu ’was often used to refer
both to the place of residence of the leader and his function. In the 1870s the
word ‘ sei-fu ’was adopted to translate ‘ government ’ , in order to stress the
fact that the emperor and his ‘ fu ’were leaders of the ‘ sei ’ ; that is, not only
of the political realm, but also of state rites.

II. THE MAN-MACHINE

With some rare exceptions, 17 those who regard government as solely an
instrument of domination of some groups over others tend not to perceive
its aesthetic and poetic dimension. The latter seems to have no place in
the rationalistic and mechanistic imaginary which has dominated political
philosophy from the advent of modernity until today. When political institutions
are regarded as machines, it is indeed diffi cult to understand the
pivotal role of aesthetics in the art of governing, but since government ’ s
spectacular aspect cannot be denied either, it is reduced to techniques of
manipulation and communication, and thus forced back into a mechanistic
paradigm. This paradigm, which is supposedly ‘ objective ’ , makes us
view people as though they were things, ‘ like “ particles ”which are under
the sway of forces of attraction, repulsion, etc, as in a magnetic fi eld ’ , in
Bourdieu ’ s words. 18 From this perspective, government is one huge machine
controlled by a play of forces, cogs, weights and counter-weights.
Hobbes in the mid-seventeenth century is certainly the thinker who
expressed this idea of government as a machine in its purest form, as from
the opening of his classic work of European legal thought, Leviathan.
19 In
the section which precedes and justifi es the contents of the book, and indeed
its very fi rst word, we fi nd the term ‘ nature ’ : ‘ Nature (the art whereby God
hath made and governs the world) is by the art of man, as in many other
things, so in this also imitated, that it can make an artifi cial animal. ’Hobbes
is neither the fi rst nor the last thinker to ground the law in nature, where
nature is the expression of a technique which God has devised and which
He oversees. Man, made in God ’ s image, can and should copy this technique,
and, in turn, use the mechanical arts to create artifi cial beings, more
precisely ‘ artifi cial animals ’or automata, which imitate a living being and
are endowed with movement. From the late Middle Ages to the industrial
era, automata were objects of such fascination that they attracted the best
watchmakers of Europe and involved remarkable technical prowess, as in
the group of three fi gures — the writer, the draughtsman and the woman
playing an instrument — created by Pierre and Henri Jaquet-Droz in 1775
(today displayed in the Neuch â tel museum).

20 cf L Mumford , Technics and Civilization ( New York City , Harcourt , Brace &Co , 1934 ) . 21 JO de La Mettrie , A Thomson(ed and tr), Machine Man and Other Writings ( Cambridge ,
Cambridge University Press 1996 ) .

Hobbes states:

For seeing life is but a motion of limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principal
part within, why may we not say that all automata (engines that move themselves
by springs and wheels as doth a watch) have an artifi cial life ?

‘ As doth a watch ’ : this object — the automaton par excellence— captured
the imagination of the West from the late Middle Ages to the industrial
era because it reproduced on a human scale what God the watchmaker
created. 20 Astronomical clocks could even be found hanging in cathedrals,
for example in Strasbourg. The whole of creation was represented as a vast
clockwork mechanism driven by a play of weights and energetics which
classical physics would attempt to explain.
Hobbes ’ s argument at this point takes a new direction. Man imitates God
by creating automata, but that is because he is himself an automaton, created
by the Great Watchmaker: ‘ For what is the heart, but a spring; and
the nerves, but so many strings; and the joints, but so many wheels, giving
motion to the whole body, such as was intended by the Artifi cer ? ’This
reversal of agency resembles the logic of those who argue today that the
human brain works like a computer because the computer is modelled on
certain faculties of the brain. What underlies the famous Treatise on the
Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common-wealth Ecclesiastical and Civil
(the subtitle of Leviathan) is thus not simply a metaphor, but a real physical
anthropology of the man-machine. This fi gure had precedents in the
sixteenth century, for example in Ambroise Par é ’ s medical works, and in the
eighteenth century a more radical version emerged with de la Mettrie, who
declared that ‘ we are like a watch which says, “ What! Was I made by that
stupid workman, I who can divide up time, who can indicate so precisely
the sun ’ s course, who can say out loud the hours which I indicate! No, that
is impossible ” . ’ 21
After establishing a continuum between man, animal and machine,
Hobbes takes one last step, to arrive at his conception of the state as an
automaton made by man in his own image:

Art goes yet further, imitating that rational and most excellent work of Nature,
man.

For by art is created that great Leviathan called a Commonwealth, or State
(in Latin, Civitas), which is but an artifi cial man, though of greater stature and
strength than the natural, for whose protection and defence it was intended; and
in which
22 In Search of a Machine of Government

— the sovereignty is an artifi cial soul, as giving life and motion to the whole
body;
— the magistrates and other offi cers of judicature and execution, artifi cial joints;
— reward and punishment (by which fastened to the seat of the sovereignty,
every joint and member is moved to perform his duty) are the nerves, that do
the same in the body natural;
— the wealth and riches of all the particular members are the strength;
— salus populi (the people ’ s safety) its business;
— counsellors, by whom all things needful for it to know are suggested unto it,
are the memory;
— equity and laws, an artifi cial reason and will; concord, health; sedition, sickness;
and civil war, death.

Lastly, the pacts and covenants, by which the parts of this body politic were at
fi rst made, set together, and united, resemble that fi at, or the Let us make man,
pronounced by God in the Creation.

In this seminal text, religion, law, science and technology are all summoned
to give form to a normative imaginary which is still largely ours today,
namely that of government as a machine.
However, European societies went further than placing astronomical
clocks in cathedrals, as images of God ’ s creation. In the medieval period,
they also put them on the outside, on belfries and church towers, introducing
a new organisation of working time, which followed the clock ’ s

The culmination of this new way of governing human beings is represented
by Taylorism. The industrial worker of Chaplin ’ s Modern Times is nothing
but a set of physical forces enslaved to the cadence of the production line. 23
His body is utterly dominated by the model of the clock, dear to Hobbes
and de La Mettrie. 24 ‘ Machine operators, ’Simone Weil observed,

do not reach the required cadence unless even their smallest gestures succeed one
another in an uninterrupted sequence and almost like the tick-tock of a clock,
without anything marking that one thing is fi nished and something else is beginning.
Workers are obliged to reproduce with their bodies this tick-tock, which is
so dreary and monotonous that one cannot bear to listen to it for long. 25

As an object of ‘ scientifi c organisation ’ , work is reduced to a succession
of simple and measurable gestures. Occupational qualifi cations and their
mysteries must dissolve into the transparent functioning of the factory. 26
Work is here reduced to its most basic expression, not; that of a beast of
burden. In the industrial-era factory, the worker was deprived of a truly
human experience of work, which consists of realising something one has
oneself conceived. 27
After this physical model of the clock, which encouraged a vision of
human beings as themselves machines, there appeared in the nineteenth
century the biological model of natural selection, which inspired Social
Darwinism and continues to take its toll in the form of neoliberalism and
the competition of all against all. To these fi gures, which are cumulative
rather than cancelling each other out, we can add ‘ programmable man ’ ,
produced by cybernetics and the information revolution. Its model is not the
clock, with its interplay of forces and cogs, but rather the computer, with
its digital processing of signals. The computer responds to programmes, not
laws. It embodies the externalisation of some of the faculties of the human
brain, and represents a new era in our relation to machines, as well as in the
content and organisation of work. 28
This reifi ed concept of work expresses a social imaginary typical of
modern times. Its potentially delusional dimension has been magnifi cently
described by Castoriadis:

To treat a person as a thing or as a purely mechanical system is not less but
more imaginary than claiming to see him as an owl; it represents an even deeper
dive into the imaginary. For not only is the real kinship between a man and
an owl incomparably greater than it is with a machine, but also no primitive
society ever applied the consequences of its assimilations of people with other
things as radically as modern industry does with its metaphor of the human
automaton. Primitive societies always seem to preserve a certain duplicity in
these assimilations, but modern society in its practice takes them literally, in
the most brutal ways. 29

Although this fascination for the technical rationalisation of work was
criticised by the most clear-sighted thinkers, 30 it was the Left ’ s ideological
backbone for over a century, and had this in common with the neoliberal
Right. Not only did the majority of the Left adhere to the imaginary
representation of the man-automaton, and the supposed techno-scientifi c

rationality of the organisation of work, but it also applauded the idea of
extending this model of corporate governance to the whole of society.
Lenin regarded Taylorism as ‘ an immense scientifi c progress ’ ,
31 and in his
view one could consider the Bolshevik Revolution to have achieved its ends
when ‘ the whole society [would] be nothing but a single offi ce, a single
workshop. ’ 32 Bruno Trentin describes the human being produced by this
ideology shared by the Left and the Right as ‘ a new subject, conscious of
the limits “ technology ”and the organisation of labour impose, and capable
of assuming them voluntarily; capable also, for that very reason, of being
in some sense more conscious and freer. ’ 33 One cannot help thinking here
of Ernst J ü nger ’ s depiction of the worker after the First World War, who
was heir to the industrial management of man tested out in the trenches,
and whose only freedom was total self-sacrifi ce on the altar of the party
or the market. 34 This shared imaginary helps explain the unholy union of
communism and capitalism which we have witnessed in China and in postenlargement
Europe, and it can also make sense of the general approval
given the idea of importing into the public sphere the management techniques
used in the business world.

III. FROM GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNANCE

The desire to apply the supposedly scientifi c methods of the organisation
of work beyond the factory to the whole of society has by no means disappeared
today, but the reference has changed. The physico-mechanical model
of the clock, 35 linked to the idea of the reign of the law, has been supplanted
by the cybernetic model of the computer. The organisation of work is no
longer conceived as a machine controlled by the play of weights and forces,
in which workers are no more than cogs, but as a programmable system
of interacting units adjusting automatically to signal inputs and feedback.
This model was welcomed across the political spectrum, and imported into

a doctrine which would certainly have been applauded by the brains behind
the Gosplan.
It was one of the founding fathers of cybernetics, Norbert Wiener, who
fi rst had the idea of projecting this mode of functioning onto society as a
whole. He described this in a work published in 1950 called Cybernetics
and Society, whose sub-title, ‘ The human use of human beings’ , already
spoke volumes:

It is my thesis that the physical functioning of the living individual and the operation
of some of the newer communication machines are precisely parallel in their
analogous attempts to control entropy through feedback. Both of them have sensory
receptors as one stage in their cycle of operation: that is, in both of them
there exists a special apparatus for collecting information from the outer world at
low energy levels, and for making it available in the operation of the individual
or of the machine. In both cases these external messages are not taken neat, but
through the internal transforming powers of the apparatus, whether it be alive or
dead. The information is then turned into a new form available for the further
stages of performance.

In both the animal and the machine this performance is made to be effective on the
outer world. In both of them, their performed action on the outer world, and not
merely their intended action, is reported back to the central regulatory apparatus.

This complex of behavior is ignored by the average man, and in particular does
not play the role that it should in our habitual analysis of society; for just as individual
physical responses may be seen from this point of view, so may the organic
responses of society itself.37 (emphasis added)

This text is particularly useful for understanding the transition from government
to governance (or rules to regulation) in the institutional vocabulary of
the last 30 years. Contrary to ‘ government ’ , which implies a law which must
be obeyed, ‘ governance ’rests on the capacity of human beings to adapt their
behaviour to changes in their environment, in order to survive.

Historically, the French term gouvernance appeared in the thirteenth century
to refer to the art of governing. It was subsequently transplanted into
English, and then taken back into French charged with a new meaning. 38
In its modern sense, it was fi rst used to challenge the power of senior managers,
through what would become the doctrine of corporate governance.
The famous economist Ronald Coase had already laid the theoretical bases

of this doctrine in a famous article of 1937 on the nature of the fi rm, 39 and
its principles were expounded in the Cadbury Report of 1992, 40 by the
OECD in 1998, 41 and then by the European Commission. 42 In France it
was imported via the Rapport Vi é not (1995), which was behind the French
reforms of company law adopted at the end of the 1990s. 43 Corporate governance
in practice made the fi rm ’ s fi nancial performance into the criterion
for management decisions, and adjusted the forms of organisation of
work to ‘ value creation ’for shareholders, with the result that calculations
of fi nancial interest overrode all other rationales.
By linking top managers ’pay to the company ’ s fi nancial performance,
corporate governance called a halt to the autonomisation of the power of
the ‘ techno-structure ’ , as John Galbraith called it. 44 The Fordist organisation
was a hierarchical, integrated structure, which obeyed a logic of technical
rationality. It prevailed during the post-war boom years, and provided
factory workers with economic security. Corporate governance, by contrast,
thinks in terms of networked units of value creation, 45 which obey the logics
of the information and communication technologies, and where a worker ’ s
motivation is supposed to spring from the maximisation of his or her fi nancial
interest.
Work has no place in this new conception of the company, for which
only shareholders and stakeholders exist. Employees are stakeholders, not
because they work or as workers (such terms are banished from the language
of governance), 46 but because they possess a ‘ human resource ’or a
‘ human capital ’ . To borrow an expression used by Augustin Berque in a
different context, the ‘ foreclusion of work ’ 47 has replaced the industrial
era ’ s ‘ reifi cation of work ’ . Under Taylorism, work was divided between a
small number of people paid to think and the vast mass of workers who

This division of labour disappears in the cybernetic universe of governance,
where all work is ‘ functioning ’ ,
48 more specifi cally the functioning of
a communication machine programmed to always optimise performance.
It is these real performances, measured quantitatively in terms of fi nancial
results, which have become the criterion of good governance, rather than
respect for the law.

***

The notion of governance in this sense was adopted at the end of the last
century by international economic organisations (the World Bank 49 and the
IMF), 50 who imposed this business model on ‘ developing ’countries fi rst
through structural adjustment plans, and later through poverty reduction
strategies. The ‘ good governance ’championed by these organisations works
out in practice as a drastic shrinkage of the state, particularly in the areas of
culture and welfare, and the burgeoning of the private sector and ‘ civil society
’ . As Joseph Stiglitz, the former Vice-President and Chief Economist of
the World Bank from 1997 to 2000 confessed, structural adjustment plans
were never anything other than forcing developing countries to serve the
fi nancial interests of the industrialised countries. 51
The notion of ‘ governance ’also overrun the vocabulary of the EU at about
the same time. 52 It cropped up in all sorts of contexts: the EU ’ s legal system
as a whole; its economic and taxation policies; its statistics; international
institutions; relations with developing counties; aviation; new technologies;
the environment; and more. The notion ’ s crowning triumph, whereby it
jumped to the top of the hierarchy of European legal instruments, was represented
by the coming into force of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination
and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, on 1 January 2013.
This was the Treaty which the then candidate for the French Presidency,
Fran ç ois Hollande, vowed never to ratify as it stood — which did not prevent
him doing just that as soon as he came to power. But this makes perfect
sense, because governance, implemented as programmes of self-adjustment
to received signals in real time, is incompatible with keeping one ’ s word.
From Government to Governance 29

More generally, the terms of ‘governance’ tend to replace those of
‘government’, 53 as Table 1below shows:

Where ‘ government ’relies on subordinating individuals, ‘ governance ’ , in
line with its cybernetic vision, relies on programming them. This shift was
already visible in the text by Norbert Wiener cited above, in the opposition
he drew between performed action and intended action. The subordinated
worker obeys the rules he is given, whereas the programmed worker reacts
to the information reaching him from his environment. This move from subordination
to programme is absolutely central to our contemporary representation
of human action. Unlike plans, which suppose the heteronomous
intervention of a planner, programmes are homeostatic and auto-referential
systems. This explains their success in biology, where genetic programmes
have put a salutary end to divine plans, and in management, as a way of getting
around the question of who governs. Today, the media do not explain
a politician ’ s or a political party ’ s policies in terms of their ideology or their
principles, but instead they talk about them being ‘ hard-wired ’to do something,
having it ‘ in their DNA ’ .

30 In Search of a Machine of Government

The myth of a being created by man in his own image to satisfy his needs
and desires is nothing new. But it is only in the West and in modern times
that this imaginary has inspired technology, from the construction of the
fi rst automata to the industrial universe represented by Fritz Lang or Charlie
Chaplin, and more recently the world of information technology. In an illuminating
book on these creatures made in the image of man, the historian
of technology Philippe Breton has sketched the fi liation from Pygmalion and
Galatea in Greek mythology, or the Golem in the Talmudic tradition, through
to contemporary computers and robots. 54 Leviathan is not mentioned, but
it would rightfully have a place in this lineage alongside the fi rst automata
and androids of the Renaissance. With it, everything is already in place:
legal rules are assimilated to the biological regulation of a ‘ political body ’ ,
and this ‘ body ’is itself reducible to a machine. The many offspring of this
machine of government could also be added to the list: the Jacobin Republic,
the monstrous machine of the totalitarian state, which massacres innocents,
like Frankenstein ’ s creature, and the nurturing fi gure of the welfare state,
which should satisfy all man ’ s needs. The youngest offspring would be the
decidedly contemporary fi gure of the pre-programmed homeostatic machine,
capable of self-regulation through feedback (in response to the ‘ nerves ’of this
machine-body, which are punishment and reward). The machine of government
has abandoned the model of the clock and adopted that of the computer,
an acephalous machine in which the locus of power is unidentifi able,
in which regulation replaces rules, and governance replaces government. The
digital revolution thus accompanies the revolution in law, in which an ideal of
governance by numbers tends increasingly to supplant government by laws.
Hobbes ’ s machine of government, modelled on the automaton, was ruled
by infl exible laws similar to Galileo ’ s laws of physics. Today, its cybernetic
equivalent is ruled not by laws but by programmes which ensure homeostasis 55
according to a self-regulatory mechanism similar to that of a biological
organism or a computer. The replacement of government by governance is
an expression of this new, cybernetic imaginary, and marks both a break
with the ideal of the law ’ s supremacy, and a continuity. A break, because law
loses its sovereign status and becomes simply an instrument for the realisation
of programmes; but also a continuity, because governance comes closest to
the ideal of a res publica protected from the arbitrariness of human will —
including the will of the majority, that is, democracy. As such, the consecration
of governance in the form of programming and programmes resonates
with another dream pursued by the West, that of socio-political harmony as a
calculable outcome. By focusing fi rst on these two elements of continuity, we
shall gain a better understanding of the dynamics and scope of governance by
numbers, as well as the inevitable failure of its proposed solutions.

The Fortunes of an Ideal:
Ruling by Law

‘ For wherever in a State the law is subservient and impotent, over that State
I see ruin impending; but wherever the law is lord over the rulers, and the rulers
are servants to the law, there I see salvation and all the blessings that the
gods bestow on States. ’

Plato, The Laws

I
T HAS OFTEN been argued that we need to consent to general and
abstract laws in order to be freed from bonds of personal dependence.
The most eloquent defendant of this ideal of rule by laws was
Rousseau, who, on the eve of the French and American Revolutions,
declared that: ‘ A free people obeys, but it does not serve, it has leaders, but
no masters; it obeys the laws, but it obeys only the laws, and it is due to the
strength of the laws that it is not forced to obey men. All the boundaries set
on the power of Magistrates in a Republic are fi xed only to protect from
their attacks the sacred precinct of the law. A people is free, whatever form
its government takes, when it sees in him who governs not a man but the
organ of the law. In a word, liberty always follows the fate of the laws, it
reigns or perishes with them. I know of nothing more certain. ’ 1 Scarcely
two decades later, this desire to be governed not by men but by laws was a
cornerstone of the fi rst modern Constitutions. In the pioneering example of
the State of Massachusetts (1780), the principle of the separation of powers
was introduced ‘ to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men ’ .
This end also inspired the Constitution of the French Republic, as informed
by Article 6 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen
(1789): ‘ Law is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right
to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation.
It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes. ’

The goal of ruling by laws was nothing new, and went back to the Greek
ideal of a state in which, as Plato wrote some 2,000 years before Rousseau,
those who govern are servants to the law:

And those who are termed ‘ magistrates ’I have now called ‘ ministers ’of the laws,
not for the sake of coining a new phrase, but in the belief that salvation, or ruin,
for a State hangs upon nothing so much as this. For wherever in a State the law is
subservient and impotent, over that State I see ruin impending; but wherever the
law is lord over the rulers, and the rulers are servants to the law, there I see salvation
and all the blessings that the gods bestow on States. ’ 2

The machine of government is the outcome, over many centuries, of the
sedimented interpretations of this Greek ideal. In order to understand our
current situation, in which law no longer rules because it is once again a
servant, this time serving the calculations of a machine, we must briefl y
review the main stages which have led us to this pass.

I. THE GREEK NOMOS

Some years ago, Marcel D é tienne rightly drew attention to our tendency
to mythologise our Greek roots, 3 but despite this justifi ed criticism, Greece
remains the place where a state fi rst realised the ideal of freely endowing
itself with laws. 4
Writing brought with it the possibility of making laws out of the rules of
coexistence which until then had circulated orally and were relatively unenforceable.
The founding laws of the Greek city states, which the great lawgivers
like Lycurgus and Solon had drawn up, were called Rhetra ( ῥήτρα) in
Sparta and Thesmos (θεσµ ός) in Athens. Rhetra is related to the verb for ‘ to
say ’ , and Thesmos to the verb ‘ to lay down ’ , ‘ to institute ’ . Nomos ( νόµ ος)
replaced Thesmos in the fi fth and sixth century BC, when Athens became
a democracy, and the laws imposed externally were replaced by laws with
which the citizens endowed themselves. Nomos was therefore associated
with the idea of the rule of law, which for the Greeks was synonymous with
democracy. 5 This was the ideal later upheld by Plato, that of a government
where ‘ Law became …supreme king over men instead of men being despots

over the laws ’ .
6 Nomos, from the verb nem ô , ‘ to share ’ , had previously

referred to a wide range of ritual and aesthetic rules. In its new guise, it
contained a tension between what is prescribed (an ideal order) and what is
described (customs observed in practice). This tension would appear to be
inherent in the very idea of human law. It is found in every historical period,
down to this very day.
Unlike the modern era, which ended up conceiving the political realm
exclusively in terms of power, the Greeks fi rst conceived it in terms of a just
order. In the sixth century BC, Greek political thought centred on the concept
of nomos, and the opposition between Eunomia ( Εὐνοµ ία), the ideal
of a well-ordered state, and Dysnomia ( Δυσνοµ ία), the rule of injustice and
excess. Each of these poles was embodied by a goddess, who presided over
the state. Equality between citizens gradually became integral to the idea
of a just order, and gave rise to the concept of Isonomia ( ἰσονοµ ία). 7 There
emerged in the ensuing century the idea that a state ’ s organisation is decided
by whoever governs it, and with that the goddess Eunomia developed gradually
into a concept. This was when ‘ cratistic ’constitutional terms emerged,
to differentiate states according to their form of power ( cratos): monarchy;
oligarchy; aristocracy; and democracy. In Christian Meier ’ s analysis, this
change in vocabulary implied a change in awareness: citizens discovered
that a just order is not something preordained on which one has no purchase,
but that they themselves can decide under what sort of rule they wish
to live. 8 From then onwards, Nomos took on the meaning of law in the
modern sense, that is, a law made by and for the citizens.
Since this was an entirely human law, the question of the source of its
binding effect — that is, the authority on which it drew, which secured it
obligatory character — was quick to emerge. Obviously, the question had
not arisen as long as laws were deemed to have a supernatural origin, but as
soon as they were recognised as a human invention, they lost their ultimate
surety and became open to change and relativity. Legal thought soon seized
upon the possibility — which was to haunt it throughout its history — that
higher, unwritten laws might exist, to which everyone must bow even if they
were contradicted by a human law-giver. This was the theme played out by
Antigone in her struggle against Creon, when she claimed that every human
being should receive due burial rites in the name of the ‘ unwritten, unwavering
laws of the gods ’ .
Today we no longer invoke the gods, but instead the sacred rights of the
human being, which underpin the right to resist oppression, and which,

carries the additional meaning of something ‘ said-between ’( inter-dit from the verb ‘ dire’ , to

shared meaning necessary for the creation of the social bond. See my Homo Juridicus. On the

since they are without statutory limitations, can prevent someone hiding
behind the laws in force in order to escape prosecution. This right was contained
in the American Declaration of Independence (1776), and reappeared
in Article 2 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen (1789),
thus forming part of today ’ s Constitutional laws in France.
We cannot help noticing, however, that the authors of the American Declaration
had no qualms about racial legislation, and had no intention of
conferring on their slaves the same rights of resistance as they did on themselves.
In other words, they gave legitimacy to legal rules which Article 7 of
the Rome Statute, which instituted the International Criminal Court, qualifi
es today as crimes against humanity. The regime of ‘ indig é nat’which the
French Republic applied in its colonies, and the eugenicist legislation which
remained in force in northern countries well after the Second World War,
encounter the same problem: that however eternal and sacred the human
laws laid down claim to be, they have no absolute authority. They may
contradict each other, and change, and their legitimacy is thus only relative.
It is well known that Montesquieu devoted a large part of his work to the
relativity of laws. But long before him, Herodotus, who can indisputably be
called the founding father of comparative law, made similar observations.
Throughout his wanderings, which provided him with the subject matter
of his Enquiry (his Histories), he noted down and passed judgement on the
different laws he encountered in the countries he travelled through. He came
to a ground-breaking conclusion: the very same people who habitually eat
their fathers ’dead bodies are repelled by the idea of burning them. And vice
versa. 9 Universally, the relativity of laws goes hand in hand, in human societies,
with the law ’ s anthropological function of inter-diction. 10
The idea of the relativity of laws was taken up by the Sophists in their
claim that the real laws, unlike these artifi cial ones, were the laws of nature.
In their wake, generations of philosophers and jurists attempted to measure
the legal order ’ s legitimacy against the order of nature. Nature, indeed — but
which nature ?Aristotle wrote that natural justice, in contradistinction to
justice in law, ‘ has the same validity in all places, and does not depend on
whether public opinion favours or rejects this value ’ .
11 But what has the
same validity everywhere, and does not depend on this or that opinion ?An
order of the world, that is, a cosmic order which is beyond human will and

controls it ?Or the nature of man, driving him to impose his views and to
seek to dominate his fellow men ?Are cosmic and human nature simply one
and the same, with the only really universal law being the law of the jungle ?
All these questions, which preoccupied the Greeks, are still with us today.
Those who believe in the existence of a ‘ spontaneous order of the market ’ ,
and who condemn in its name the ‘ mirage of social justice ’ , could repeat
Callicles ’ s criticism of laws in Plato ’ s Gorgias without changing a word:
‘ The pity is that the makers of the laws are the weaker sort of men, and the
more numerous. ’ 12 Human law, which is founded on equality, is thus the
weapon of the weak and the least capable, a weapon by means of which
they avoid being subjected to the stronger and more capable, and even manage
to subjugate these. Against such artifi ce, Callicles appeals to nature,
in a Darwinistic claim which was to have a notable legacy: ‘ but nature,
in my opinion, herself proclaims the fact that this is what justice has been
decided to be: that the superior rule the inferior and have a greater share
than they ’ .
13
We should be careful not to lump together the many later advocates of
this idea that the law of the strongest is true to the order of nature: Sade,
Nietzsche and Hitler cannot be confl ated, no more so than Adam Smith,
Darwin and Milton Friedman or Friedrich Hayek. However, this very range
shows how powerfully seductive it has been to project onto the legal order
what we think of as a ‘ natural ’order.
Sade, whose relation to the law has been the subject of several recent
books, 14 in a certain way took this projection to its limits in showing its
deadly potential. Sade wrote:

‘ If it is true that we resemble all the other productions of nature, if we have no
greater worth than they, why should we continue believing that we are driven by
different laws ?Are plants and animals acquainted with pity, social duties, brotherly
love ?And can we fi nd in nature any supreme law other than that of egoism ? ’ 15

There is no simple transition from philosophising in the boudoir to mass
butchery, yet this was a step the twentieth century took. Notably Hitler,
for whom ‘ natural resources, by virtue of an imminent law, belong to he
who conquers them [ … ] This is in accordance with the laws of nature [ … ]
The law of selection justifi es this unceasing struggle to enable the best to
survive. ’ 16 What Hitler added to Sade was the reference to Darwin, that

is, to a biological understanding of history. But Sade was not the fi rst to
describe the ‘ supreme law ’of nature as egoism, and to have proclaimed
that vices prosper and virtues suffer. This idea had already appeared in
Bernard Mandeville ’ s Fable of the Bees, a short philosophical tale published
in 1714 with the candid sub-title of ‘ Private vices, public benefi ts ’ . Louis
Dumont has stressed the importance of this text in the emergence and success
of contemporary economic ideology, 17 and more recently, Dany-Robert
Dufour has shown convincingly that Sade did no more than expose the
normative truth behind the idea that Kant ’ s categorical imperative could
simply be put aside, and self-love and the instrumentalisation of others
celebrated as the supreme law of a just order. 18

How did the Greeks attempt to resolve this crisis of legitimacy affecting
democratic law ?Now that the law was no longer ultimately guaranteed by
the gods, how could it avoid being enslaved to human passions and appetites,
and ultimately treated as a simple tool wielded by the strongest ?The
answers to this question varied from Socrates to Aristotle, but their common
ground was that they appealed to human reason as a substitute for
divine reason.
For Socrates, human reason understands law as a kind of pact. Not an
arbitrary, but a necessary pact, guaranteeing the survival of the state. Contrary
to Enlightenment philosophers and Rawls, Socrates did not postulate
an originary social contract, a sort of normative Big Bang from which
the law must have issued. He regarded respect for the law (even if it was
unjust) to be an obligation to be shouldered daily, a debt contracted simply
by virtue of living in a law-governed state. Without this respect, the state
would go to rack and ruin. And since Socrates formulates this principle
in the Crito, when he is deciding whether to submit to or fl ee the death
sentence which had been passed upon him, one can suggest that Socrates
valued this respect for the law above his own life. Having witnessed this
injustice, Plato can no longer adhere unreservedly to the ideal of government
by laws. For him, what reason dictates is that law is a necessary evil;
an imperfect, but indispensable instrument. There would be no need for
laws in an ideal world because it would be governed by a perfect science, a
royal science which along can reconcile the world of facts and that of ideas.
This ideal order is the subject matter of Plato ’ s The Statesman, which is also

a thorough-going critique of the imperfections of the law, in its inability to
grasp the diversity of individual cases and changing situations. Yet Plato ’ s
last treatise, the Laws, defends the sovereignty of the law. 19 For laws to
constitute a bridge between the world of ideas and the human world, he
argues, they must pursue the public interest, and be informed by the divine
model which is revealed to humans through the exercise of reason. The law
in this sense is what must reign in the city, whose leaders are no more than
its guardians, or even its slaves.
For Aristotle, by contrast, the authority of laws is based on the length of
time they have been in use by the state, which is a sign of their soundness.
Aristotle therefore refuses to assimilate the art of legislation to a technique
of government. Whereas technical rules may change for greater effi ciency,
the effi ciency of laws is measured by their stability. Aristotle wrote:

The example from the case of the [mechanical] arts is a mistake as to change the
practice of an art is a different thing from altering a law; for the law has no power
to compel obedience beside the force of custom, and custom only grows up over
a long lapse of time, so that lightly to change from the existing laws to other new
laws is to weaken the power of the law. 20

Aristotle would therefore condemn the idea of a ‘ machine of government ’ ,
insofar as the law cannot be equated with a technique.
The idea that the authority of laws depends on their stability still has its
advocates today; for example in a famous passage from the Preliminary
Address on the First Draft of the French Civil Code, Jean-Marie-Etienne
Portalis claimed (although at the time he was himself involved in recasting
the whole of French law) that one must

be abstemious in terms of novelty in matters of legislation because, while it is possible,
in a new institution, to calculate the advantages which theory may offer us,
it is not possible to know all the disadvantages that practice alone can uncover;
[ … ] that instead of changing laws, it is almost always more useful to present citizens
with new reasons for liking them. 21 (emphasis added)

This warning against enslaving laws to calculations of interest shows
a premonition of governance by numbers, at a time when, just after the
French Revolution, calculations of probability were fi rst being applied to
social issues. 22 Like Plato, and also Ulpian, 23 Portalis regarded the art of

24 Montesquieu uses this famous formula in Letter LXXIX of his Persian Letters, English

fi rst sentence is also worth noting: ‘ Most legislators have been men of limited intellect, owing
their elevated position to accident, and, in almost every case, guided by their prejudices and
fancies. ’ 25 Demosthenes , Against Timocrates, with an English translation by AT Murray

law-making as a kind of sacred task mediating between the world of ideas
and pure knowledge, on the one hand, and knowledge of the diversity
of temperaments and the strength of habit on the other. The fi rst realm
prompts us to ‘ calculate the advantages which theory may offer us ’ , whereas
the second consideration prompts us to ‘ to touch laws only with trembling
hands ’ .
24 The fear which should grip the legislator in the exercise of his
function was a theme already in Greek times. Demosthenes held up as an
example to the Athenians the Locrian custom in which ‘ if a man wishes to
propose a new law, he legislates with a halter round his neck. If the law is
accepted as good and benefi cial, the proposer departs with his life, but, if
not, the halter is drawn tight, and he is a dead man. ’ 25 What we see today is
quite the inverse, with legislative hyperactivity and the imperative of ‘ publish
or perish ’dictated to leaders and scholars alike.

***

Contemporary legal scholars tend to neglect what Greek thought contributes
to our conception of the law. At best they note the few pages on ‘ particular
justice ’in Aristotle ’ s Nicomachean Ethics, while abandoning all the
rest as political philosophy, and thus as anathema to legal inquiry. 26 Yet
even this extreme position cannot mask the extraordinary legal infl uence
of the Greek ideal of the rule of law in the history of Western institutions.
It is an ideal embodied in the very fi rst Constitutions and Declarations of
Rights drawn up in the late eighteenth century, which laid the basis for
legal orders which are still essentially ours today. So we cannot exclude the
heritage of Greek philosophy from the ‘ science of law ’because, as Harold
Berman rightly notes, legal positivism, natural law theory, the historical and
sociological schools (and, one should add, the ‘ Law and Economics ’doctrine)
cannot themselves explain the legal order, since they are all part of it.
‘ The history of the Western legal tradition, ’Berman writes, ‘ is in part the
tale of the emergence of, and the friction between, these different schools of

such-and-such a place and in such-and-such a time. ’ 27 Projecting back onto
our Greek heritage a ‘ pure ’conception of law, emptied of any political or
philosophical dimension, is in fact a legacy of Roman Law.

II. LEX IN ROMAN LAW

Although the word lex has certainly come down to us from Rome, or through
Latin, its etymology is the subject of much debate, and it has no equivalent
in other Indo-European languages. We can suppose that lex comes from
legere, which originally meant to pluck or gather, and later had the sense of
reading (harvesting the writing ’ s meaning). The great Roman Law specialist,
Andr éMagdelain, adopted this etymology, which has the additional advantage
of clarifying the difference between lex and ius.
28 The primary meaning
of the word ius in Latin is an authoritative formula. Ius comes from the verb
iurar meaning to swear, and ius dicere was the formula used to declare what
the law is, what one must comply with. 29 In Archaic Rome, ius was a body
of secret knowledge which circulated only between the pontiffs, because
they alone were guardians of mos, the customs of the ancestors. The Roman
civitas originally had two colleges of priests (sacred experts), the six augurs
responsible for interpreting the signs sent via birds by the gods to humans,
and the fi ve pontiffs ( pontifi ces). The pontiffs were responsible for assembling
and dismantling the bridges over the Tiber, and were thus in the fi rst
instance engineers, privy to the secrets of measurements and numbers. They
had the associated duty of announcing the public calendar, and their legal
expertise derived from their ability to tell dies fasti from dies nefasti. A third
college, of the twenty fetiales, emerged later. Its members were the living
memory of the treaties passed with neighbouring States, and they played a
similar role regarding the ius gentium (international law) as did the pontiffs
for the ius civilis. Despite their prestige (in their particular areas), the pontiffs,
augurs and fetials were simply consultants, who only pronounced on
what was asked of them, and had no potestas.
30 The pontiffs prescribed rites
(particularly sacrifi cial rites) to be performed in order to keep peace with

the gods and between men. The precepts delivered consequently covered
both the sacred ( fas) and the legal ( ius) domains, which were intertwined. 31
The pater familias who wished to know what ius to follow in a particular
circumstance, for example, what attitude and ritual words to observe in
carrying out a particular act (claiming or disposing of a good, making a formal
commitment, for instance), turned to the pontiffs, whose responsa took
oracular form, were never justifi ed by reasons, and were always formulated
in the imperative. The responsa were only valid for the case under consideration,
but the pontiffs kept a record, and in their case-based reasoning,
certain precedents, which they alone knew of, were endowed with authority.
Like the responsa, the leges were formulated in the imperative and likewise
belonged to the wider category of ius. But this ius was made public, promulgated
or displayed, or both at once. The ritual of reading the lex was a
condition of its validity, for royal edicts ( lex dicta), the consecration of temples
( lex templi), the publication of treaties (the lex of foedus), or other legal
acts. Only gradually did lex come to take on the meaning not of reading a
text, but of the text itself. And only after the founding of the Republic was
lex used to import the Greek nomos into Rome, together with its model of
a state ruled by laws and by the principle of isonomia. This legal and democratic
turning point was marked by the Law of the Twelve Tables, which
was composed in 450 BC, inscribed in bronze, and erected on the Forum
Romanum.
However, as Aldo Schiavone has shown, 32 grafting the Greek model
onto the Roman system never really worked because the rule of law had
to contend with the legal expertise of the pontiffs. The pontiffs became
the guardians of laws which they had not themselves proposed, but which
they scrutinised closely with their acknowledged hermeneutic powers. This
power passed into the hands of the (non-priestly) jurisconsults, after a freed
scribe, Gnaeus Flavius, divulged the pontiffs ’secret knowledge in the midfi
fth century BC, consisting of the law to be applied (statute law and case
law), the formulae to be used and the calendar to be respected to bring an
action before the judge. 33
This is how ius incorporated lex, and could emerge as a technique stripped
of its religious origins, and capable of being used in the most varied political
organisations. One could suggest that this technique had a digestive function.
It enabled the corpus iuris to digest a law ’ s content, whatever it was.
It was a technique wielded by experts who claimed to be neutral regarding
Lex in Roman Law 41

34 On the development of procedure, see PF Girard , Manuel de droit romain, 5th edn( Paris ,
Rousseau , 1911 ) 971ff . 35 Girard, Manuel de droit romain (n 34) 44. 36 Quoted by F ö gen (who takes this example from the Digest) (n 33) 175.

its content and to apply it under rigorously codifi ed conditions. The law
could give rise to an individual right only if the plaintiff was granted an
action, and this was done by complying with certain formulae approved by
the judge. 34
The formulae, which originated in a typology of cases abstracted from
their factual contexts, were a kind of social algebra, and the real keys to
the law. Girard observed that your average Roman would have felt just as
much at a loss attempting to apply the Twelve Tables to a concrete situation
as we feel today when faced with a set of log tables. 35 However, despite its
relevance, we should not be tempted to project back onto the past our contemporary
distinction between form and content. Not only did the Romans
have no algebra, but above all Roman law did not make the same clear-cut
distinction which modern legal systems make between substantive law and
procedural rules. Ius still confl ated them: it endowed the subject with a right
to bring an action in a particular case. Respecting the forms accompanying
each type of case was necessary for the performance of this ritual, even if
this process also laid the groundwork for a technical conception of law as a
pure form capable of adapting to any content whatsoever.
The formulae obeyed strict compositional principles. Their structure
could be divided into essential parts (which were specifi c to the type of
action) and ancillary parts (dependent on the concrete characteristics of
each case). The principle elements were the judge ’ s nominatio, the demonstratio
(a clause stating the facts from which the claim arose), the intentio
(the plaintiff ’ s statement of the claim or cause of action), the adjudicatio
(which gave the judge the power to transfer property, in actions for division
of common property) and the condemnatio (the instruction to the judge to
make a decision). A very simple example of a formula, comprising only the
three essential clauses of an action, looked like this: 36

[NOMINATIO] So-and-so must be judge. [INTENTIO] If it is proven that
A (the plaintiff) entrusted for safekeeping a silver table to B, and through the
perfi dy of B the table was not returned, [CONDEMNATIO] you, judge, must
condemn B to pay to A the sum which the object is worth. If it is not proven, you
must acquit him.

Litigants were obliged to use the set formulae, but the praetor could change
these to extend their scope and include situations which had not been foreseen
originally. This he did by adding a parameter which separated the precedents
from the case under consideration. For example, he could invoke the
notion of good faith ( bona fi des) if the custodian had a good reason for not

returning the table. Or he could change the person, in order to grant the
ususfructuary (U) the actio civilis legis Aquili æ which was initially granted
the owner (O) of something damaged by a third party. Thus U became
admissible instead of O, giving rise to a new formula. Another method was
to introduce a fi ctional element by behaving as though one of the formula ’ s
conditions had been fulfi lled. This gave rise to an actio fi ctiti æ of the following
sort:

So and so should be appointed judge. The theme of the trial is that A (the plaintiff)
entrusted a silver table to S, the slave of B. You, judge, must say what S — were he
free — must give to A or perform for him on the basis of good faith, and sentence
B in favour of A.

In this type of system, an individual right was a right to an action in the
procedural sense of the term: without a formula corresponding to the matter
under dispute, no right could be claimed. To use a concept coined in a
completely different context by Louis Dumont, 37 that of ‘ the encompassing
of the contrary ’ , Roman law came into being when ius encompassed lex,
and produced an extraordinarily successful paradigm, namely a legal order
which was at once binding on those who governed and a tool in their hands.
It was binding because it gave autonomy to the legal form and endowed
those governed with enforceable individual rights; and it was a tool the powerful
could wield because, unlike religious or scientifi c law, human law gives
normative force to the human will and can be shaped and transformed by it.
This paradigm certainly belongs to rule by laws, but unlike the Greek
original, it cannot be identifi ed with any particular political regime. Once
the law becomes a technique of government, it can function indifferently
in a monarchy, an oligarchy or a democracy. Thus Pope Gregory VII, in
the late eleventh century, could seize on this technique drawn from historical
Roman Law when — as vicarius Christi (and not simply vicar of Saint
Peter) — he claimed to be the living source of laws which were binding
throughout Christendom.

Pierre Legendre 39 and Harold Berman 40 have all highlighted its medieval origins
and its debt to the rediscovery of Roman law hybridised with canon law.
What Berman has called the Gregorian Revolution occurred in the twelfth
to thirteenth centuries, with its fi rst moment in 1075, when Pope Gregory
VII proclaimed in his Dictatus papae: a) the divine source of the authority of
the Church and the Pope; b) Papal supremacy over the whole Church; c) the
Pope ’ s power to make new laws; d) the Pope ’ s supreme judicial authority;
e) his independence from all temporal power; and f) his superior authority. 41
The papacy had been ‘ the abstract continuation of Roman government
in the West ’since the fall of the Empire, as Elie Faure puts it. 42 Since the
Western Church was the bridge between Roman imperial institutions and
feudal ones, 43 it could assert itself as an autonomous transnational entity
with a separate legal personality, independent of any imperial, royal or
feudal power.
A new conception of legal systems emerged with this revolution, infl uenced
by the distinction between temporal power and spiritual authority.
Gregory VII ’ s claim to sovereignty over the government of the Church and
the spiritual life of Christians uncoupled the previous intertwining of spiritual
and temporal, and paved the way for recognition of temporal power,
and for the rise of the modern state. Yet it would be inexact to think of the
Holy See as itself the fi rst modern state. Unlike state power, its authority had
no territorial limits, and was restricted to the salvation of the children of
God (and hence, originally at least, to the personal status of individuals). In
other words, it reigned over only a certain part of human life, the rest being
in the hands of secular powers. These powers themselves adopted the model
of government forged by Pope Gregory: a sovereign judge and legislator
whom all must obey, and whose power transcends the generations.
In this new model of government, the law was not simply an instrument
of sovereign power, but actually its constitutive element. 44 Bracton, in the
thirteenth century, was already claiming that ‘ The king must not be under
man but under God and under the law, because the law makes the king,
for there is no rex wherever will rules rather than lex’ .
45 This means that it

is not because the will of the ruler is sovereign that it is the source of law.
On the contrary, it is because it is the source of the law that this will is sovereign.
The ruler cannot break the law without disqualifying his own sovereignty.
Mozart put this theme to music in his opera Il Seraglio: although the
Pasha Selim Bassa desires the beautiful Konstanze and has her at his mercy,
he cannot use force against her without thereby destroying his own position
as sovereign. 46
The articulation between laws ( la loi) and the objective order of the law
( le Droit), which was already present in the Roman lex, was reworked
after the Gregorian Revolution and gave rise to what since the nineteenth
century has been called the Rule of Law ( l ’ É tat de droit). Over the last
200 years, this institutional construct has spearheaded the West ’ s ‘ civilising
mission ’abroad, in its successive guises of colonisation, development policies
and globalisation. However, it was fi rst exported much earlier, in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when jurists serving the temporal power of
princes adopted the model of government invented for the spiritual order by
Gregory VII. That is how the fi rst modern states emerged, beginning (in
chronological order) with England and France. This history is well known,
but one should not forget that the two major legal cultures of the West —
common law (in England and then America), and continental law, or
Romano-canonic law on Continental Europe — have this origin in common.

IV. COMMON LAW AND CONTINENTAL LAW

Again, contrary to certain received ideas, the legal culture of common law
comes closest to that of Ancient Rome. It took shape following the Norman
invasion of 1066, when William the Conqueror preserved the customary
law of the Anglo-Saxon inhabitants (using a legal strategy shared by many
colonising forces), but also imported the Norman laws in force at the time
for use by the new masters of the kingdom. The Curia regis used the original
language of this legislation ( ‘ Law French ’ ). William ’ s successors, and
particularly Henry II (1133 – 89), set up legal institutions in England which
were heavily infl uenced by Gregorian innovations. For example, in the work
of the great jurist Bracton ( c 1210 – 68), the King of England is explicitly
assimilated to the Pope, subject to no one but God, and called ‘ vicarius
Christi.’ ‘ For as long as he metes out justice ’ , said Bracton, ‘ he is the vicar
of the eternal King ’ .
47 Unlike what occurred in France, the monarch ’ s
Common Law and Continental Law 45

normative power was thus initially rooted in his role as a judge. 48 The much
sought-after access to the royal court was limited by a system of specifi c
actions comparable in all respects to the Roman actiones. One ’ s case could
be heard there only if one obtained an ordinance from the King ’ s Chancellor
(the Royal writ or bref, a short written order, from the Latin breve), or — in
a later version — if one obtained an authorisation from the judge himself
(actions on the case or super casum). Each type of action corresponded
to a particular type of case and had to comply with forms — the ‘ forms of
action ’ — which determined the procedure to be followed (the words to be
used; the modes of proof and of court appearance; the modes of judgment,
etc). As the adage ‘ Remedies precede rights ’shows, a right was only recognised
if there existed a specifi c action (a remedy) which corresponded to the
case in hand. The progress of law thus depended, as it did in the Roman
period, on the recognition of new cases which could give rise to an action,
like new shoots grafted onto the old stock of cases accepted in the past. The
rule that there is only one ‘ form of action ’for each cause of action remained
in force until 1854.
The law was thus identifi ed with the authority of precedents. The grounds
for judgement — the ratio decidendi— were binding on judges when confronted
with similar cases in the future (but any other considerations, or
obiter dictum, which were not essential to the decision, were not binding).
The judge, just like the Roman praetor, could innovate by admitting new distinctions,
from which a new case and a new rule could emerge. The law was
thus fi rst and foremost case law (in French, la juris-prudence), expressing
the prudence and the immemorial wisdom of the judge. But the sovereign —
the monarch, or equally the people represented by Parliament — could also
make the law. This statute law was binding on judges, but since in their
decision-making they fi ltered it through the common law, or rather incorporated
and absorbed it into the latter, Parliament had to practise a certain
casuistry in order to foresee how its intentions might be distorted or
bypassed. This is why common law jurists have such diffi culty accepting
that the succinctly polished statements of principle which constitute the very
backbone of continental law have legal force. Tocqueville summarised the
difference in mentality between the common law and the Continental jurist
in a few incisive traits ‘ The English and American lawmen [ l é gistes] investigate
what has been done; the French lawmen inquire into what one must
have intended to do; the former looks for rulings, the latter, for reasons. ’ 49

On the persistence of this attitude, which dictates that the judge may not go beyond the text of
the law to inquire into what the lawmakers may have had in mind, see RA Katzmann , Judging

The common law ’ s embedding in casuistry explains why it resembles
a network rather than a pyramid. Its structural traits emerge inductively,
through the actions of individuals, and not deductively, from the general
interest incarnated by the State. There is thus not really any place in common
law systems for what continental law calls the Law [ le Droit], in the
sense of a national legal system identifi ed with a state and a territory. In
Continental languages, the distinction between ius and lex in Roman law is
still operative in the difference between Droit and loi in French, and Recht
and Gesetz in German, but with certain shifts in meaning. French Droit
was coined in the medieval period from the Latin directum. It differs in two
respects from Roman ius: fi rst, there is the additional idea of rectitude and
direction, of that which orientates human life in time, and prescribes a path
to be followed. Secondly, this path is not simply the procedural route by
which one gains access to the law — that is, to recognition of an individual
subjective right ( un droit) — but it is also the direction which a whole society
decides to take ( le Droit, capital ‘ D ’ ). These two sides of the notion of
droit— le droit and le Droit— are, of course, intimately linked. It is because
the individual is within a shared normative framework that he or she can be
a legal subject ( un sujet de droit) and have recourse to the law. This particular
interconnection between the individual and society is not only lexicalised
in French but in all Continental European languages: Recht, diritto, derecho,
etc. It implies that the individual cannot be considered independently
of the society in which he or she is a subject, in the sense both of sub-jected,
‘ thrown under ’( sub-jectum), and of a speaking subject, a bearer of rights
and freedoms. This sub-jection of individual identity in a shared whole is
also implied in the French term é tat. An individual ’ s é tat civil— which could
be translated as ‘ personal status ’ — communicates with the notion of É tat
(capital ‘ É ’ ), the state, which guarantees this status; and also with the Etat
social, the social state, which extends guarantees to the individual ’ s
working life.
These interconnected meanings (around ‘ droit and ‘ é tat’ ) do not exist in
the English language. Admittedly, ‘ right ’comes from Ius, from the same root
as Recht or droit, but it has the meaning of an individual subjective right;
there is no equivalent of Droit with a capital ‘ D ’ , the order which underpins
and on which depend les droits with a small ‘ d ’( ‘ rights ’ ). The term ‘ law ’ ,
which is derived from the Old Norse lag meaning what is placed, fi xed 50—
similar in this to the German Gesetz and Latin lex— combines the senses

of the French la loi and le Droit, which are thus inadequately rendered in
English by ‘ law ’(although this is its standard translation). If we take Hegel ’ s
Rechtsphilosophie, for example, the English translations show the extent of
this dilemma: variously, the Philosophy of Law or, most obscurely for an
English reader, the Philosophy of Right.51
Beyond these translation problems lies the issue of the law of language. 52
The system of common law has been adopted by many countries, and it is
not attached to any particular one because it retains something of the universalising
ambition and the imperial pretensions of ius civilis, from which
our term civilisation comes. By contrast, in the system of continental law,
the law as Droit (capital ‘ D ’ ) is linked to the idea of the state and of territorial
limits: one expects the term to be accompanied by an adjective such as
‘ German ’ , ‘ Belgian ’ , ‘ Italian ’ , etc. ‘ The Rule of Law ’stands alone, requiring
no further qualifi cation, whereas its German equivalent, Rechtsstaat, supposes
the fi gure of the state. 53
The aspiration to universality which is contained in the very expression
‘ rule of law ’determined its translation into French in the Preamble to
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) as r é gime de droit (an
expression otherwise unfamiliar to the French ear): ‘ it is essential, if man is
not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against
tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule
of law [ par un r é gime de droit]. ’Where the English has a defi nite article, the
rule of law, implying the dream of a law embracing all the peoples of the
earth, the French has the indefi nite article, un r é gime de droit, and hence
the suggestion of a multiplicity of legal orders. This example alone shows
the weighty political stakes involved in the issue of working languages in
university research and in the drafting of laws at international level. Working
in a single language inevitably means thinking along the lines of the legal
culture it transports. This is particularly true of European law, where the
gradual adoption of English as the only working language has gone together
with abandoning the idea of a territorially defi ned political entity.
However real these differences may be, they should not be over-emphasised.
Were comparative law to broaden its scope, these two sides of the same

Western legal tradition might in fact prove closer and more unifi ed than
they appear today, in comparison with the normative systems of other
cultures. And indeed, a closer look shows us that although the architecture
of common law may be very different from that of continental law,
functionally they are very close. The difference between common law
(in the narrow sense) and equity — one of the pillars of this architecture — is
of about the same importance for English jurists as that between private
and public law for Continental ones. Equity echoes aequum, which was
used by Roman praetors to temper the infl exibility of the formulae of ius,
and to prevent their mechanical observance from generating injustice, 54 as
embodied in the proverb summum ius, summa iniuria.55 Equity had a similar
function in countering the rigidity of the Westminster Courts, and the
injustices this gave rise to. The victims of these injustices appealed to the
sense of equity of the King, who delegated the investigation of their claims
to his Chancellor, who was also his confessor and the ‘ guardian of the King ’ s
conscience ’ . The development of this new branch of law within the Court
of Chancery as from the fi fteenth century could have led the British legal
system towards the Continental model, with sovereignty vested in the king
rather than in the authority of parliament. But history did not take that
path, and indeed equity fi nally absorbed common law in the seventeenth
century, as an antidote to its own defi ciencies. The Introduction to Hobbes ’ s
Leviathan states that ‘ Equity and laws are an artifi cial reason and will, ’thus
establishing both their difference and their complementarity. Equity played
a similar role in the common law system as general legal principles do in
continental law, allowing a judge to interpret a technical rule, which may be
a source of injustice, in the light of a principle which transcends and corrects
its unjust effects. This complementarity between common law and equity, as
between the articles of Continental Codes and the principles by which one
can interpret them, shows that in neither system can the law be lastingly
divorced from considerations of justice. One could even claim that law ’ s
effectiveness as a technique depends on its fulfi lling the criteria of justice
of a particular society at a particular time. Those who claim the contrary
revert to a dogmatic defi nition of the law, which may well correspond to the
mechanistic imaginary of the West, but has never secured itself historically
for any length of time.
Continental law and common law are thus two branches of a single Western
legal tradition, as Harold Berman has described. 56 Its principal characteristic
is to have established law as an autonomous sphere, separate both

from politics and from religion. In the other civilisations of the book, legal
interpretation necessarily defers to Revealed Scripture, that is, to a text
which is the foundation of the legal order and of its legitimacy. By contrast,
the Gregorian Revolution separated law from theology, and the secular
states which were founded in its wake reaffi rmed this autonomy of the legal
sphere. Thereafter, the law developed as a technique, and was entrusted to
experts who had no need to inquire into the reason of the law.

V. THE WESTERN LEGAL TRADITION

Accursius ( c 1182 – 1260), who pioneered the teaching of law at university,
was already defending what is today the widely held purely technicist and
self-referential conception of the law when he dismissed the question of
whether the jurist should study theology with the reply ‘ Everything can be
found in the corpus of the Law ’ .
57 Today, jurists still tend to dismiss the
question of the ratio legis, and to see themselves as plain and simple technicians
who supervise the complicated system of conduits in which claims and
counter-claims circulate. The rationale and legitimacy of the laws they study
can be left to others.
But the issue would not go away. In the modern period, before the natural
sciences became the paradigm for the science of law, it was theologians
and philosophers who examined this question spurned by jurists. In Catholic
lands, the key actors were the School of Salamanca and the work of
Francisco Suarez. In the wake of the Counter-Reformation, Suarez developed
a general theory of laws in his Treatise On Laws and God the Lawgiver.
In Protestant lands, Hobbes ’ s Leviathan attempted to ‘ establish the art of
government as knowledge of nature ’ .
58 This direction was pursued further
by the Enlightenment philosophers, especially Locke in England, and
Montesquieu and Rousseau in France. As from the nineteenth century,
biology and the nascent social sciences became the fi elds in which scholars
hoped to fi nd the natural foundations of government. 59 Today it is economics,
and so pervasively that the Law and Economics doctrine has become the
standard paradigm for the science of law in the United States. 60
By separating law from theology, the Gregorian Revolution created a
space for political theologies, or secular religions, to develop. Their common
feature was that they subjected the legal order to the normative force
of certain ideas. They thus laid the groundwork for modernity in the West,
50 The Fortunes of an Ideal: Ruling by Law

perceive by vision). On the passage from idol to idea, see M Horkheimerand T Adorno ,

( Redwood City , Stanford University Press , 2002 ) . 62 R Lenoble , Histoire de l ’ id é e de nature ( Paris , Albin Michel , 1969 ) 227 . 63 This is what Augustin Berque calls ‘ TOM ’(as in ‘ lobo tomy ’ ), an acronym for ‘ Modern
Western Topos ’( Topos Occidental Moderne). See Po é tique de la Terre. Histoire naturelle et
histoire humaine, essai de m é sologie ( Paris , Belin , 2014 ) 35ff . The critique of the subject – object
dichotomy has been a minor, but longstanding and tenacious, theme in the human sciences,
from Vico to Dilthey and Gadamer. It is essential for understanding the symbolism specifi c to
human beings. 64 J-P Vernant , ‘ Remarques sur les formes et les limites de la pens é e technique chez les Grecs ’

with its idolisation of ideas, 61 and attempts to fashion society in their image.
One might think of tracing this omnipotence of ideas back to Plato, and it
is true that Platonism has always haunted the sciences, not least mathematics.
But whereas Plato ’ s refl ections on the cosmic order aimed at fi nding a
place for the human being within it, modernity aimed at quite the reverse, at
fashioning a human order in the image of its own theories. Robert Lenoble
has described the break between the Greek representation of Nature and
our own in the following terms:

For a Christian, Nature is not eternal: God cast it into being when He wanted to,
and He will spirit it away at the Last Judgment as though it were simply a huge
stage-set. It is not all there is, but simply something in the hands of God. When
humankind thus thinks of itself not as in Nature, but as facing nature, it will
apprehend its destiny as independent of the history of the world. And a day will
come when humankind will dare to declare that Nature, a machine in the hands of
God, is itself only a machine, whose levers may be handled also by man. 62

So it is our belief in the Biblical narrative of the Creation — secularised as
the ‘ Big Bang theory ’ — that separates our vision of nature from that of the
Greeks. In common with many non-Western cultures, the Greeks viewed
nature as eternal, subject to a cyclical and not a linear time. It was the object
of religious contemplation, not of active exploitation. For the Moderns, by
contrast, knowledge of nature was primarily a means to access its resources.
The Judeo-Christian belief that nature, or the physical world, was an emanation
of God ’ s mind and corresponded to His designs, brought with it
the subject/object dichotomy which has so powerfully shaped our scientifi c
representation of the world. 63 It led to the Cartesian ambition of becoming
‘ master and possessor of nature ’ , and fashioning the world in our image, by
appropriating for our own use the God-given laws inscribed there.
This shift in the role of knowledge of the world, from contemplation
to transformation, brought with it a change in the status of technology.
In Ancient Greece, technology never got further than ‘ a system of traditional
recipes and practical skills ’ ,
64 whereas from the seventeenth century
The Western Legal Tradition 51

onwards it became both the means of putting knowledge into practice, and
the primary justifi cation for pursuit of knowledge. A similar change took
place at the same time in the realm of law, as in Hobbes ’ s conception of
the law as a vast machine in which jurists are one of the ‘ artifi cial joints ’
(or rather, in today ’ s vocabulary, the technicians or maintenance team).
Legal technique embodied, and also challenged, the ideas which supposedly
governed the world at the time. These ideas were treated as idols, images
to which were attributed powers similar to the gods they represented. The
King, the nation, the fatherland, race, class, genes, the market and globalisation
are some such fetish words, and are meant to disclose a natural order
and allow us to press it into our service. According to this logic, the laws in
force should be the refl ection of the revealed truth of these ideas.
But we should not ourselves succumb to the idolatry of ideas, by treating
them as equivalent and interchangeable expressions of an ‘ idea of ideas ’
which would be called ‘ political theology ’or ‘ dogmatics ’ . All these notions
serve to link the human order to the natural order, but they are so wideranging
that ‘ nature ’seems to cover almost anything. The laws of nature
according to Aristotle, Cicero, or Rousseau are not the same as those for
Callicles or Sade.
When examining how these different ideas situate law, we shall be asking
whether or not they allow for an autonomous legal order. One of the
characteristics of twentieth-century totalitarianisms is precisely that they
obliterated an autonomous realm for the law, under the sway of scientism.
The conviction that science can answer the question of the meaning and
orientation of human life reduces the law to the role of a simple technique of
power, which can thus lay no claim to an independent realm. Our twentiethcentury
historical experience should remind us that the autonomy of the
legal form, and government by laws, cannot be taken for granted as timeless
and universal achievements, and that they have already come under heavy
fi re within the Western world itself.

Other Perspectives on Law

A wise sovereign changes the laws according to the demands of the times, and
adapts the rites to the development of morals. Clothes and utensils must
be adapted to the use to which they are put, just as legislation must be
appropriate to the society. 1

EVERY CIVILISATION UNTHINKINGLY endows its own categories
of thought with a universality they never have. Westerners are particularly
prone to this tendency because they have enjoyed three centuries
of dominating others thanks to their techno-scientifi c prowess. This
period is coming to a close, and they must now contend with other ways of
conceiving how human societies should be organised. This is no easy task
for some, as the return of the most primitive biologism attests and, relatedly,
the eclipse of comparative cultural studies among the research priorities of
the human sciences. As though exploring the ‘ neurological bases of religious
belief’ could substitute for an understanding of other systems of thought
(if only with a view to understanding the specifi city of our own)! This kind
of escapism, which is intimately entwined with the founding dogmas of the
West, makes any real universalism unattainable. Universalism does not mean
fi ltering the whole world through our own concepts, but rather fi ltering our
concepts through those of other civilisations. 2 It would be judicious, to say
the least, to pay some attention to how the emerging continents, which have
assimilated Western culture without abandoning their own, view the world
and conceive its organisation. We could learn from this how to identify the
real bonds and discrepancies between the different legal traditions facing
globalisation today.
For there is nothing universal about conceiving a natural or social order
in terms of laws. To show this, rather than undertaking a world tour of different
civilisations, this chapter will simply consider two very different but
complementary cases: sub-Saharan Africa and China. The example from
Ritualism 53

3 On the place of rites in Confucian thought and its tradition, see A Cheng , Histoire de la
pensé e chinoise ( Paris , Le Seuil , 1997 ) . 4 See L Vandermeersch ‘ Ritualisme et juridisme ’in É tudes sinologiques ( Paris , PUF , 1994 )
209 – 20 . 5 The Book of Rites (Li Ji): English-Chinese Version, tr J Legge (CreateSpace Independent
Publishing Platform, 2013).

Africa is particularly revealing, because laws arrived there only with colonisation,
and remained alien to African thought systems. We shall spend
longer, however, on the case of China because the idea of governing through
laws actually emerged there at roughly the same time as it did in Ancient
Rome, but in a different form. In both cases, governing by laws interrupted a
social order regulated by rites. We shall therefore start with a brief reminder
of what a ritual order is, and how it differs from a legal one.

I. RITUALISM

Ritualism is undoubtedly the oldest way of organising social relations, and
it was for a long time the most widespread. The role of rites in African
societies has been extensively studied by anthropologists, who have shown
how they enable the visible world to be harmonised with invisible forces.
However, these thought systems are diffi cult to characterise in general terms
because of their variety (also linguistically) and their oral mode of transmission.
Since Chinese ritualism is more unifi ed, and has been codifi ed in
writing, 3 it is an easier corpus to summarise, especially since it shares some
common ground with European-style legal systems. 4
Ritualism prescribes the ways of behaving appropriate to the full range
of inter-personal relations in a society, starting with the essential ones —
father – son, sovereign – subject, husband – wife, older – younger, colleague –
companion. From these are derived the rites to be observed in all other types
of relation, from the most local bonds (neighbourhood, school) to the most
distant (the nation, humanity as a whole). According to The Book of Rites:

He who sets great store by rites and who observes them is called an orderly person;
he who, on the contrary, ignores them and does not observe them is called
a man without rules. [Rites] are the consequence of respect and modesty; when
observed in the temple of one ’ s ancestors, it is respect; when observed at court,
the higher-ranking people and those who are more lowly have their respective
places; if observed in the home, there is love between father and son, and harmony
between older and younger; if observed in one ’ s village, there is a distinction
between the elders and those who are younger. 5

As the life of this ‘ orderly person ‘shows, rules do not have the same sense
in a ritual and in a legal order. In a society governed by laws, rules have
an objective, external existence with respect to the individual. In ritualism,

‘ La constitutionnalisation de la responsabilit écivile ’ , Cahiers du Conseil constitutionnel 31 ;
B Girard , Responsabilit écivile extracontractuelle et droits fondamentaux ( Paris , LGDJ , 2015 ) . 11 According to Confucius, ‘ when the people live in harmony through rites, it is the feeling
of face ( chi) which makes the rule prevail ’(Lunyu, Ch 2, Weizheng, quoted by Vandermeersch
‘ Ritualisme et juridisme ’(n 4) 218).

they are internalised ways of behaving. The Confucian tradition on which
ritualism is based depends on individuals ’work of ascesis in ‘ overcoming
their ego’. 6 Each person must internalise the primacy of society over the
individual in his handling of human relations; and harmony results from
the principle of allotted positions, to which the individual ’ s behaviour must
correspond. 7 This primacy of form over content and of society over individuals
explains why ritualism is based on duties and not on individual
rights. On this issue, L é on Vandermeersch notes that the single French term
‘ droit’refers both to ‘ subjective ’rights and to the ‘ objective ’system of laws
( le Droit), and its equivalent Chinese term, ‘ yi’ , refers both to the duty to
show respect and to the ritual form. 8 He quotes the Book of Rites, which
states that ‘ What results from disciplining attitudes by applying rites
is respect. It is from respect that prestige results. ’ 9 In other words, being
respectful is motivated by a duty and expressed in the form of rituals, and
only he who conducts himself respectfully will in turn elicit respect. What
the different rituals have in common is this imperative of respect for the
other, which plays the same role as what we call dignity.
In the case of both China and Europe, the issue is imposing rules on social
relations. However, the nature of the rules is quite different: in a law-bound
order, violation of the rule is sanctioned by cancelling the act or, where this
is impracticable, by repairing the damage caused. This principle of liability
gained constitutional status in France, on the basis of article 4 of the Declaration
of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen: ‘ Liberty consists of doing
anything which does not harm others: thus, the exercise of the natural rights
of each man has only those borders which assure other members of the
society the enjoyment of these same rights. These borders can be determined
only by the law. ’ 10 In a ritual order, however, liability cannot be defi ned
in this way. Rituals are not concerned with the outcome of actions, but
the way they are carried out. Someone who has behaved badly can neither
annul his or her bad conduct nor compensate for any losses, because this
behaviour cannot be calculated in fi nancial terms. The punishment is of a
different order: it is shame, or what in the East is called ‘ losing face ’ .
11
Africa, the Otherness of the Law 55

12 On the importance of this type of consultation in the practice of African rituals, see
M Cartry( 2011 ) ‘ Le chemin du rite ’ , Incidence 6, 37 – 44 . 13 See above, ch 2 , pp 39–40. See also P Legendre , ‘ L é galit édu rite ’in Sur la question dogmatique
en Occident ( Paris , Fayard , 1999 ) 259 – 72 . 14 A Honneth , Kampf um Anerkennung: Zur moralischen Grammatik sozialer Konfl ikte,

monde des concepts (n 2) 92 – 97.

But before we make the culturalist move of saying that we have found a
properly Eastern characteristic, unknown in the West, we should recall that
infringements of codifi ed good behaviour are punished in exactly this way in
the West. If a dinner guest gets abusive after drinking too much, offering to
pay compensation the next day will not rectify the situation, and since good
behaviour is constitutive of a person ’ s place in society, disrespect for such
rules will lead to the person ’ s downfall. And even if we look only at legal
rules, we fi nd that there is no unbridgeable gap between them and ritual
ones. Even Roman law stems from consultations given by experts in ritual
forms, 12 and legal formalism still retains something of that origin. 13 As for
rights and duties, they are inseparable: ‘ subjective ’rights imply the duty
to be respected by others, just as the duty to respect others is paired with
the right to be respected. These are two inseparable sides of the relations
between human beings. But it is symptomatic that in our societies the ‘ struggle
for recognition ’ , by which some authors characterise the second period
of social justice, 14 takes the form of claimed rights. Respect is then claimed
as an individual right rather than as a duty inherent to life in society. Similar
tendencies can be found in societies in which ritualism is dominant: it is not
that the law is ignored, but that it is coloured by other factors.

II. AFRICA, THE OTHERNESS OF THE LAW

African cultures do not conceive of society in terms of law. This is why
the colonising powers had such diffi culty translating the notion into the
vernaculars. A recent study by Danouta Liberski-Bagnoud has shown
how these diffi culties were overcome, in the case of the Gur (or Voltaic)
languages. 15 This family of languages includes the most widely spoken of the
61 languages of Burkina Faso, Mossi (six million speakers), a language which
distinguishes three types of norms: prohibitions linked to ritual observances,
which are beyond human will (Mossi: kigsu); edicts (Mossi: noor è , whose
primary meaning is ‘ mouth ’ ), which are issued by human authorities such as
the king or the elder of a lineage; and the intermediate category of prescriptions
attributed to recent ancestors whose alteration of a ritual later became
authoritative. The colonising powers, wishing to leave intact the rules governing
marriage, inheritance and land transfers, grouped these together under the

name of ‘ customary law ’ . Other terms were therefore needed to translate the
European idea of statutory law. The solution was to take two terms used by the
Mossi themselves in their subjection of the local populations before they were
colonised: tila ï (obligation) and panga (force / strength), both of which imply
illegitimate coercion using force. This was why, after Independence, it proved
diffi cult to convey the idea of a law to be observed by the whole population
because it was formulated by those to whom it applied. As for the notion of a
constitution, the Mossi term tengkugri was used by journalists keen to protect
this structure from their leaders ’ongoing habit of amending it as they pleased
in order to hang on to power indefi nitely. Tengkugri refers to a much-feared
fi gure of the Earth, sacred (inviolable), and fenced off by prohibitions. 16
The choice of this term was criticised as anti-democratic insofar as it placed
the number of presidential terms of offi ce beyond human will.
Thus sub-Saharan Africa had such a different vision of an orderly society
from the Western ideal of government by laws that even today few people
appreciate how much Africa has to offer Western legal thought under
globalisation. 17 For instance, ‘ speech assemblies ’[ assembl é es de parole], that
is, open deliberative practices leading to the adoption of shared norms —
which are, after all, what we call ‘ law ’in democracies — were already used
long before colonisation. 18 Yet the message addressed to African states over
the last 30 years has insistently been that they should import the European
democratic model, despite their own traditions, and despite the utter discredit
it suffered under colonisation. What most African elites retained from
colonialism was that this legal system (an import frequently also written by
Western jurists) was basically no different from the law of the jungle (Mossi:
panga), and likewise for the concept of the state. Given that the ‘ civilising
mission ’of the colonial state seemed primarily concerned with exploiting
local populations and resources, this arrogant and predatory state could
hardly be regarded as serving the local populations ’interests and meeting
their needs. After Independence, the new leaders simply stepped into the
shoes of the former colonial administrators, and the state continued its
predations. 19 In a note on colonisation written in 1943 for the French government
in exile in London, Simone Weil observed that

‘ the poison of scepticism is much more virulent where previously there was none.
Unfortunately we do not believe in much. And when we come into contact with
Africa, the Otherness of the Law 57

others, we seem to manufacture a species of man who believes in nothing at all.
If that continues, one day we will experience the backlash with a brutality of
which Japan (in 1943) gives us a foretaste. ’ 20

We will continue to be fl ummoxed by the diffi culties many African countries
have in constructing a workable state unless we recall that the model
inherited from colonialism is a predatory state. Many of the ruling elites
after Independence simply adopted this model, producing the fi gure of what
Joseph Tonda has called the ‘ modern Sovereign ’ .
21 And what is true of institutions
is also true of colonised individuals, who internalised something of
the identity of the coloniser, their ‘ intimate enemy ’ .
22
So there is nothing essential to Black Africa which makes it incapable
of achieving the rule of law. The state, far from being bloated, is sorely
lacking in its role of ensuring peace internally and guaranteeing people ’ s
fundamental rights. 23 This lack cannot be remedied by imposing ‘ models
of governance ’from the outside, dreamt up in Europe or the US. On the
contrary, these countries must be enabled to draw on what is best in their
own traditions, so that they may invent their own models of government. In
Africa as elsewhere, the choice is not between being dissolved into a ‘ global ’
culture and adopting the position of a victim, in an ossifi ed and essentialised
‘ local ’one. Tradition is everywhere a resource for renewal, and not an
obstacle to be overcome, nor a place to retreat into.
On this issue, we should remember that law and ritual are not binary
opposites, and that in practice they operate together in every culture. 24
We tend to overlook this because we understand ritualism as an archaic
and outdated form, and thus unthinkingly place the relations between law
and ritual within a linear history in which the former replaces the latter.
The narrative of this historical ‘ progress ’corresponds, in legal terms, to
a reduction in formalism and an increase in consensualism, which many
regard as supremely embodied by the history of Roman law: the pontiffs
prescribed, in oracular fashion, the rituals to be observed, and only later did
they become the guardians of laws. Although the idea of the law ’ s inviolability,
which marks the beginnings of government by laws in the West, still

represents an ideal for all lawgivers, 25 it is also a way of preserving something
of the stability of rituals. For, once written down, the law unleashes
what Marie Theres F ö gen rightly calls an ‘ explosive force ’ ,
26 like a kind of
atomic core generating mushrooming glosses by chain reaction. When the
free play of interpretations is no longer controlled by the strict limits of the
text, the reaction spirals out of control. So when laws and constitutions
are reduced to the status of ‘ legislative products ’ , and tools for governance,
the very idea of law is under threat. Instead of constituting a stable framework
within which human activities can take on sense for everyone, this
debasement of the law draws everything towards senselessness, a bit like a
house whose foundations become rubbery and whose walls keep moving.
All the great law-givers, from Solon (who, after drawing up the Athenian
laws, left the city for 10 years to avoid the temptation of changing them)
to Portalis, were acutely aware of the danger of a legislative hybris, which
ultimately destroys the very purpose of the law. It was in order to counter
precisely such a hybris that the Burkinab édecided to use the term tengkugri
to refer to their constitution, since it implies a prohibition which transcends
human will.
It is unlikely that a society can survive for long without stable rules and
without rituals. In twentieth-century totalitarian states, the contempt for
the law went hand in hand with an exaggerated use of rituals, invented for
the occasion to glorify a mythical past or a radiant future. Big business is
also fond of rituals, some of which are drawn from tradition, such as the
rites performed by Japanese fi rms when they inaugurate a new site, 27 but
most are standardised packages produced by event management specialists.
You want to see Bill Gates dance on stage ?Just come along to Microsoft ’ s
annual celebration of its fi nancial results. 28 And even societies as devoid of
rituals as our own have not yet abandoned funeral rites, however basic they
may have become.

III. CHINA, THE LEGALIST SCHOOL

No one would dream of suggesting to the Chinese government today
that it should divest itself of its ancient culture and embrace the modern
world. Like Japan half a century before it, China had adopted Westernstyle
laws in its First Chinese Republic (1911), which it harmonised with

its own traditions. 29 This process was interrupted under Mao, who dissolved
the legal form, but was resumed after 1978, 30 connecting back to the
synthesis of legalism and ritualism which had characterised its beginnings. 31
It is erroneous to believe that the art of government in China can be reduced
to Confucianism, with its particular model of ‘ government by men ’ . For
there is another tradition in China, that of ‘ government by laws ’ , which
played a major role in the foundation of the country ’ s imperial institutions,
and continues to shed light on issues today. The singular position of China
within the globalised world is arguably incomprehensible without an understanding
of what has been called the Legalist School (Fa-jia: 法家), which
still informs Chinese practices in government and big business.
The Legalist School developed in China during the Warring States period
(sixth to third centuries BC), a time of unrest and feudal struggles. Legalist
doctrine underpinned the fi rst empire, founded by Qin Shi Huang (221 – 10)
(the dynasty of Qin). This emperor did not leave fond memories among the
Confucian learned elite, whom he apparently burnt at the stake in large
numbers along with their books. But he was the fi rst emperor to set up a
centralised bureaucracy ruled by stable laws, which provided a more or less
exemplary model of government right up to the contemporary period. The
principal theoreticians of Legalism — Shang Yang, Shen Dao and above all
Han Fei 32— are as famous in China as Confucius or Lao Tseu. Their works
became known in France thanks to scholarly research, 33 fi rst and foremost
L é on Vandermeersch ’ s research into the formation of the Legalist School. 34
The conception of law current in that school derived from Taoism, for
which nature, the Tao, 35 is the only law. In Taoism, the universe is perceived

as a self-regulating system governed by interacting forces of creation and
destruction; neither rites nor royal ordinances have any moral basis. The
doctrine of the Legalists was developed in opposition to Confucianism and
its ideal of government by men, for which ritualism and the cultivation of
virtue were central. 36 However, the exceptionally long-lived institutions of
the Chinese Empire — from the second century BC to the beginning of the
twentieth century — were based on a mixture of this legalism and Confucian
ritualism. Many Chinese classics on the art of government refl ect this
synthesis, in their attempt to temper the totalitarian dimension of legalism
with ritualism. 37 Even today, legalism continues to show beneath the veneer
of Confucianism applied by the People ’ s Republic of China to the Socialist
market economy.
The Legalists thought it was useless to bank on human virtue because
only egoism exists. In their view, the Confucians were simply wrong to
believe that social harmony could be produced by instilling the Prince ’ s virtue
into the hearts of his subjects through the practice of rites. In opposition
to Mencius, who considered that ‘ human nature, like water, fl ows from high
to low ’ , the Legalists claimed that ‘ the people pursues its interest like water
fl ows down a slope ’ .
38 The question of government was therefore, rather,
how to make egoism work for the Prince. A good example of this problem
can be found on the battlefi eld. The individual soldier ’ s personal interest is
to take to his heels as soon as he can. To prevent this, the soldier must be
made to displace his fear onto something other than the enemy, which can
be done by punishing desertion with spectacular cruelty; and at the same
time he must be roused to battle by having his exploits in the fi eld rewarded,
which also inspires courage in the cowardly. Hence, for the Legalists, laws
were regarded as a technique for infl uencing people ’ s self-interest. Rejecting
rites as the means of ensuring order and unity, the Legalists highlighted
what was only a secondary measure for the Confucians, and considered
worthy only of those incapable of governing themselves, namely the criminal
law, and punishment, xing 形. The word xing in Chinese means both
‘ punishment ’and ‘ form ’ . Punishment is understood as re-form, which could
be physical (physical marks: castration, amputation, cutting off the nose,
etc), or symbolic (wearing red clothing, etc). The word f à 法, by contrast,
from which the Legalists ’name derived, meant ‘ Law of the Heavens ’in
China, the Legalist School 61

Selections, tr HB Hill( Madison, Wisconsin University Press , 1961 ) . 40 ‘ The two handles ’in Basic Writings of Han Fei Tzu (n 2), s XIV. 41 J Levi, Introduction to Han-Fei-tse ou le Tao du Prince, Han-Fei-tse ou le Tao du Prince,

ancient texts, and was the model which the sacred king was supposed to
imitate, that is, the universal law. In its archaic written form, the character
f à was composed of three elements, which represented:

— water (perfectly fl at, symbolising the idea of rectitude and justice)
— an element meaning ‘ to expel ’(everything crooked)
— a pictogramme representing a unicorn, reputedly able to detect those
who have not behaved with rectitude.

The Legalist doctrine was the result of bringing together xing and f à , and of
adding to the regime of punishments that of rewards. The art of government
consisted of using these ‘ two handles ’ — punishments and rewards. In Han
Fei Tzu ’ s words:

The Prince controls his ministers by means of two handles alone. The two handles
are punishment and favor. What do I mean by punishment and favor ?To infl ict
mutilation and death on men is called punishment; to bestow honor and reward
is called favor. Those who act as ministers fear the penalties and hope to profi t by
the rewards. Hence, if the ruler wields his punishments and favors, the ministers
will fear his sternness and fl ock to receive his benefi ts. 39

For the Legalists, law was thus a machine which the sovereign could use
to ensure social order, by manipulating the two sole motives for human
behaviour: greed and fear. To achieve this, the sovereign does not need to be
crafty or intelligent, nor to make a show of his power; on the contrary, he
should conceal it in order to become one with this impersonal and abstract
law. He must be able to count on the eyes and ears of his subjects, who
are made transparent to him because they all spy on each other, while he
himself remains invisible. 40 The Sovereign-Legalist is less a prince than a
principle: the principle of a law which transforms egoism into a force for
order. The comparison which inevitably springs to mind here is today ’ s
faith in the invisible hand of the market. In both cases, the order derived
from the manipulation of self-interest is linked to concealment of the loci of
power, or more precisely the immersion of power into a general system for
conditioning behaviour. One could say of our self-regulating market what
Jean Levi says of the Sovereign-Legalist: what the other sees is only ever
the polished mirror of nothingness. 41 But the Legalists did not believe that
order could emerge spontaneously from unbridled self-interest. The Prince
quelled his subjects only by implacably applying the criminal law, which

itself was successful in conditioning people ’ s self-interested behaviour only
if it was both objective and general.
This objectivity was predicated on publication of the laws. The fi rst
Chinese legal codes, carved onto tripod vessels, date from the sixth century
BC, and replaced the Annals, which only legal offi cials could consult.
Publication was meant to prevent purely subjective interpretations of the
law. A comparable shift towards codifi cation took place a century later in
Rome, when the Law of the Twelve Tables was promulgated. There was one
essential difference, however. The Legalists published laws not to satisfy the
demands of the people, but to restore the state ’ s authority. Concomitantly,
codifi cation did not lead to a legal system in the Western sense; that is, one
which also guarantees the rights of individual subjects. Classical Chinese
has no term for these rights. It was translated by qu á n 权, which refers to
the power — the ‘ two handles ’described by Han Fei Tzu — exercised by the
Prince through the law, namely to punish and to reward. The Legalists confi
scated these instruments from the learned bureaucratic class, and handed
them over to the sovereign.
Another important difference was that promulgating laws did not go
hand in hand with the idea of the law ’ s inviolability. Since laws were simply
an instrument of power at the sovereign ’ s disposal, they had to be effi cient,
not just. Also, their value was not in their relation to moral principles —
which are simply masks for the private interests of those who profess
them — nor of course in their refl ection of the will of the people. Rather,
laws conveyed an understanding of things. As such, they needed to evolve
with time, in order to respond to the changing context and to the lessons
learnt from their application. A famous treatise on government advises the
sovereign to change the laws according to the demands of the moment:
‘ Clothing and utensils must be adapted to the use which is made of them,
just as legislation must be appropriate to the society. This is why it is not
always a bad thing to change ancient rules, nor always judicious to preserve
them. ’ 42 In the West, not until very recently has the law been so totally
assimilated to an instrument of power, to a tool no different from a saw
or a hammer. And since the law was founded on effi ciency, there was no
place for contradiction: a more effi cient law naturally excludes one that is
less effi cient (a notion which resurfaced with Condorcet, and with the contemporary
Law and Economics school). 43 The law ’ s effi cacy depends not
only on being known, but also on being understood by everyone, which is
why the Legalists designed their system for the least educated, and did not
assume any perspicacity on the part of the people: ‘ The people are easy to

govern because they are stupid. The law can do this. If it is clear and easy to
understand, it will work necessarily. ’ 44
As a technique for conditioning subjects through punishments and
rewards, the law was applied to every individual and every area of life
in society. In opposition to the Confucian tradition, which exempted the
nobility from punishments involving physical mutilation because the performance
of rites was what disciplined them and, just as ‘ rites do not extend
down to the common people ’ , so the criminal law ‘ does not rise as far as
the nobles ’ ,
45 Legalist doctrine made the law absolutely universal. As Han
Fei Tzu states, ‘ When faults are to be punished, the highest minister cannot
escape; when good is to be rewarded, the lowest peasant must not be passed
over. To suppress disorder, muzzle lies, check excess, expose error and unify
the conduct of the people, nothing can compare with the law. ’ 46
The Legalists additionally subjected all aspects of life in society to the
law, including areas which in the West would be classed under a different
type of normativity, such as moral principles or technical standards.
As the etymology of the Chinese character f à shows, the law is related to
the sign for water. Like water, with its level surface symbolising equality,
the law indicates the right path with impartiality, and marks out the dividing
line between the true and the false, the just and the unjust. But it is
also placed under the sign of water as that which fl ows through the whole
social body. The Legalists borrowed from Taoism, which regards water in
its formlessness as a primordial element close to Tao, the idea that Tao produces
the law, dao sheng f à , or ‘ the Way engenders the Law ’ .
47 The law is
not based on a contract between free and equal subjects, but is created by
the interacting forces of Tao at work throughout the society. Jean L é vi comments
that ‘ what makes it possible for the law to impregnate and irrigate the
social whole is a political organisation in which the population is divided
up into interlocking territorial units, where behaviour is fashioned through
collective responsibility and mutual surveillance from the lowest level — the
brigade — upwards. ’ 48
As such, when laws are diffused throughout the social body and supplemented
by a system of generalised surveillance, they produce order and
effi ciency. These two aspects are combined in the organisation of work,
which is entirely governed by criminal law, and where no separation may
exist between moral, disciplinary and technical norms and standards. L é on
Vandermeersch gives a particularly striking example of this, dating from the
64 Other Perspectives on Law

fi rst century BC, concerning the introduction of new agricultural techniques
for increasing the yields of the land in the Kingdom of Wei:

In Wei, in the 3rd month, during celebration of the rites, the agricultural offi cials
read out the law to the peasants. The law said ‘ If you plough without driving
the ploughshare deep into the earth, your labour will not break up the soil. In
the fi elds in Spring, fl atten the earth like a sheet before planting. In the fi elds in
Summer, fl ock together to work, in as large numbers as the ducks. In the fi elds
in Autumn, keep a constant watchful eye, for the unforeseen arrives like a thief.
In the fi elds in Winter, spy on one another, as the people of Wu and of Yu observe
each other [ that is, as enemies]: if your harvest is of the last of the lowest quality
on fi elds of the highest fi rst quality, you will be punished; if your harvest is of the
highest fi rst quality on fi elds of the last lowest quality, you will be rewarded. ’ 49

One can hazard a guess that something of this tradition persists today in
the way China ’ s large industrial companies are governed, and in the total
control which they seek to exercise over their workers. More generally, this
rapid incursion into the writings of the Chinese Legalists already gives us
some idea of how their conception of the law resembles, and also differs
from, the dominant paradigm in the West. Both models aspire to objectivity,
equality and generality, but the Chinese version has three distinguishing
features: enforceable individual rights are inexistent (the lex is not combined
here with a ius which is a source of individual prerogatives); what in the
West would pertain to theology, morals or technology is here encompassed
within the sphere of law; and, lastly, the law is judged by its effi ciency and
not by its justice. These three markers can help us measure the extent to
which globalisation has brought these Western and the Chinese ideas of law
closer together.
The Legalist doctrine was supported by merchants and tradesmen exasperated
by the arrogance and hypocrisy of the nobles, and by the anarchic
political situation which undermined economic prosperity. So it is hardly
surprising that their idea of the human being had much in common with
the West ’ s characterisation of the homo economicus and with utilitarian
philosophy. Some twenty centuries after the Legalists, the utilitarians
likewise regarded the pursuit of individual interests as the only real motivating
force behind human behaviour. But in utilitarianism, this pursuit
was understood as the best way to produce social harmony. It is private
vices that engender public benefi ts, Bernard Mandeville remarked at the
very beginning of the eighteenth century. This founding credo of the liberal
economic order is illustrated in a famous passage from Adam Smith ’ s
The Wealth of Nations: ‘ It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the
brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to
China, the Legalist School 65

their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their
self-love. ’ 50 Dany-Robert Dufour has shown in a recent book that this idea
of the automatic conversion of private vices into public benefi ts has religious
origins. 51 It derives from a belief in the capacity of divine providence
to redeem human imperfections in order to lead humankind to salvation.
In its secular form of the invisible hand of the market, this faith in divine
providence has made individual economic freedoms into the cornerstone of
the legal order. By contrast, such a faith in the miraculous virtues of egoism
was completely foreign to Chinese Legalism, whose purely rationalistic
conception of the world stemmed from Taoism. Although the Legalists ’
disenchanted view of humankind as motivated exclusively by greed and
fear has a certain resonance with liberal ideology, they never envisaged that
unleashing desires and passions could produce anything other than chaos.
Giving free reign to individual egoism cannot produce harmony because
egoism imprisons people in a short-term vision of calculated personal interests,
and blinds them to any long-term interests, be it their own or those of
the group. As the Legalists put it, egoism encourages people to behave like
the child who refuses to let his head be shaved, although it is to prevent him
getting lice. The legal system can in consequence be based only on seeking
rewards and fearing punishments. It is a unifi ed and impersonal system,
which aspires to produce a self-regulated society in which the laws apply
equally to everyone, and where there is no distinction between what we
would call legal, moral and technical norms.
Further research into Legalism by specialists on Ancient China would
not only enrich comparative law, but it would also give depth to our understanding
of the specifi city of the modes of government demonstrated by the
Chinese state and Chinese businesses in the international arena today. This
project is itself predicated on building strong bridges between research on
ancient civilisations and research on the contemporary world, in order to
avoid clich é s and hasty judgements (instead of which there is a tendency to
draw fi ercely defended frontiers between the two). It is a risky venture, since
the appropriation of scholarly work can always lead to approximations and
simplifi cations, but such work is vital for any well-grounded legal analysis
of globalisation, for which the Western tradition, whether in the form of
economic liberalism or of Marxism, is too limiting a framework. Contemporary
China, with its constitutional ‘ democratic dictatorship ’and its ‘ socialist
market economy ’ ,
52 does not fi t neatly into either of these forms, and
requires us to refl ect differently upon its mode of government and its relation

to the rule of law. Kristofer Schipper has argued that Legalism remains a
dominant infl uence in China to this day, with a veneer of Confucianism to
give an appearance of humanity to what is overwhelmingly state control
and bureaucratic power. 53 If we accept Schipper ’ s analysis, we can make
two further claims to end this chapter.
The fi rst point is that a more profound comparative analysis of Western
and Chinese traditions of government by laws can help us understand their
different perceptions of globalisation. For Western governments — and especially
for Europeans — globalisation means that the spontaneous order of the
market henceforth rules the whole world, and that far from impeding this
dominion, states should be its willing vehicle, ensuring only the universal
recognition of economic freedoms and respect for fi rst-generation (civil and
political) human rights. For the Chinese government, on the other hand, an
order founded purely on the pursuit of individual interest is another name
for chaos. This might be tolerated abroad, but not in China, where this
pursuit must be harnessed to the national interest by a strong state which
encourages wealth creation while strictly policing its population and meting
out harsh punishment for any infringement of the political order as it
stands.
Our second claim, which we expand on below, 54 is that the new world
order which emerged after the collapse of real communism should not be
interpreted as a victory of the West over the East, or the rule of law over
totalitarianism, but rather as a hybrid form of communism and liberalism;
in other words a form of what the Chinese Constitution precisely calls a
‘ socialist market economy ’ , partaking of both systems.

example in the controversy over Quietism in the seventeenth century. 2 The notion of calculated harmony comes from Pierre Legendre( La fabrique de l ’ homme

The Dream of Social Harmony
by Numbers

‘ Everything is ordered according to number. ’

Pythagoras

THE SPECTACULAR SUCCESS of the model of governance by
numbers is no historical accident. Nature ’ s ultimate principles had
long been represented by a mixture of numbers and rules (through
physics and mathematics), and the social order, by a mixture of quantitative
economics and law. The religious sphere likewise admitted a composite
of submission to divinely given laws and mystical contemplation of absolute
truths, as two different ways of attaining the godhead. 1 Governance
by numbers does not in fact abolish laws, but it submits their contents to
a calculation of utility designed to serve the ‘ economic harmonies ’which
reputedly ensure the smooth functioning of human societies. 2 But can the
law be reduced to numbers ?Does law do something other than express the
perfect harmonies formulated by mathematics ?Does it not have a purpose
of its own, to overcome the strife inherent in life in society ?Our leaders
confront these questions daily, torn between quantitative representations of
the economy and society, and whatever remains of democratic representations
of the social body. In order to understand both the ancient origins of
governance by numbers and its foreseeable failures in the future, we shall
again adopt a historical perspective.

I. THE PERFECT HARMONIES OF NUMBERS

The fascination with numbers and their systematising powers is age-old,
and not confi ned to the Western world. Chinese thought is pervaded by the
68 The Dream of Social Harmony by Numbers

3 cf Marcel Granet, who devotes a chapter to numbers in his La Pens é e chinoise [1934]
(Paris, Albin Michel, 1968) 127ff. 4 Nicomachus of Gerasa, Theology of Arithmetic, quoted by M Ghyka , Philosophie et
mystique du nombre ( Paris , Payot , 1952 ) 11 . 5 cf E Cassirer , The Individual and the Cosmos in Renaissance Philosophy [ 1963 ],

symbolic value of numbers, 3 and the Indian, Arab and Persian worlds have
contributed enormously to mathematics. But the West was where numbers
were vested with the most potential: as objects of contemplation, then as
tools of knowledge and prognostication, and today as tools of governance,
after being endowed with legal force. One might be tempted to fi nd an origin
in a Biblical source, the Book of Wisdom, in which it is stated that God
has ‘ arranged all things by measure and number and weight ’(Wis 11:20).
But we would have to add that this book was (apparently) written directly
in Greek in the second century BC by a Hellenistic Jew who was probably
infl uenced by the Pythagorean revival. And it is apparently Pythagoras
(-580/-500 BC) who claimed that ‘ Everything is ordered according to
number ’ , an idea developed further by the philosopher and mathematician
Nicomachus of Gerasa (fi rst century AD) in the following terms:

Everything that has been arranged systematically by nature in the Universe appears
in its parts as in the whole to have been determined by and harmonised with
Numbers, through the foresight and thought of he who created all things; for its
model was fi xed, like a preliminary sketch, by the preeminence of numbers preexisting
in the mind of God the creator of the world, number-ideas which are purely
immaterial in every respect, but at the same time the true and eternal essence,
such that in harmony with numbers, as though following an artistic design, were
created all these things, and Time, movement, the heavens, the stars and all the
cycles of all things. 4

The idea that numbers were thus the key to the divine order has had an
extraordinary legacy, from Pythagoras to this day, in particular through the

continues to fuel our imagination today. ‘ The world is mathematical ’was
the title of a book series headed by C é dric Villani, a 2010 Fields Medalist
and the Director of the Institut Henri-Poincar é , for the newspaper
Le Monde, in 2013. Mathematics — today as in the past — is deemed to be the
key to understanding — and hence mastering — the world, a claim echoed not
only in numerous philosophical, scientifi c and mystical works, but also in
the conviction that a numerical ‘ legality ’exists, as expressed in cosmology,
theology, music, ethics and law. 8
Within this numerical symbolism, the scholarly and mystical Confraternity
of Pythagoreans placed particular emphasis on the number 10. The group ’ s
emblem was the esoteric symbol of the Tetractys, a triangle of 10 points,
on which its members swore an oath never to divulge their secrets, especially
not those pertaining to mathematics. It was the geometrical fi gure of
the number 10, represented as an equilateral triangle whose tip is one, and
whose sides are three times four.

Michael Stolleis ’ s research on the metaphor of ‘ the eye of the Law ’has
shown that the Tetractys is present throughout Western history. Masons and
kabbalists used it, and although it was rejected by Christianity as a pagan
element, it was recycled as a fi gure of the Trinity, 9 and then of the eye of

God. Thereafter it continued its course, and was secularised as the eye
of the Law. 10 This is the symbol we fi nd, still laden with its religious, legal
and mathematical symbolism, when we look at the reverse side of a one
dollar note today. Represented are the two sides of the Great Seal of the United
States of America, including a pyramid, dated 1776 at its base, and at its tip,

The Tetractys was a symbol of the cosmos (of a universe saved from chaos),
and also represented harmony. 11 Harmony, the daughter of Ares, the god
of war, and of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, has represented the uniting
of opposites and the resolving of discord and disagreement ever since
the Ancient Greeks. In European Union law, ‘ harmonisation ’means either
materialising in law the economic freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), or a spontaneously produced
outcome of using these freedoms. In the terms of the Treaty ’ s Article 151,
the ‘ functioning of the internal market ’ — the freedom given economic operators
to act on the basis of their calculated interest alone — should result
in the ‘ harmonisation of social systems ’ . The convergence of national
legislations has only a subsidiary role, to accompany this spontaneous
operation. Somewhat like the Decretum Gratiani eight centuries earlier, the
The Perfect Harmonies of Numbers 71

12 TFEU, Art 136. 13 This way of defi ning sounds in terms of harmonic proportions was highly infl uential right
up to the nineteenth century, when the physicist and acoustician Hermann von Helmholtz
‘ objectively ’defi ned the frequency of each sound in absolute terms. cf M Rieger , Helmholtz
Musicus. Die Objektivierung der Musik im 19 Jahrhundert durch Helmholtz ’Lehre von den
Tonempfi ndungen ( Darmstadt , Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft , 2006 ) esp 49ff .

European Treaty thus hoped to establish a ‘ reconciliation of contradictory
canons ’( Concordia discordantium canonum), and a ‘ harmonisation while
[the] improvement is being maintained ’ ,
12 by overcoming the diversity of
national legislations and the imperative of competition. Unlike in Gratian,
however, this reconciliation was not to be achieved by the law (since the
alignment of national legislations is conceived simply as a facilitator), but
rather was to emerge as the by-product of the economic calculations of an
‘ internal market ’ . The redactors of the Treaty of Rome instituted and delimited
this market under EU law, but they certainly did not have in mind a
global market where all obstacles to the free circulation of goods and capital
would be abolished. This utopia of a total market engendering social harmony
spontaneously across the whole planet only emerged a few decades
later, with the triumph of neoliberalism.
The Pythagorean mysticism of numbers understood harmony to be
conceived either as a result of an immediately achieved perfect eurythmy,
or from the consonance of opposing principles, on the model of musical
harmonies which transcend dissonance. The Greeks measured musical frequencies
in terms of the ratios between string lengths (length and frequency
are inversely proportional: the longer the string, the lower the frequency).
The ideal order of numbers contained in the Pythagorean Tetractys was
immediately linked with the laws of musical harmony because the Tetractys
contained the main ratios of the diatonic scale:

— the ratio 4:2 or 2:1, the octave
— 3:2, a fi fth
— 4:3, a fourth.

However, to accommodate further ratios, another number was required,
the number 12, which is divisible by all the numbers of the Tetractys: 1,
2, 3 and 4. For example, the consonance of two strings of length 12 and 6
corresponds to the interval of an octave (12:6), that of two strings of length
12 and 8 to a fi fth (3:2), and that of two strings of length 12 and 9 to a fourth
(12:9). These consonances of an octave (12:6), a fi fth (3:2) and a fourth
(12:9) correspond to the arithmetical ratios 2/1, 3/2, and 4/3. These are not
only arithmetical but also geometrical ratios because 9 is a square number
(3 squared), 6 is the number of faces of a cube, 8 the number of points
of a cube, and 12 the number of its edges. 13 This perfect correspondence

between mathematical proportions and musical harmonies was interpreted
as the sign of a cosmic harmony to which one may have access through
the contemplation of numbers. 14 One of the most powerful motives behind
scientifi c endeavours in the West was the desire to penetrate the secrets of
this universal harmony.
Not only should this harmony resonate in all works of human hand —
from the most modest manufactured object to the work of art — but it
should also operate between people, by establishing ‘ concord ’ , a perfect harmony
which transcends differences. As shown by these terms ’etymology,
harmony and concord (and their antonyms of dis-harmony and dis-cord)
have at once an auditory sense (the consonance of sounds) and an emotional
one, with the union, or dis-union, of affections. 15 Bringing humans
together in harmony requires both that hearts should beat in unison and
that strong bonds should be forged between them. Harmony in this sense
achieves a universal dimension through its mathematical expression. This
is abundantly conveyed by its representations, for instance, on the walls of
Chartres Cathedral, in Renaissance painting, and even in certain twentiethcentury
literary works depicting an ideal world of erudition. 16
One of the treatises on the art of government to have profoundly infl uenced
the Renaissance Neo-Platonists was Cicero ’ s De re publica, in which
the law is central. It ends on the account of a fi ctional dream in which Scipio
is visited by his ancestor Africanus, who reveals to him that ‘ nothing on earth
is more agreeable to the foremost of the gods, the governor of the universe,
than the assemblies and societies of men united together by laws, which are
called States ’ .
17 Africanus then transports him to the nine heavenly spheres
which compose the universe, and asks him to listen to the music they produce,
while explaining that what he hears is the result of ‘ their motion and
impulse; and being formed by unequal intervals, but such as are divided
according to the most just proportion, it produces, by duly tempering acute
with grave sounds, various concerts of harmony ’ .
18 Mathematics, physics
and music are here as one, and together they create the celestial harmony
which the law must materialise in the state. It is somewhat disconcerting,

given today ’ s legal positivism, to fi nd in a treatise on the institutions of
the res publica this kind of dream story, with its aesthetic and mathematical
considerations. But the contemporary doctrine of Law and Economics
does something very similar in its claim to found social harmony on mathematical
operations — although it should be noted that Scipio ’ s humanity is
missing from today ’ s homo economicus, who could neither dream nor even
imagine that the Invisible Hand could be that of a musician.
This ongoing mathematical infl uence on legal thought, from the Renaissance
to the present, is shown particularly well in an incisive commentary
by Marie Theres F ö gen on Raphael ’ s famous fresco The School of Athens
(although I have some reservations about her conclusion). 19 She uses this
fresco (situated in the Room of the Signatura in the Vatican) as an illustration
of Livy ’ s narrative of the establishment of the Law of the Twelve Tables.
The question she is trying to answer is why, at the origin of Roman Law,
should there be 12 and not 10 tables (the number sacred to Pythagoreans,
and also the number of the Commandments).

II. THE FOUNDATIONAL FUNCTION OF DISCORD

In Livy ’ s account, the Tables were created by an appointed assembly of
10 sages, the decemvirate, in 457 BC. Its membership was identical to that
of the Tetractys: one consul from the preceding year; two consuls from the
current year; three envoys who had returned from Greece; and four elders
appointed, in Livy ’ s words, ‘ to make up the number ’ ; 20 in other words, the
sacred number 10. The laws drawn up by these 10 sages were transcribed
onto ten tables, which were presented to the Roman citizens for discussion,
and then adopted by the comitia, or citizens ’legislative assembly. A rumour
then spread that there were two tables missing ‘ which, if added to the others
[ … ], would have formed a complete corpus of Roman law ’ .
21 Another
decemvirate was therefore appointed, among them Appius Claudius, who
had already worked on drawing up the fi rst set. But this new assembly
behaved tyrannically. Appius Claudius infringed the laws he himself had
drafted, and he also abused his role of judge in a case in which he gave
a young and beautiful plebeian, called Virginia, to be the slave of one of
his henchmen. In order to spare her the enslavement and dishonour awaiting
her, Virginia ’ s father had no choice but to stab her to death. Appalled
by such injustice, the people rebelled, and Claudius ended up committing

suicide in captivity. When peace returned to a city governed thereafter by
the Twelve Tables of the Law, these were displayed in the Roman Forum,
in 449 BC.
This narrative of the origins of Roman law is worth dwelling on, because
it concerns at once numbers (10, then 12), and law. In Marie Theres F ö gen ’ s
interpretation, the Romans had to experience a lack of law before a legal
system, and the resulting society harmony, could prevail. We take issue
with this interpretation, however, because it is both anachronistic and misleading:
where there is no law, it cannot be broken, and Claudius Appius ’ s
crime was precisely to have broken the laws in place, which he himself had
drafted. The conclusion we can draw from this narrative of the origins of
the law is, rather, that no legal system can hold if founded on a calculating
rationality alone.
Yet if this ideal of a calculated social harmony has so tenaciously haunted
Western legal thought, it is perhaps because of the West ’ s inability to grasp
the unity, at a deeper level, of law and its violation, of order and disorder.
We shall address this possibility by looking briefl y to how other civilisations
view the relation between order and disorder. Heinrich Zimmer has noted
an interesting detail in Hindu cosmogony. 22 At the very moment when the
god Vishnu conceives the advent of a perfect world, and despite his beauty,
he has dirt in his ears! It is out of this dirt that Madhu and Kaitabha, the
demons of passion and stupidity, are born, and it is they who will sow
the fi rst seeds of disorder in the cosmos. In the Western tradition, by contrast,
the godhead is purely positive, with no demonic dimension. Zimmer
reminds us that human beings achieve selfhood only by confronting the
shadowy, negative side of their being: ‘ How else, ’he writes, ‘ could men
enter into contact with external and internal reality, except through guilt ?
How could one be rooted in reality without some failing ?It is only through
failings that one learns who one is; before that, one is simply fl oating in the
realm of appearances. ’ 23 Returning to our analysis, rather than postulate an
improbable passage via ‘ lawlessness ’ , we would suggest thinking together at
once the democratic process of deliberation (which led to the fi rst ten tables
being adopted) and the collective revolt against injustice (which led to the
adoption of the last two tables). The rule of law cannot be established by
mathematical calculation, but only through the experience of injustice and
the passions. The narrative of the foundation of Roman Law thus shows
not only the hubris of human passions which trample the law underfoot,
but also the hubris of a perfect law determined by numbers. It enables us

to understand the logic of the passage from 10, the perfect number, to 12,
the key to harmony. The Twelve Tables are the result both of rational
deliberation and of a revolt or struggle inspired by a sense of injustice.
And even of two struggles: fi rst the plebeians, who fought for Rome to
adopt a law which was equal for everyone, on the model of Greece; and then
all the citizens of Rome, to oblige the leaders themselves to submit to the
law. The primal scene of Roman law thus exposes at once the fruitlessness
of pursuing an ideal order founded on numbers, and the need for a system,
however imperfect it may be, founded on experience.
Machiavelli referred to this founding Roman narrative to prove that good
laws are those which are born of the experience of confl ict:

In every republic there are two confl icting factions, that of the people and that of
the nobles; it is in this confl ict that all laws favourable to freedom have their origin
[ … ]. We cannot truly declare …the republic [the Roman Republic] to have been
disorderly …wherein we fi nd so many instances of virtue; for virtuous actions
have their origin in right training, right training in wise laws, and wise laws in
these very tumults which many would thoughtlessly condemn. 24

Machiavelli ’ s discovery is nothing short of scandalous, as Claude Lefort has
pointed out: in a free republic, the law is not the outcome of level-headed
reasoning but of the clash of two equally limitless desires, that of the nobles
to possess ever more; and that of the people not to be oppressed. This is also
why the law is never laid down once and for all, but is always open to the
confl icts through which it is reformed. 25
The Greeks themselves were aware, in their refl ections on law, of the
impossibility of giving justice a purely mathematical basis. In Nicomachean
Ethics, Aristotle attempted to express in mathematical terms the different
types of justice he identifi ed. But contrary to what all the textbooks on the
philosophy of law say, 26 he discovered three, not two, forms of justice. The
fi rst two are represented in the allegory of Buon Governo, in the Palazzo
Pubblico in Siena. 27 We can identify distributive justice, which distributes
‘ honour or money or such other assets as are divisible among the members
of the community, 28 and which is proportional to the person ’ s merit, as
Aristotle describes: ‘ This kind of proportion is called geometrical by mathematicians
[ … ]. For justice that is distributive is always in accordance with
the proportion [to merit] because if the distribution is made from common

funds it will be in the same ratio as the corresponding contributions [to the
community] bear to one another ’ .
29 And there is also rectifi catory justice,
which consists of repairing the harm unjustly infl icted on one person by
another. This second type of justice obeys an arithmetical, and not a geometrical,
principle of equality: ‘ What the judge does is restore equality. It is
as if a line were divided into two unequal parts; the judge takes away that
by which the greater segment exceeds the half of the line, and adds it to the
lesser segment ’ .
30
However, the typology does not end there. As Fran ç ois Ewald, and later
Clarisse Herrenschmidt, have noted, 31 Aristotle completes the picture
with a third type of justice: a justice of proportional reciprocity, which he
introduces as follows:

The idea of reciprocity does not square with either distributive or rectifi catory
justice [ … ]. Nevertheless, in associations for exchange, what sustains the community
is this type of justice, but it is reciprocity based on proportion, not on strict
equality. [ … ] It is because one returns the equivalent of what one has received that
the state holds together. 32

This type of justice — which prefi gures our social justice — is, according to
Aristotle, indispensable to exchange, which alone holds humans together.
And it requires agreement on a standard which all citizens will respect when
they exchange the fruits of their labour.

Proportional exchange or requital involves an equation between diametrically
opposed terms: for example, a builder [A], a shoemaker [B], a house [C], and
a shoe [D]: the builder receives from the shoemaker part of what he produces,
and the shoemaker part of the builder ’ s production. There can be no exchange
or association between them if the transaction is not in some way equal: there
must, therefore, be one standard by which all commodities are measured.
This standard is in fact demand, which holds everthing together. …Demand has
come by convention to be represented by money. It is called money [ nomisma],
Aristotle continues, because it does not exist naturally but by law [ nomos], and it
is hence in our power to change it or withdraw it from circulation. 33

This passage is vital for understanding how Aristotle links law and numbers
in his refl ections on justice. Unlike Plato, he does not regard law as simply
a stand-in required because of our inability to grasp the mathematical
truths which govern the universe. Figures and numbers are indeed useful —
they can illustrate the defi nitions of distributive and rectifi catory justice,
as Aristotle shows — but they cannot determine social bonds. The need to
The Foundational Function of Discord 77

34 Herrenschmidt, Les Trois É critures (n 34) 299.

bring together similar needs but different activities is what produces the
social bond, and Aristotle provides no mathematical formulation for this
third type of justice. Likewise, money is not conceived as the spontaneous
expression of the fair price of the products of human labour, but as a
‘ substitute for demand ’ , which serves as a common measure for the goods
to be exchanged; it is based on law and not number, as the derivation of
numisma from nomos illustrates. The justice of transactions is therefore
neither a question of mathematics nor of morals: if I wish to measure the
value of the work of a trader on the fi nancial markets or a nurse in a hospital,
I require neither calculations, nor ethics, but law. And more specifi cally,
today, social law.
Clarisse Herrenschmidt has shown, in her Les Trois É critures, that the
awareness of the limits of mathematical rationality for the organisation of
human affairs was infl uenced by the discovery of irrational numbers such
as √2 — the length of the hypotenuse of the simplest right-angled triangle —
which cannot be represented as a ratio of integers. In her view, this sort of
incommensurable length led, during the fourth century BC, to the replacement
of geometrical fi gures on coins by political symbols: ‘ If there exist
magnitudes without a common measure, then everything is not proportional
to everything else. Consequently, the arithmetical-geometric quality
of monetary writing had no basis other than human beings and their squabbles
’ .
34 With these discoveries, the dream of having human communities
governed by a mathematically deducible harmony, in tune with the music of
the spheres, disappeared. Yet it is a dream which has continued to haunt the
West in different guises up to our own times — and sometimes in the form
of a nightmare.

The Development of Normative Uses
of Quantifi cation

The notion of government has been simplifi ed: numbers alone make laws and the
law. Politics has been reduced to a question of arithmetic.

Alexis de Tocqueville, The Old Regime and the Revolution1

S
OME REMARKABLE HISTORICAL scholarship has been carried
out over the last 30 years on the quantifi cation of economic and social
facts in the modern era, 2 showing the state’s concern with perfecting
instruments to measure its wealth and population. The most important of
these instruments is statistics, a term derived from the German Staatistik, a
‘ science of the state ’( Staatswissenschaft), but whose contents actually corresponded
more to what in England was called ‘ political arithmetic ’ . The
difference was that Staatistik sought to give an overall picture of the state
without using quantifi cation, whereas ‘ political arithmetic ’ , or statistics,
was entirely based on quantitative surveys. 3 Although, in both cases, the
normative uses of quantifi cation seem to have the state as their central protagonist,
in fact they were fi rst developed in the private sphere, to assist in
business management. We shall therefore start with this corporate sphere,
before examining the much better known history of the rise of public statistics
and calculations of probability. From the different uses of quantifi cation,
both private and public, we shall be able to tease out its four normative
functions, as they developed historically: accounting; managing; judging;
and legislating.
Accounting 79

I. ACCOUNTING

Accounting ledgers are doubtless the fi rst modern expression of the link
made between numbers and law, quantifi cation and legal obligation. In its
Commercial Code, French law defi nes the ‘ fi nancial obligations applicable
to all traders ’in the following terms:

Article L 123-12— All natural or legal persons with the status of trader shall
enter in their accounts the movements affecting the value of their company. These
movements shall be recorded chronologically.

These persons must check the existence and value of the assets and liabilities of the
company by means of an inventory at least once every twelve months.

They must prepare annual accounts at the end of the fi nancial year in view of the
entries made in the accounts and the inventory. These annual accounts shall consist
of the balance sheet, 4 the profi t and loss account 5 and an annex, all of which
shall form an inseparable whole.

Article L 123-14— The annual accounts shall be honest and truthful and shall
ensure a fair representation of the assets, fi nancial situation and results of the
company.

Where the application of an accounting requirement is not suffi cient to ensure
the fair representation indicated in this article, additional information must be
provided in the annex.

If, in an exceptional case, the application of an accounting requirement proves
to be unsuitable in order to ensure a fair representation of the assets, fi nancial
situation or results, an exception must be made to this. This exception shall be
indicated in the annex and duly reasoned, with an indication of its effect on the
assets, fi nancial situation and results of the company.

In this defi nition, accounting operates within four legal parameters. First, the
obligation to prepare accounts. Merchants must be able to account for their
activities before third parties, and preparing accounts is part of this commercial
liability, which is not solely to contracting parties but beyond this
to the state and the public in general. 6 The term ‘ accountability ’precisely
contains an idea of fi nancial liability, requiring an accountor (who must render
account), an accountee (to whom the accounts are submitted) and an
accountant (who prepares the accounts). Today, accounting obligations are
enshrined in law, but in the medieval period, when modern accounting was

4 The balance sheet shows the company ’ s assets at a particular moment, namely at the end
of the accounting year. 5 This account shows the profi t and losses for the accounting period, and justifi es the overall
result. 6 The concept of ‘ commercial liability ’does not seem to have been studied for itself in
recent doctrine. See the nomenclature of the tradesman ’ s responsibilities in Jacques Mestre ,
Isabelle Arnaud-Grossi, Laure Merland, Marie-Eve Pancrazi, Nancy Tagliarimo- Vignal , Droit
commercial, 29th edn( Paris , LGDJ , 2012 ) 249ff, 236ff .

fi rst invented, they were stipulated by the guilds, or what Berthold Goldman
has called the lex mercatoria.7 Later, the Italian city states made book-keeping
obligatory for merchants, as a system of proof and a way of preventing
bankruptcy. Etymologically, ‘ bankruptcy ’is the destruction of the bench; that
is, the counter the bankrupt merchant had occupied in the marketplace. From
the outset, then, keeping accounts was one of the merchant’s responsibilities.
Secondly, accounting is a way of accrediting a truth through an image.
The notion of ‘ fair view ’(in French, ‘ image fi d è le’ ; a faithful image), which
recurs in Article L 123-14 of the French Commercial Code (introduced via
the European Directive no 78/660/CEE of 25 July 1978) is an abbreviation
of the English formula, ‘ true and fair view ’ . The accounting image thus
has the status of an icon: religious icons unite a community of the faithful
around a religious truth, just as accounting images federate a community of
merchants around a legally backed truth. With this shared faith in a divine
guarantor for pledges made, merchants could obtain credit from one end of
Europe to the other. 8 As late as the nineteenth century, many industrialists
placed their accounting books under the protection of God. And inversely,
when the accounting image proves deceptive, such that it can no longer
inspire collective belief, the whole community falls apart. This is what happened
with the American company Enron. Having risen to stratospheric
heights on the stock exchange, it crashed over a couple of weeks at the end
of 2001, when the accounting ploys on which its apparent wealth had been
based became known. 9 The Sarbanes-Oxley Law passed by the American
Congress in 2002 showed the lessons learnt: the law strengthened accounting
regulations and attempted to break the collusion between companies and
audit fi rms, but more importantly it reactivated the old religious principle on
which the veracity of accounts is based, by obliging the heads and fi nancial
directors of quoted companies to certify their books under oath. Foreign
companies trading on the US markets were under the same obligation, with
stiff penalties for non-compliance. 10 The accounts must be a true and a fair
image because they are a vital pillar of the market system, a point of articulation
of the true and the just. As such, accounting standards necessarily

refer to a certain representation of justice, and are not simply politically
neutral technical norms. Only ignorance, or the wish to mask this political
dimension, can have led the EU to entrust accounting standardisation to a
private agency, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 11
Thirdly, accounting is also the fi rst modern system to have conferred on
numbers the value of a legally backed truth. As the French Commercial
Code states, the fi gures acquire probative force: ‘ Article L 123-23 — Duly
kept accounts may be accepted by the courts in order to act as proof between
traders in respect of commercial instruments ’ .
12 The way these fi gures were
arrived at, and the many qualitative decisions taken to get there, simply
fall away, unlike what occurs when a law has been passed or a contract
has been signed. For whereas laws or contracts are expressed in a natural
language and so remain open to interpretation, numbers are not accessible
in this way. The dogmatic value assigned to numbers in certifi ed accounts is
not absolute, however. An Annex which ‘ shall supplement and comment on
the information given in the balance sheet and the profi t and loss account ’
confi rms that the accounting presentation is true and fair, when this cannot
be perceived from the fi gures alone.
Lastly, accounting is the fi rst technique to have made money into a
universal standard of value. Money makes different things commensurable.
13 Its function as a unit of measurement is different from its function
as a means of payment, and there is no reason why the two should
be confl ated, as we do today. 14 In a barter economy, one should be able
to exchange a consultation with a doctor for a certain number of bottles
of wine, by referring each to the same unit of account. This unit
would simply serve as a reference for both parties, and not as a means
to dissolve the obligation, which is only done by handing over the bottles.
The idea of separating these two functions of money recurs periodically.
Keynes, for instance, tried to do this after the Second World War
when he proposed an accounting currency which he called the ‘ bancor ’
as an international monetary reference, to protect the economy from
national currency manipulation (and from the hegemony of the dollar —
which is why Keynes ’ s proposal failed). More recently, the French statesman
Jean-Pierre Chev è nement proposed a similar uncoupling, in order to
compensate for the evident design faults of the single European currency. 15

82 The Development of Normative Uses of Quantifi cation

The euro could indeed cease to be the means of payment in France, without
even having to change the provisions of the Commercial Code, which states
that ‘ The accounting documents shall be expressed in Euros and drafted in
the French language ’ (Article L 123-22 )’ .
16 Ever since the Bretton Woods
agreement was abandoned in 1971, money has been treated as a commodity
like any other, but this can only be sustained if its function as a measure
of value is concealed. On any market worthy of the name, the weights
and measures which are the common reference enabling exchange to take
place cannot themselves be treated as things to be exchanged. The refusal
to consider this foundational function of money inevitably ruins any market
economy. 17 Be that as it may, accounting exploits money ’ s function as
a standard of value, to measure not only the value of existing goods of all
sorts, but also credit-worthiness, or, more generally, future values. In other
words, the word ‘ accounting ’is deceptive: it precisely does not count (in the
sense of enumerating things of the same nature); rather it evaluates; and it
evaluates not only what is, but also what may be, using money as a way of
taming the future.
This fi rst form of government by numbers was not introduced by states,
but by businesses. Although accounting techniques already existed in antiquity,
especially in Ancient Rome, 18 it was in the medieval era that modern
accountancy emerged, with the keeping of personal accounts and later
the invention of the partita doppia, the double-entry system, by the merchants
of large Italian towns. 19 This system solved the problems raised by
the expansion of credit. Books in which the infl ow and outfl ow of goods
and money were entered as they arose were not suitable for credit arrangements
with suppliers or clients. If I have granted a credit of 1,000 fl orins
to a client, I can never be absolutely certain that I will recover the sum, so
I cannot enter it as an available asset. By the same token, if I have a debt
of 1,000 fl orins with a supplier, it must fi gure on the books, even if these
1,000 fl orins are still in my account. To give a faithful representation of
these operations, merchants therefore opened specifi c accounts: ‘ client ’and
‘ supplier ’accounts for the operations of credit; and ‘ sales ’and ‘ purchases ’
for the corresponding transfers of goods. They then opened more specifi c

Accounting 83

accounts corresponding to the elements of their wealth which could be identifi
ed as a source of expenditure or income. All these books were kept in the
same accounting currency, which could be different from the currency used
for payment. When a sale occurred on credit, the same sum was entered in
the ‘ sales ’and in the ‘ clients ’account. When this debt was settled, the sum
was entered in the ‘ clients ’and the ‘ cash ’accounts. Thus any economic
operation gave rise to at least two accounting entries. This is why historians
regard keeping separate accounts for credit operations as the origin of
double-entry book-keeping.
In the words of the great German historian and sociologist Werner Sombart
— to whom we owe the word ‘ capitalism ’ — ‘ capitalism and doubleentry
book-keeping are absolutely inseparable; their relation to one another
is as form to content ’ .
20 The invention of the double-entry system went hand
in hand with other legal techniques which were also highly successful — bills
of exchange, discounts, endorsements and trusts. When analysed closely, all
of these credit transactions reveal the dogmatic basis on which the market
economy rests: they are all implicitly backed up by a third, who acts as a
guarantor. The normative force invested in numbers through these key innovations
was closely linked to the introduction of algebra in Europe. 21 The
arithmetical and geometric fi gures of equality used by Aristotle to illustrate
his theory of justice only allowed known magnitudes to be compared. With
algebraic equations, equality became a question, and algebra could help
arrive at the numerical value of a certain number of unknowns. 22 Doubleentry
book-keeping exploited these new techniques. It brought within the
sphere of calculation elements which had previously been excluded: not
only the money one has, but all the resources mobilised for one ’ s trade;
not only the value of one ’ s present goods, but also an estimation of future
values. Additionally, double-entry book-keeping gave the legal principle of
equality a new systematising power, since charts of numbers were organised
according to a rigorous principle of equal rights and obligations.

famous for introducing algebra into the West, from Arab scholars. Pacioli also elaborated the
notion of ‘ divine proportion ’(see above, ch 4 , p 72), which he took as the title of a later work
illustrated by Leonardo da Vinci ( De Divina Proportione [1509], French tr G Duschesne and
M Giraud (Librairie du Compagnonnage, 1980)). 22 I owe this insight to Pierre-Yves Narvor, philosopher-scholar and mathematician.
84 The Development of Normative Uses of Quantifi cation

This new form can be discussed alongside the contemporary invention
of the laws of perspective, which conferred a comparable objectivity on
depictions of reality. 23 Tables of fi gures (or, later, statistical tables) can be
regarded as a sort of portrait, an objective fi guration of reality. The French
language already points to this meaning, through its designation of the chart
of accounts as a tableau chiffr é (literally, a fi gured table or fi gured painting).
Michel Foucault famously gives a foundational role to painting in his
‘ archaeology of the human sciences ’ .
24 However, painting is only one way
of projecting an image onto a fl at surface. It should be relativised by two
others: the map and the mirror. 25 ‘ The merchant ’ s mirror, ’a metaphor often
used to describe accounting, and found in the title of Richard Dafforne ’ s
1636 treatise on book-keeping, published in London, The Merchant ’ s
Mirrour, or Directions for the Perfect Ordering and Keeping of his
Accounts,
26 can be regarded as a precursor of our legal concept of ‘ faithful
image ’or fair view. What gives double-entry book-keeping its originality
and power is that fundamentally heterogeneous things, people and operations
are presented as a coherent and homogeneous whole, by the use of a
unit of account which ‘ views ’them all from the same perspective, showing
the relative importance of each one ’ s place in the fi nancial life of the company.
The laws of perspective result in exactly the same ordering effect, since
the size of each object in a painting will be exactly proportional to its distance
from the spectator ’ s viewpoint, irrespective of any qualitative criteria.
Of course, this objectivity is as fabricated in the case of book-keeping as
it is in painting, where the composition will vary according to the spectator
being addressed, and the desired effect. Today ’ s dominant accounting regulations,
which are Anglo-American, have always privileged the viewpoint of
investors; the fi nancial reports accordingly seek to gain their trust, and to
enable them to form an opinion on the accounts. In mainland Europe, by
contrast, the accounting tradition has always addressed the state, particularly
the tax authorities: it is for them that a company ’ s accounts should
appear transparent. And the books would look different again if the privileged
viewpoint were that of the people whose work keeps the company
going. At present, employees are regarded as a liability and an expense. 27
This is one of the reasons for share-price-induced redundancies, which

Managing 85

automatically show up as ‘ value creation ’ , whereas in reality they drain the
lifeblood of a company, sometimes bleeding it to death like an over-greedy
vampire. So, there is nothing mechanical about the recording of numerical
data, not even according to the same accounting standards. The information
is fi ltered through a range of possible presentations, highlighting or playing
down this or that aspect, in a process of window dressing or, at the other
extreme, of ‘ creative accounting ’close to cooking the books. However, none
of this will be visible in the fi nal fi nancial statements and, if well executed,
they will have the persuasive self-evidence of a truth. Unlike scientifi c truths,
which are always a modifi able approximation of the state of the world, legal
truths fi x a certain representation of the world and continue to produce
their normative effects as long as people continue to believe in them. Their
veracity does not depend on fl uctuating empirical data but on the trust they
are able to elicit, in this case, trust in the accounting image presented by a
company regarding its economic situation. If that trust falters, either for
good reasons (too wide a gap between the accounting image and reality) or
for bad ones (a rumour, stock-market panic), then the company ’ s credit will
plummet, as occurred in the Enron scandal.
Double-entry book-keeping has a further crucial characteristic, which
is its application of an unbending principle of balance to the represented
system of rights and obligations. The term ‘ balance ’comes via the Italian
bilancio from the Latin bilanx, used to designate a pair of scales in which
two ( bis) pans ( lancis) are in equilibrium. Everything on the balance sheet
must, precisely, be balanced. The merchant can see at once the state of his
company and the entries he can act on to ensure it does not go under. In
other words, the books present the company as a homeostatic whole whose
internal equilibrium must be respected. The company director must react to
the numerical information given by the accounts, in order to avoid spiralling
imbalances becoming so critical that the company collapses in entropy.
Profi t and loss, from this perspective, are simply indicators which need to
be interpreted in the light of other fi gures. This is why the pressure from
the fi nancial markets to get fi xated on ‘ the bottom line ’ — the company ’ s net
balance — can lead to suicidal strategies, if to increase profi ts one loses the
skills (which themselves are excluded from the company ’ s accounts) which
ensured the company ’ s market position in the fi rst place. This is the slippery
slope on which ‘ fabless ’companies navigate, in their belief that they will be
able to keep on amassing golden eggs while outsourcing the goose which
lays them.

II. MANAGING

In the Roman Republic, the population census which was carried out
every fi ve years ended on a ritual of purifi cation, the lustrum, to mark the
86 The Development of Normative Uses of Quantifi cation

city ’ s rebirth. The two specialist legal experts, or censors, who were entrusted
with this task through a non-renewable mandate counted the citizens
and the goods they possessed, appointed senators, and supervised public
morality. ‘ Census ’and ‘ censorship ’in modern English retain a reference to
this dual function, just as ‘ lustre ’denotes a period of time (fi ve years) as well as
a literal and metaphorical radiance (the Latin l ūstr āre means to purify ceremonially,
to expiate or redeem). Thomas Berns has shown in a recent book
how a long line of early modern jurists sought to have the Roman institution
of the censor restored, among them Jean Bodin, Lipsius, and Montchrestien,
and, on the Protestant side, Althusius. 28 Censors, like judges, were
legal offi cers, but unlike judges, they did not apply the law. Instead, their
task resembled what could be called — without fear of anachronism — public
management, a knowledge-based activity.
The Roman censor ’ s primary function was to provide the sovereign with
knowledge of human and material resources, and thus to contribute to
the country ’ s political economy, dissolving the limit Aristotle had drawn
between the oikos and the polis, and treating state administration on the
one hand, and the management of a company or a family on the other in
the same terms. The most important knowledge provided by the censors
was that of the distribution of wealth within the population, this being,
ever since the Middle Ages, construed as a ‘ mirror of the Prince ’in the same
way as accounting was a ‘ mirror of the merchant ’ . It allowed the monarch
to gauge his own importance and that of his kingdom. The metaphor of the
mirror was also used to refer to the fi rst codifi cations of laws; for example,
the famous Sachsenspiegel, the mirror of the Saxons, a code of laws in
Middle Low German. Whereas the mirror of the laws composed the image
of an ideal order for the sovereign and his subjects to contemplate, the
mirror held up by the censors was supposed to present the kingdom as it
really was. This ‘ mirror of the prince ’became the ‘ mirror of the nation ’a
few centuries later, and continues today in the form of ONS in the UK or
Eurostat at the European level.
Equipped with this knowledge, the sovereign could act on two fronts.
First, he could correct over-large disparities in wealth. Political and legal
thought at the time was particularly sensitive to the fact that such inequalities
were a source of unrest and sedition, and thus a threat to law and order.
Francis Bacon spared no one on this point, comparing money to muck that
must not be allowed to accumulate if one wants it to fertilise the land and

l ’ é conomie politique ( Paris , EHESS , 1992 ) 143ff .

not pollute the atmosphere. 29 Secondly, the sovereign ’ s knowledge was to
allow the deserving poor to be distinguished from those whom Montchr étien
called ‘ importunate beggars ’ 30 and, more generally enable ‘ banishment
of the vagabonds, the idle, the thieves, the tricksters and the ruffi ans ’ ,
31 in
Bodin ’ s words. To banish is also to make public — one publishes marriage
banns — a publicity which in this case is both a punishment and a way of
making society transparent to itself. In Bodin ’ s time, only individuals were
targeted, but today whole nations are demoted by rating agencies and made
to toe the line by the IMF or the European troika. And information technology
helps realise the vision of a society laid bare for its leaders to observe,
in a way Bodin and the Chinese Legalists could not have hoped for in their
wildest dreams. But might this transparency, Bodin nonetheless asked, lead
to tyranny ?Certainly not, he replied, and for at least two reasons: the honest
citizen has nothing to hide; 32 and besides, this transparency does not
constrain people from the outside, as would a sentence handed down by
a judge, but from within, by encouraging everyone to behave well. Unlike
Justice, who is armed with a sword but who is also blindfold so as not to see
particularities, the budding discipline of statistics has no power to coerce,
but it wants to see absolutely everything. 33
So once again we come upon the fi gure of the government of souls, dear
to both the Pope and the Tenn ô of imperial Japan. The population censuses
in the Bible likewise have a religious dimension, and are to be performed
only under God ’ s instructions, and within the limits He poses. 34 God alone
keeps the register of souls, and King David even regrets that he complied
with God ’ s order 35— but maybe it was Satan ’ s 36— to conduct a census of the
populations of Israel and Juda. The institution of the censor, in encouraging
spontaneous compliance with the rules of a society which had been made
self-transparent, contains in embryonic form all the ingredients of participatory
management. The only elements lacking were the ‘ objective ’images
which today statistics and indicators, after two centuries ’development, can
provide of everyone ’ s activities.
Since the census ’ s primary function was to assess the wealth of the kingdom,
it is hardly surprising that the legislative fi eld in which statistics developed
most spectacularly was taxation. As the historian Jean-Claude Perrot

88 The Development of Normative Uses of Quantifi cation

has remarked, ‘ the overlap of the census and taxation was for many years
the best and the worst motivations for book-keeping ’ .
37 The example he
takes is from the early eighteenth century, and Vauban ’ s research into the
possibility of introducing a royal levy. To assess the potential yield of this
policy, Vauban used two different methods. He isolated a ‘ proportional
mean ’of several measurements of the same object (for example, the surface
area of the kingdom), and he calculated a ‘ mean value ’arrived at by
aggregating heterogeneous data into ‘ a sort of whole ’ .
38 For example, he
calculated average agricultural yields using data from different parishes or
years. Whereas quantities had previously been estimated purely pragmatically
(with the idea of ‘ grosso modo ’ , ‘ taking the good years and the bad ’ ,
‘ all things told ’ ), taxation gave rise to new techniques of quantifi cation, and
new entities such as ‘ sorts of wholes, ’which then became operative categories
in law.
The normative force of these new categories increased considerably when
the state acquired powerful tools for carrying out censuses, and for calculating
and comparing quantifi ed data on the country ’ s population. The
two types of mean identifi ed by Vauban — an objective average, calculated
from many imperfect observations of the same object, and a subjective average,
derived from the aggregation of heterogeneous objects — could then be
combined. Adolphe Qu é telet who, despite his profession as an astronomer,
is regarded as one of the founding fathers of statistics and sociology, used
these methods. When the exhaustive data he had gathered on the number of
births, deaths, marriages, crimes, etc, was plotted on a graph, there appeared
regularities which, for example for statistics of fertility, had the form of a
bell (the ‘ Gaussian function ’ ): the pinnacle of the bell corresponded to the
age of greatest fertility. One hundred years earlier, Johann Peter S ü ß milch,
a Prussian pastor and almoner in the army of Frederick II, had seen in this
type of regularity the expression of a ‘ divine order ’ , which he described as
follows:

The most wise Creator and Governor of the world brings forth from the nothingness
the hosts of humans by creating those He has commanded to live. The Lord
has us all pass in the same way before his eyes, until such a time as each of us,
having attained the goal decreed, deserts the world ’ s stage. Our emergence, our
passage before the Lord of Hosts, and our departure all occur in admirable order.
Our appearance in the land of the living occurs progressively, without precipitation
and according to certain numbers, which are always in a precise relation to
the army of the living and the numbers of the departing. Just before we enter the
land of the living, some of us are struck off the tally, these are the stillborn. But
even this operation occurs in accordance with fi xed proportions. Two facts are

37 Perrot, Une histoire intellectuelle de l ’ é conomie politique (n 28) 147. 38 ibid, 28 – 29.
Managing 89

particularly worthy of our attention concerning our emergence from the void:
20 girls are always born for 21 boys, and the newly born are always a little more
numerous than those who return to dust. This is how the human army continues
to increase slightly, but always in a set proportion. 39

Like all nineteenth-century scientists, Qu é telet abandoned the idea of a
divine order, and used the numerical regularities discovered to construct the
image of the ‘ average man ’whose role in statistics is the same as that of ‘ the
normally prudent and diligent man ’ , or the ‘ reasonable person ’in issues of
civil liability, that is, a standard of normality by which the deviations of individual
cases may be measured. Qu é telet called the regular effects revealed
by numbers ‘ binomial law ’ , but Pearson later renamed it ‘ normal law ’[ ‘ loi
normale’ ]. 40 This shift signalled the emergence of a normality induced from
the observation of facts, which displaced the legality of the legal system, and
hence replaced the subject of law with an object of care, through the institution
of what Foucault has called ‘ biopolitics ’ .
41
The ‘ objective laws ’brought to light by quantifi cation inevitably had an
impact on law. They were based on the supposition of constant causes which
could explain the observed regularities. The inductive method used did not
measure the effects of an identifi able cause, but inferred from the unchanging
nature of certain measurements that constant causes existed. In biology, this
idea of explaining phenomena through quantifi cation was extraordinarily
successful because it held out the promise of discovering laws which would
be as rigorous and unquestionable as the laws of physics. Since legal systems
attach normative effects to the laws of science, 42 they could certainly not
ignore these ‘ normal laws ’ , all the more so as Qu é telet and his successors did
not restrict their quantifi cations to physical features alone, but also calculated
what was called ‘ moral behaviour ’ , and today would be called socio-cultural
phenomena such as marriage, suicide or homicide. It becomes clear that no
simple limit can be drawn between physical and socio-economic features.
Studying the statistics of mortality, for example, shows differentials linked to
wealth or working conditions, such that one must impute social causes to physical
effects. Research of this kind, as carried out, for example, by the doctor
Louis Ren éVillerm éin the fi rst half of the nineteenth century, encouraged the

adoption of the fi rst social laws, which were introduced to tackle the relative
over-representation of death and disease among the working class. 43 The statistical
measurement of the specifi c physical risks run by certain categories of
the population was thus pivotal in the birth of social legislation, which was
the fi rst area to respond to the social differences revealed by quantifi cation.
The use of the term ‘ social ’here, to qualify a new branch of law, implied
a new legal representation of society. ‘ Society ’ , as conceived in the French
1789 Declaration, was an ideal homogeneous body composed of free and
equal persons (even if this ideal was already compromised by the exclusion
of women from universal suffrage and, later, when voting was linked to a tax
threshold, the exclusion of the poor). The only political arithmetic to have
legal validity was therefore elections — one person, one vote: in Tocqueville ’ s
words, ‘ the notion of government has been simplifi ed. Numbers alone make
laws and the law. Politics has been reduced to a question of arithmetic ’ .
44
The ‘ society ’sketched by social law is quite different. It is not a homogeneous
political body, but a ‘ sort of whole ’ , to borrow Vauban ’ s words,
composed of heterogenous and also dysfunctional elements, as revealed by
statistical studies and the new discipline of sociology. This ‘ whole ’cannot
survive without legal measures to support the most vulnerable, above all
working-class women and children. This is why the jurist Louis Josserand
gave the name of class law to what was otherwise known as ‘ workers ’law ’
or ‘ industrial legislation ’ ,
45 implying that the physical and spiritual hardships
of this new class were not regarded as facts of nature, but as the consequences
of the industrial revolution. Social legislation was thus built on
the conviction that material inequalities such as illness, accidents, or life
expectancy, but also inequalities in ways of life, had socio-economic causes.
At the same time, but inversely, socio-biology and racial biology attributed
physical causes to social phenomena. This was the direction taken by
Francis Galton (1822 – 1911), a cousin and admirer of Darwin, and one of
the inventors of biometrics and eugenics, who sought to relate the distribution
of physical, intellectual and spiritual qualities revealed by statistics to
natural selection. He advocated eugenicist legislation, to improve the human
species by encouraging the reproduction of the fi ttest and the most capable,
and the progressive elimination (through sterilisation) of those whom the
‘ normal law ’categorised as deviants. 46 Nazi Germany was certainly not the
only country to pass laws designed to eliminate the ‘ unfi t ’ ; this occurred

in the United States and in almost all the Protestant countries of Northern
Europe, with the remarkable exception of the United Kingdom. Many progressive
thinkers viewed the successful opposition to these laws mounted in
the Catholic countries of Southern Europe as a sign of a reactionary attitude
going against the movement of history. In some Western countries this
eugenicist and racial legislation remained in place long after the end of the
Second World War. In the US, racial laws were abolished only in 1964,
and the eugenicist legislation in Sweden remained in force until 1976. An
estimated 63,000 mentally ill and ‘ socially maladjusted ’people (90 %of
whom were women) were sterilised against their will in application of these
eugenicist laws in Sweden as from 1934. 47
Both these ways of articulating physical and socio-economic data, as
revealed by statistics, supposed that society was a whole, a social body,
whose laws of functioning can be elucidated by quantifi cation, and whose
malfunctions can be corrected through legal measures. The social sciences,
beyond their diversity and their divisions, all defi ned themselves in relation
to this new object called ‘ Society ’with a capital S, a totality which could be
contemplated from the outside using the same methods of quantifi cation as
the natural sciences. The social sciences also sought to found a legal order
on the ‘ normal laws ’which Society had been shown scientifi cally to obey.
Legal qualifi cation and statistical qualifi cation were thus interwoven, since
the law was grounded in ‘ truths ’revealed by the quantifi cation of economic
and social facts. ‘ Qualifi cation ’ , in both cases, means relating facts to categories
of thought, but there are important differences between this operation
in law and in statistics.
All judicial decisions are based on prior operations of legal qualifi cation.
The judge who is called upon to decide, for example, whether the suicide
of an employee in his home can be qualifi ed as a work accident has to
examine — and possibly broaden — the notion of ‘ industrial accident ’ . This is
what the French Cour de cassation did when it ruled that ‘ an accident occurring
at a moment when the employee is no longer in subordination to the
employer constitutes a work accident if the employee proves that it occurred
due to the work ’ .
48 The fact that the employer did not take the necessary
steps to ensure that the working relationship responsible for the suicide
did not deteriorate was qualifi ed in the same decision as ‘ gross negligence ’ ,
with the result that the widow and orphans gained rights to ‘ full redress ’ .
The judge decides on the qualifi cations — here, ‘ work accident ’ , ‘ gross
negligence ’ — only after hearing an adversarial debate between the two parties
[ audi alteram partem]. This debate can be re-opened on appeal or in the
Supreme Court. Only at the end of this process will a legal truth be fi xed, as

92 The Development of Normative Uses of Quantifi cation

case law. And even then, this truth can be challenged if a judge goes against
precedent or if Parliament intervenes. In other words, legal qualifi cation
operates in the refl exive medium of language, and thus remains indefi nitely
open to reinterpretation.
Statistical qualifi cation is less easy to grasp because it works behind the
scenes and does not follow procedural rules in the way legal qualifi cation
does. Despite this, qualifi cation is a necessary stage in the production of a
statistical image of social facts because one cannot quantify what has not
been qualifi ed. Statisticians talk of ‘ conventions of equivalence ’to refer to
the aggregation of heterogeneous elements into a single whole. 49 This procedure
is necessary because every enumeration must begin by defi ning what
is being counted. To count apples, I must begin by distinguishing them from
pears and plums. And if they are for immediate consumption, I shall have
to separate the ripe from the unripe and the rotten apples. Since, not unlike
us humans, apples do not change overnight from immaturity to maturity,
and on to the disorders of old age, I shall have to decide like a judge how
to qualify each of my apples in order to single out the edible ones. If I am
an apple-seller, I will be tempted to qualify as edible an apple which a more
demanding client would qualify as rotten. In other words, the qualifi cation
of the objects of a calculation implies a standard of judgment which is not
itself an object of calculation, but which makes the calculation possible.
In some cases, statistics simply adopts pre-existing legal qualifi cations, as
when it counts work accidents or the national population. In other cases,
however, it uses its own categories, which may then carry over into law.
This is precisely what happened with the category ‘ unemployed ’ , which
was a category invented by labour statisticians in the late nineteenth
century. 50 However, the constant is always the construction of equivalences,
so that heterogeneous elements may nonetheless be counted. Although
these conventions of equivalence may be as hotly debated as any issue in the
court room or before parliament, statistical qualifi cation still differs in two
essential respects from the work of a judge. Since statistics are supposedly
the preserve of technical experts, the decisions are not the object of revisable
open debate, and there is no standard procedure by which qualifi cations
may be contested. Secondly, once the element has been qualifi ed, it is used
not to judge but to count, to fi x the facts of the case in fi gures not letters.
In other words, the pronouncements of statistics lie outside the refl exive
medium of language, and this gives them a very particular dogmatic power.
This symbolic power of numbers was reinforced by the use of what are
called Arabic numerals, transmitted by the Arab Enlightenment, although
actually of Indian origin. Unlike Roman or Greek numerals, which retained

semantic traces of a particular alphabet, Hindu-Arabic numerals had the
advantage of being potentially universal (as well as abolishing the distance
between writing and calculation). They can be compared to sinogrammes,
which are understood by Chinese people even if they speak different languages:
they simply have to trace the strokes of the character on a slip of
paper or on the palm of their hand. But the person they address still has
to be able to read sinogrammes, whereas the hegemony of Hindu-Arabic
numerals has universalised the normative force of numbers and realised the
Babelian dream of a language shared by all humanity. 51

III. JUDGING

Another dilemma central to law, which modern methods of quantifying
social facts sought to address from the outset, was how to choose rationally
when in a situation of uncertainty. Legal procedure deals with this, and if
one were to teach only one area of law in all law faculties it should unquestionably
be procedure. The aim of every trial is to prevent a confl ict from
degenerating into fi sticuffs. Legal procedure converts confl ict into litigation,
that is, into a regulated exchange of arguments under the supervision of a
third party who will hand down a judgement binding on all parties. The role
of the judge is to weigh up the arguments in the scales of justice, establish
the truth or falsehood of the facts produced, and take a decision which shall
have the force of law.
The role of the judge is similar to that of a gambler, who also takes decisions
in situations of uncertainty. Rabelais merged the two in his colourful
Judge Bridlegoose, who explains to Pantagruel how he decides on cases by
throwing the dice, ‘ as the custom of the judicatory requires, …and by the
rule thereof to direct and regulate our actions and procedures ’ .
52 Throwing
the dice is entrusting oneself to God ’ s judgement, as Saint Augustine
observed regarding drawing lots. 53 But ever since Canon law forbade
bringing God into settling cases in this way, the search for rational proof
took over. 54 Similarly, the experienced gambler does not simply rely on chance,
but instead tries to calculate the chances of winning or losing before placing
his bets. Pascal ’ s famous wager was directed precisely at this calculating gambler.
If he has not received faith through divine grace, then only he can decide

51 European merchants banned the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals in bookkeeping until the
end of the fi fteenth century, when its use became standard, long after it had started to be used
in mathematics ( cf Vlaemminck, Histoires et doctrines de la comptabilit é (n 19) 54). 52 Rabelais, Le Tiers Livre, Édition de Pierre Michel. Préface de Lucien Febvre, (Paris,

whether or not he should believe in the existence of God. Since he has already
‘ embarked ’on life ’ s journey, he cannot escape this question, but his decision
will be taken in a situation of uncertainty. Pascal shows that he can decide
rationally to believe or not, using the same calculations as at the gaming table.
The mathematical rigour of Pascal ’ s demonstration and its sheer daring (basing
faith on a calculation) is a precious resource for our understanding of the
religious dimension of governance by numbers to this very day. Pascal begins
by showing that certainty and uncertainty are not separated by an unbridgeable
gulf, but are linked by the ‘ proportion of the chances ’ 55 of gain and loss.
In the case of the existence of God, the chance is set at a one in two chance.
All that remains after this step is to apply the amount of the stakes to this
probability: a libertine but fi nite life on the one hand, and on the other, eternal
salvation. The maths holds no secrets, and must lead to rational belief, a truth
of which ‘ all men are capable ’ . One could argue that Pascal does not calculate
everything rationally because he decides arbitrarily that there is a 1:2 chance
of winning or losing. However, any other proportion would have given much
the same result, given that the trump card of infi nity has been introduced
into the equation. At all events, this is a good example of the impossibility of
an entirely self-enclosed calculation divorced from any reference to a value
judgement, a qualitative moment underpinning the demonstration. Calculations
of probability are at once descriptive and normative.
The problem Pascal was trying to solve in this exploration of probability
was in fact a question of law: how should losses and gains be allotted
in the case of breach of an aleatory contract ? 56 As Alain Desrosi è res has
shown, this question cannot be answered without appealing to an arbiter
who stands outside the game and is able to construct ‘ spaces of equivalence
between incompatible, heterogeneous future events which have not yet
taken place ’ .
57 Although calculations of probability can replace the qualitative
operations which a judge carries out in order to arrive at a position
‘ beyond reasonable doubt ’(the judge ’ s ‘ intime conviction’ ), and although
these calculations can thus replace legal procedure, the fi gure of the impartial
third party does not disappear for all that. In making incommensurable
facts commensurable, the third carries out exactly the same type of operations
as those undertaken by jurists when they subsume different factual
situations under the same legal qualifi cation.
Like the judge, this third must fi rst decide on the truth or falsehood of the
facts alleged. In the courtroom, this question is ultimately a matter for ‘ the
prudence of the judge ’ , in the words of Domat, the most brilliant jurist of his
time (and friend of Pascal). 58 Prudence, one of the four cardinal Christian

virtues — the others being justice, fortitude and temperance — is the faculty
of discernment thanks to which actions may be guided by an exact representation
of the truth. The famous sculptures of the tomb of Francis II
of Brittany portray Prudence as a twin-facing fi gure, representing from the
front a young woman holding in her right hand a compass, the symbol of
the measure appropriate to every action, and in her left hand, a mirror. 59
Due to this mirror, she does not simply face the future, but also looks into
herself, for self-knowledge, and behind her to the past. No prudent action
is indeed possible without self-knowledge and the benefi ts of experience,
as this sculpture also shows, on its reverse side, through the depiction of a
pensive old man facing away from us and towards the past.

96 The Development of Normative Uses of Quantifi cation

The good judge (whose jurisprudence is authoritative) is thus one who takes
into account past experience, through self-examination, who is able to
assess the reliability of the evidence presented concerning the alleged facts,
and who can anticipate the effects of his decision. A key facilitator of these
essentially qualitative evaluations is what in French procedure is called the
principe du contradictoire, which means that the judge decides only on the
basis of evidence which all the parties to the trial have been able to discuss.
This is the rule laid down in Article 427 of the French Code of Criminal
Procedure: ‘ The judge may only base his decision on evidence which was
submitted in the course of the hearing and adversarially discussed before
him ’ . The value attributed to a piece of evidence presented to the judge will
depend on several factors: the conditions surrounding it (a testimony under
oath carries greater weight than a simple declaration before a police offi cer),
on the character of the person testifying (the words of an honest citizen
are more trustworthy than those of a ruffi an) and on the credibility of the
facts attested (seeing the Virgin Mary appear is less credible than seeing a
shepherdess).
The founding fathers of calculations of probability — Leibniz, Bernoulli,
and Condorcet — attempted to quantify these types of factors, in order to
give a numerical value to the possible truth of a reported fact. In her Classical
Probability in the Enlightenment, Lorraine Daston cites many examples
of these calculations, as applied in the fi eld of law. 60 Condorcet, in one
of his M é moires àl ’ Acad é mie royale des sciences, arrived at the following
formula to calculate the probability of an extraordinary event reported by
a witness: 61

Let us suppose that u and e represent the probability of the truth of an extraordinary
event and of the falsity of the same event, and that at the same time u1 and e1
express that the probability of a testimony will or will not conform to the truth,
and that a witness has testifi ed to the truth of this event [ … ], the probability that
the extraordinary event declared true really did occur will be:

uu
uu ee
1
1 1 +

and that it is false:
ee
uu ee

1 1 +

Some years later, Laplace arrived at a signifi cantly more complicated formula
in his calculations of the probability (P i) of the truthfulness of a

testimony which claims that a number i was drawn from an urn containing
n numbers. 62 There are four possibilities, he maintains: the witness
does not lie and is right (P1 = pr/n); the witness does not lie but is wrong
(P2 = p[1 − n]/r); the witness lies and is not wrong (P3 = [1 − p][r]/n); and
the witness lies and is wrong (P4 = [1 − p][1 − r]/n: L). This gives the following

Formulas of this sort already give substance to the dream of replacing
the judge, who decides impartially on the truth of an alleged fact, with a
calculating machine. 63 They prefi gure the role of computers in regulating
the fi nancial markets through governance by numbers. Calculations of
probability also embody a change in the hierarchy of values by privileging
considerations of utility over knowledge in the face of uncertainty.
Pascal ’ s wager already demonstrates this inversion, insofar as his libertine
has no interest in fathoming the mysteries of existence, all he wants is to
maximise his winnings. Through calculation, he can evade both the abyss
of a world devoid of sense, and the absoluteness of a world over-saturated
with sense. Thus purged of any metaphysical qualms, he can live his life
in the dimension of the gambling table, which knows neither heights nor
depths. This shift in values separates Greek investigations — centred on the
contemplation of the world — from our own, which have to prove their
usefulness. Usefulness is indeed what gave statistics its momentum: society
is constructed as an object of knowledge only in order to make it easier
to manage. Ren éThom has argued that at the turn of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, the mathematics of control supplanted the mathematics
of intelligibility, due to the professionalisation of the activity of the
scholar or scientist: ‘ Armed with the certainties of science, the enlightened
man gradually transformed into what today we would call a technocrat ’ .

IV. LEGISLATING

The fi rst calculations of probability bear this tendency out, in that they did
not confi ne themselves to establishing certains facts, but additionally sought
to formulate the rules governing these facts. Calculations of probability thus
overstepped the limits of stating what is, and concerned themselves with
what should be. They did not simply describe, they prescribed.
The legitimacy of probability calculations as a basis for a legal decisions
was fi rst debated in the context of a public health issue: the question of
whether inoculation against smallpox should be made obligatory, as a preventive
measure. 65 It was clear that this would reduce the incidence of the
illness as a whole, but the inoculation had also caused the death of a number
of people vaccinated. On the basis of the patchy statistics existing at the
time, the risk was evaluated at 1/300. When Daniel Bernouilli presented a
paper to the Academy of Sciences on the subject in 1760, he recommended
applying a formula similar to the one used for calculating one ’ s chances of
winning at the lottery. Since the results gave an increased life expectancy of
about three years for those inoculated, he implicitly recommended inoculation
for everyone. The case was hotly debated. Bernouilli ’ s argument for
inoculation was echoed by most of the enlightened minds of the time, especially
Voltaire, and the issue was framed as a confl ict between the forces of
progress and of reaction, where progress meant adapting the government of
men to the facts of science. 66 Among the philosophes, only d ’ Alembert came
out against, arguing that one could not apply to a problem where human
lives were at stake a calculation based on incomplete data. 67
Since then, the questions raised by this famous controversy have not gone
away. Public health policy is still obliged to take into account the two facets
of illness, as a quantifi able social fact and as a singular event in a person ’ s
private life. In the nineteenth century, hygenicist doctors advocating a
‘ numerical method ’which standardised care on the basis of medical statistics
fought it out with doctors who set store by clinical experience and
individualised discussion with the patient. Claude Bernard, who was critical
of the numerical method, accused it of treating conditions ‘ on average, ’
instead of using in-depth knowledge of the particular determinations of the
illness. 68 The fact that the primary factors of illness appeared to be physical
Legislating 99

69 cf Daston, Classical Probability in the Enlightenment (n 2) 175ff. 70 This was the main lesson drawn by European law from the fi nancial crash of 2008.
See the ‘ Solvency II ’Directive 2009/138/EC of 25 November 2009, on access to the business of
Insurance and Reinsurance, and their practice. 71 Ewald, L ’ É tat providence, (ch 4 n 31) 143ff.

doubtless helped justify the use of calculations of probability to decide on
preventive or other treatments, since it seemed legitimate to accept statistical
regularities which derived from the unchanging and universal laws of
the physical world. This is why the fi rst applications of probability calculations
to legal issues all concerned physical phenomena, particularly mortality,
which the development of statistics could represent in the form of
quantifi ed tables. The ‘ Galilean sciences ’ , which are also based on measuring
regularities observed in nature, are not so different. Techniques such as
life insurance and life annuities, which were still assimilated to games of
chance in the seventeenth century — and particularly blameworthy ones at
that, because they played with an individual ’ s life — tended to be considered,
by the nineteenth century, as a sign of forethought, which the authorities
would do well to foster in the venerable minds of the pater familias.
The legitimation of probability calculations started with a Gambling Act
in the UK, passed in 1774, which made the interests of the person insured
into the criterion by which to distinguish between insurance (legitimate)
and a bet (legally void). 69 John Law, and the crash of his system insuring
lottery losses, was fresh in people ’ s minds. And in order to decide whether
the insurance contract was ‘ in the interests of the person insured ’ , the question
posed was: does it imply the long time of foresight, or the short time
of speculation ?This same question could helpfully be applied today, if only
there existed some genuine determination to regulate the fi nancial markets.
For everything points to the fact that insurance on the fi nancial markets has
become speculative in the way that led to its being banned until the eighteenth
century. The lifting of this ban — a change which enabled the construction
of the modern Social State — was not unconditional. The generalisation
of social statistics seemed to transform uncertain events into calculable
risks, but these calculations were still screened by a principle of prudence.
This principle cannot itself be an object of calculation because it applies
to the essential function of insurance and not just the extent of particular
fi nancial reserves. In other words, the principle of prudence should oblige
one to set solvency ratios 70 and limit the activities of insurance to exclude
speculative operations.
The importance of insurance in the construction of the social state is
unquestionable, but its precise role merits closer analysis. Fran ç ois Ewald,
in his book on the birth of the welfare state, examines the debates which
led to the inclusion of insurable risk within legal liability. 71 This marked a
legal turning-point, the beginning, he argues, of a society which had become

totally objectifi able and transparent to itself, regulated by norms rather
than governed by law. He calls it a ‘ society of insurance techniques ’[ une
soci é t éassurantielle]. This reading leads him to deny any essential difference
between social insurance and private insurance. There is no good reason,
he argues, to oppose them ‘ because both use the same techniques of risk,
and both proceed by pooling and sharing out the burden of these risks’.
Thus one could say that within the vast fi eld of ‘ social ’security, that is, of
security which is mutualised through insurance, what we usually call ‘ Social
Security ’is but one part. 72 The concept of a society of insurance techniques
thus leads to the conclusion that social insurance and private insurance are
functionally equivalent. Both types ‘ pool ’risks and use the same actuarial
techniques, such that private insurance would be perfectly capable of covering
those risks today covered by social security. From there, it is a small step
to maintaining that the choice between the two should depend ultimately
on their relative cost, set by the market. This step was taken recently by
the Court of Justice of the European Union, when it stated, in a decision of
15 July 2010, that ‘ preservation of [those] elements of solidarity is not inherently
irreconcilable with the application of a procurement procedure ’since
‘ the pooling of risks, upon which any insurance activity is based [ … ] can be
ensured by a body or [a] undertaking ’ .
73 The case involved the requirement
that the social partners turn to the insurance market for the management
of a pension fund established by a collective agreement. A draft European
directive of 2012 on public procurement similarly included this requirement,
regarding ‘ obligatory social security ’ . The political uproar this caused
obliged the Commission to withdraw the provision. 74
The notion of a society of insurance techniques cannot, however, do justice
to the scope and complexity of the legal changes brought about by
the quantifi cation of social facts. As regards the scope: insurance is only
one aspect of the shift from faith in persons, operative at the very heart
of institutions, to faith in numbers. 75 It is a shift clearly visible today in
insurance contracts, for which statistical risk assessments have progressively
supplanted prudent examination of the situation of each candidate. 76
But already in the nineteenth century this movement was emerging in fi elds
as diverse as medical practice and public administration. Quantifying social
facts lends them an appearance of objectivity, and makes them commensurable
on the scale of the planet. Belief in numbers can thus foster the hope

that another type of rule of law may exist, founded not on dogma but on
observed regularities valid for all humankind.
Advances in quantifi cation thus went hand in hand with the idea of a
uniform and universal law, such as Condorcet had advocated, in his sharp
criticism of Montesquieu ’ s legal relativism. His model for this law was that
of weights and measures, a model ‘ which can only displease men of law who
fear to see the number of trials diminish ’ . He justifi es his ideas as follows:

Since truth, reason, justice, the rights of men, and the interests of property, liberty
and safety are the same everywhere, there is no good reason why all the provinces
of a State, or even all States, should not have the same criminal laws, the same civil
laws, the same laws on trade, etc. A good law should be good for all men, just as a
true proposition is true for all. Where in different countries the laws would appear
to need to be different, or have objects which should not be ruled by laws, like
most of the rules of trade, or are based on prejudices and customs which should
be eradicated; one of the best ways of destroying these is to cease to support them
through laws. 77

Condorcet goes on to say that Montesquieu is wrong to evoke the legal
function of Tartar or Chinese ceremonies because just as mathematicians
accustomed to calculations of probability are capable of explaining the rules
of a particular game, so it should be possible to calculate the rules applicable
to all humanity. 78 The vision of law sketched here prefi gures the situation
under globalisation: the deregulation of trade, and the eradication of
regional and national legal cultures in the name of a uniform law. The only
element missing is the natural selection of the fi ttest ‘ legislative products ’
through competition between national legal systems.
Applying probability calculations to social facts has, however, always
met with opposition. The early eighteenth-century mathematician Pierre de
Montmort identifi ed the two reasons why one should beware of these calculations.
The fi rst was that human action does not obey the unchanging
laws of nature (and one is fooling oneself if one thinks self-interest can be
equated with this type of law). The second was the human mind ’ s inability
to grasp all the factors determining any given action. 79 In the following
century, Comte added scathing criticism of ‘ the pretension of some geometers
to render social investigations positive by subjecting them to a fanciful
mathematical theory of chances ’ ,
80 in this explicitly targeting Condorcet

and Laplace. He considered that the high degree of abstraction of mathematics
disqualifi ed it from being used at all rigorously for the close study
of nature.

Can one possibly imagine a more radically irrational conception than that which
takes for its philosophical basis, or its principal method of conclusive explanation,
for all the social sciences, a supposed mathematical theory, in which, as is normal
for purely mathematical speculations, signs being taken for ideas, we attempt to
subject to calculation the necessarily sophistical notion of numerical probability,
which amounts to offering our own ignorance as the natural measure of the
degree of probability of our various opinions ? ’ 81

More recently, this criticism was echoed by Karl Polanyi who attacked
the ‘ immature dogmatism [which] stood guard at the gates of moral statistics,
through which the reality of society had announced its entrance in
the guise of mathematical precision ’ .
82 Quantifi cation is legitimate in the
social sciences only if it is limited to what can be precisely counted, and
does not construct simulations which extrapolate general laws from incomplete
measurements of sets of heterogeneous facts. Fr é d é ric Le Play, an engineer
by training, and his successors, observed this method scrupulously in
their minutely detailed surveys of the living conditions of the peasantry and
working-class populations in different European countries. 83 Le Play had
been struck by the lack of scientifi c rigour in the existing statistical tables
which, he said, ‘ take into account neither the specifi c nature of the individuals,
nor the particular character of their living environments; the offi cial
data thus neglects the principal facts which science must consider in order
to reach conclusions which concern individual existences or different social
categories ’ .
84
This ethno-accounting continues to be practised today by some researchers,
despite the overwhelming dominance of standard econometrics. Instead
of replacing the real with prefabricated statistical categories, this type of
research attempts to understand in all their complexity the systems of values
operative in a human group. 85 For instance, instead of projecting an a
priori notion of value onto poor populations in the context of quantifi ed
anti-poverty programmes, these researchers regard the attribution of value
as a social process which must be understood before one can really improve
these people ’ s lot.

The Law Geared to Numbers: From
the Gosplan to the Total Market

‘ The State forbids by law any organisation or individual from disturbing
the socio-economic order. ’

The Constitution of the People ’ s Republic of China, art. 15

ONE OF THE many convictions capitalism and communism have in
common is that social harmony can be the outcome of a calculation.
Where they differ is that, unlike the Soviet planned economy, ‘ classical
’or ‘ old-style ’economic liberalism considered the law and the state to
be the condition, and not the means, for achieving social harmony through
calculation. Communist regimes used the normative instrument of planned
economic development in their attempts to produce harmony out of quantifi
cation, whereas the fathers of liberalism believed that an essential condition
for a system of spontaneously self-adjusting calculations of individual
interest was the rule of law ( un r é gime de droit), under which the identity
and freedom of persons were guaranteed, property rights were protected
and contracts were enforced. Even as provocative a thinker as Mandeville
never lost sight of the fact that the conversion of private vices into public
wealth required the reign of the law because, as he concluded in his fable of
the bees, ‘ So Vice is benefi cial found, When it ’ s by Justice lopt, and bound ’ .
In other words, classical liberalism still placed itself under the authority of
the law. In order to understand how greatly neoliberalism departed from
this vision, and how greatly it resembles communist utopias, we must take
another look at how the authority of the law was undermined by Soviet
planning.

I. THE LAW DETHRONED

The founders of liberal thought knew full well that the rule of law is a
condition for economic activity. They certainly did not think that a market
was possible without a law to fi x its limits and its rules, and they would
never have dreamt of laws as ‘ products ’competing on a market of norms.
The two parties to a contract may calculate their interests only because a

third is there to guarantee fair exchange, and to settle everything which lies
beyond calculation — not least the identity of the contracting parties. From
this perspective, law is not an instrument serving the cause of calculation,
but rather a prerequisite for its existence. In other words, classical liberalism
still inhabited a three-dimensional universe, in which the dimension of
market exchange had its reference point in the vertical dimension of the
state. This third dimension is necessary not only for contract law, but also
for property law and personhood.
After all, what would a contract look like if it were reduced to a bilateral
bond between Primus and Secundus?It would be nothing but the expression
of the power relation between the two. For there to be a contract, Primus
and Secundus must at least both be equally subject to a heteronomous rule
which they cannot modify, namely the value of the pledged word ( Pacta sunt
servanda). In other words, there is no contract without a law. This in itself
tells us nothing about the nature of that law, which may have a religious or
a customary or a codifi ed basis, but at all events it represents a guarantor
of the pledged word, whether this is called the gods, the community or the
state. And the guarantor is not on the same plane as the contracting parties. 1
So much for the contract. But what would a property right be if it were
reduced to a bilateral relation between an individual and a thing ?It would
be nothing but a simple fact, the fact of possessing a thing, with the risk of
being dispossessed of it at any moment at knifepoint, or by someone just a
bit stronger. This is something we can easily forget if we have the good fortune
to live in a country where we do not risk being mugged at every corner.
In other words, in a country where the law prevails. But one has only to
venture into ‘ no-go areas ’[ ‘ zones de non-droit’ ] for the fi ction of a bilateral
and exclusive relation between myself and my property to be exploded, as
we leave behind the rule of law and enter zones of lawlessness, a ‘ state of
nature ’in which people must be armed and live in gated enclosures if they
are to come out of it alive and with all their possessions. The praemium of
Justinian ’ s Institutes expressed this as follows: one must be armed with laws
for arms to be decorative objects or replaced by the arts and letters. 2
And who would we be, after all, if our identity were not secured by a
heteronomous order which assigns us personhood before the law, and
ensures it is respected ?Whole swathes of humanity had to be reduced to
pack animals, numbered and led to the slaughter before their legal personhood
was at last enshrined as a right, in Article 6 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights: ‘ Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere
as a person before the law ’ . This article implies a ternary structure: if I am

to be ‘ recognised everywhere ’by others, then my identity must be warranted
by a third, whose authority is respected. The immediate refl ex, on
losing one ’ s passport abroad, is to contact one ’ s country ’ s embassy, the sate
which vouches for who one is, in order to prove one ’ s identity to the foreign
authorities, and thus regain one ’ s freedom of movement and the protection
of a legal personhood. One does not need to be schooled in law to have this
refl ex, because institutions are not simply things outside of us; as Durkheim
states, ‘ Institutions bear down upon us, yet we nevertheless cling to them;
they impose obligations upon us, and yet we love them; they place constraints
upon us, and yet we fi nd satisfaction in the way they function, and
in that very constraint. ’ 3
So, from a legal perspective, classical economic liberalism and communism
had one essential difference: liberalism recognised that the rule of law
was necessary for economic harmony, whereas communism used the law
as a tool for implementing a harmony based on quantitative computations.
The unholy union of capitalism and communism which Europe and China
celebrated towards the end of the twentieth century 4 accelerated the process
of gearing the law to numbers. Classical liberals were in no doubt that the
unrestricted pursuit of individual interests could never lead to general prosperity
unless the law set limits on individual greed. But neoliberals took the
legal fi ctions which ground the market to be facts of nature. They mistook a
construct for a given, and extended the paradigm of the market to all areas
of human life, including the law, which is considered to be just another
product competing on a market of diverse norms.
Neoliberalism is thus a utopia predicated on erasing the fi ctional nature
of the legal constructs on which the market economy is based: identity is
treated as though it were solely a solipsistic, self-defi ning individuality;
property as the omnipotent hold of a subject over an object; and contracts
as two-way communication between two subjects. Neoliberalism ’ s world is
composed of contracting particles calculating in real time their individual
interests and exchanging the objects they have in their possession in the
light of this calculation. This is indeed how the fi nancial markets, which are
at the epicentre of globalisation, operate today. They are largely controlled
by computers performing high-frequency trading, which is itself the latest
incarnation of the governing machine. 5

As often happens — with human imagination prefi guring human action —
this ‘ fl at world ’divested of the vertical fi gure of the third which secures relations
between individuals, was fi rst represented in a novel, a philosophical
tale called Flatland, published in 1884 by the mathematician Edwin Abbott. 6
Ota de Leonardis unearthed this forgotten work some years ago and showed
its striking relevance for today, and its prophetic power. 7 As the title indicates,
Flatland is a world reduced to two dimensions, characterised by a sort
of caste system in which the Brahmin are polygons aspiring to the perfection
of circles, the lower cast are represented by triangles, and the intermediary
cast, by squares. Those outside the caste system, and obliged to serve
all the others, are irregular geometrical fi gures. If we try to imagine living
in this two-dimensional universe, in Flatland, we can begin to understand
how tricky social relations must be. Since by defi nition fi gures in the same
plane cannot meet face to face, the most insignifi cant encounter becomes
an extremely complicated and perilous affair, in which mutual recognition
requires prior measurement and calculation of angles in order to identify
the other ’ s caste. This world without verticality — without heteronomy — this
Flatland without a horizon, has no visible limits. In a three-dimensional universe,
the horizon (from the Greek horizein: to set a limit) is precisely a line
which circumscribes our fi eld of vision and in so doing also designates the
existence of something beyond it. 8 Abolishing any such beyond has been
the work of positivism, with its purely immanent approach. It attempts to
free humankind from the fear of the unknown by ‘ identifying the animate
with the inanimate, just as myth identifi es the inanimate with the animate
’ , leading to a new ‘ universal taboo ’ , which Horkheimer and Adorno
described: ‘ Nothing should remain outside because the very idea of an ‘ outside
’is itself the source of terror ’ .
9
The metaphor of a fl at world reappeared around the year 2000, but used
this time without any critical intent. It even became a best-seller, by the
economist Thomas Friedman: The World is Flat. A Brief History of the
Twenty-fi rst Century (published in 2005). 10 In it Friedman rejoiced in
the advent of a world fl attened by globalisation and market forces, in which
all the operators have the same chance of succeeding in a competitive environment
unencumbered by any heteronomous rules. The neoliberal utopia

is precisely this fl at world wholly driven by the immanent laws of the market,
and in this respect it is much closer to communist utopias than to ‘ classical
’liberalism.

II. THE INSTRUMENTALISATION OF LAW IN THE
PLANNED ECONOMY

The construction of a communist society was entrusted not to the law, but
to plans; in other words to a two-dimensional universe in which law was
reduced to an instrument for implementing a computed collective utility.
Harold Berman has aptly described such a totalitarian regime in terms of
a distinction between rule by law and rule of law: 11 Soviet-style planning
illustrates rule by law, and a normative order in which economic life is
ruled by numbers rather than law. This early historical experiment is largely
neglected by researchers today, but its lessons are more than ever relevant
to us. It sheds light on the contemporary hybridisation of communism and
capitalism, for instance in the People ’ s Republic of China and the Russian
Federation, but also in Western countries, whose dependence on the fi nancial
markets has transformed them, in the felicitous terms of the First Article
of the Chinese Constitution, into ‘ democratic dictatorship[s] ’ .
12
So we should re-examine, if only in its broad outlines, the episode of the
Soviet planned economy, which preceded — and in many respects paved the
way for — China ’ s conversion to capitalism under the presidency of Deng
Xiaoping (1904 – 1997). 13 Article 15 of the Chinese Constitution assigns
the state a threefold task: ‘ The State practises a socialist market economy.
The State strengthens economic legislation, improves macro-regulation and
control. The State prohibits by law any organisation or individual which
disturbs the socio-economic order ’ . The exercise of rights is thus protected
by the Constitution only to the extent that this does not disturb the ‘ socioeconomic
order ’ . We fi nd this idea (which has some similarity with the rulings
of the European Court of Justice) already in the Soviet Civil Code of 1922,
whose fi rst article provided that ‘ Civil rights are protected by law except
when they are exercised in violation of their socio-economic destination ’ .
14
In order to know whether this destination is indeed violated, one has to

calculate how useful exercising a particular right is to the Soviet people.
A right ’ s enforceability thus depends on a calculation of its utility which is
external to, and imposed upon, the legal apparatus. If this calculation suggests
a lack of ‘ utility ’ , legal guarantees simply evaporate.
As a result, laws were simply tools — Chinese legalists would have said
‘ utensils ’ 15— with which to construct socialism. ‘ Construction ’was the
USSR ’ s preferred term for designating its political system, rather than
political or constitutional ‘ regime ’ .
16 The word suggests a dynamic onward
march, as illustrated by the Soviet art invented to glorify it. In the USSR,
as in Nazi Germany, the single party was the driving force behind a society
which was to be in perpetual motion. 17 Soviet jurists defi ned socialist legality
not as a stable framework for society, but as a method: ‘ The method
for actualising the dictatorship of the proletariat and the construction of
socialism [ … ] it is always the Socialist State ’ s means of action, and cannot
become an obstacle to the fulfi lment of its historical tasks ’ .
18 The notion of
‘ construction ’conveys at once a process, the extension of a system whose
limits are not yet fi xed, and a technical conception of normativity, pegged
to effi ciency and not to the law ’ s authority. ‘ Construction ’thus defi es the
legal order ’ s aspiration to stability, as represented in the emblems of justice,
which are always motionless Single Party if only to keep the scales straight!
This new ideal of movement was embodied above all in Soviet and Fascist
art, and particularly sculpture. 19 We should note that the term ‘ construction
’has also been used Single Party and still is used Single Party to describe
the European Community, and later the European Union. The ‘ construction
of Europe ’will, in similar fashion, be achieved through an institutional
momentum inseparable from an economic programme. The images on
euro banknotes show this clearly, with schematic doors (symbols of openness)
and bridges (symbols of union) following a line of historical progress
which is refl ected in the value of the note (from fi ve-euro notes in Roman
style to 500-euro notes in contemporary style, via the Middle Ages, the
Renaissance and industrial architecture). ‘ The construction of Europe ’thus
inscribes itself within an imaginary historical movement, but one in which

20 ‘ Le patronat ’refers to employers as a group (or, in the context of labour negotiations, to
‘ management ’in contrast to ‘ labour ’ ). The notion comes from Roman law, and designates the
reciprocal obligations between a freedman and his former master. The latter gives birth to the
freedman ’ s social existence, and transmits him his name, just like a father ( pater). The former
master, now a patron (in French, an employer), owes help and assistance to the freedman, who
owes respect ( obsequium) and certain services ( operae) in return. 21 K Ballod , Der Zukunftsstaat ( Stuttgart , J.H.W. Dietz, 1920 ) . I thank Martine Mespoulet
for pointing out this fi liation. 22 On the economic debates in the early days of the Gosplan, see N Jasny , Soviet Economists

Single Party—unlike the society of plenty promised by Communism —
seems to have no other goal than itself. In a similar development, with the
increasing fi nancialisation of the economy, the body representing French
businesses, the MEDEF, decided to change its name from the familial and
far too reassuring Conseil national du patronat fran ç ais to one evoking the
dynamic force of a Movement ( Le Mouvement des entreprises de France). 20
So we can see how the extremes of Soviet planning on the one hand,
and neoliberalism on the other, converge in gearing laws to calculations
of utility. Where they differ is in the means they employ to do so. Communism
used the central plan, whereas neoliberalism uses the contract.
The body responsible for central planning was called the State Planning
Committee, better known by its Russian acronym Gosplan. The idea behind
it was actually developed much earlier, well before the Bolshevik Revolution,
by a German economist — of socialist and not communist sympathies —
Karl Ballod. In 1898 he published a book called Der Zukunftsstaat ( The
State of the Future), with a preface by Karl Kautsky, which defi ned the role
of state planning in a future socialist Germany. 21 The book went through
many editions and translations, and it infl uenced Lenin, who lacked a clear
idea of how a socialist economy should be organised concretely. At fi rst the
Gosplan, which was created in February 1921, brought together economists
of different schools of thought. 22 As from 1925, it produced annual ‘ control
fi gures ’ , to monitor the activities of state enterprises. 23 It was only in 1927
that the fi rst fi ve-year plan was worked out (1928 – 1932). Unlike the Goelro
plan, which had been adopted in 1921 to set up the USSR ’ s electricity system,
and which defi ned the broad lines of longer-term development (10 – 15
years), the fi ve-year plan fi xed precise targets for businesses, and assessed
their attainment annually through ‘ control fi gures ’ . The Gosplan, the body
responsible for economic planning, was considered to be one of ‘ the USSR ’ s
scientifi c and technical structures ’ . This is another point of convergence
between communism and neoliberalism: the assertion that economic policy
is not the outcome of political debate, but of scientifi c calculation. It led

to the creation by the Bank of Sweden of the so-called ‘ Nobel Prize ’for
Economics, in 1969, a (successful) counterfeit of the Nobel Prizes in physics,
chemistry and physiology. 24 Once the management of economic affairs is
legitimated by science, it need no longer be exposed to the will of the people
and the decisions of the ballot box. 25
The Gosplan was a model for similar structures in other communist countries,
including China. 26 Underpinned by an impressive data-collection and
statistical system, 27 its task was to collect and analyse all the information
from all the economic regions and enterprises, from which it drew up three
types of plan: long-term prospective plans; fi ve-year plans; and annual plans.
The plans gave greater weight to geographical or to industry sector factors in
different periods. The organisational diagram of the Gosplan refl ected this
complexity. Its central bodies were organised both by industry sector, working
with the economic planning departments of the corresponding ministry;
and also by specialised departments (investment, territorial planning, etc).
The central, federal, apparatus had regional and local equivalents, with
a whole hierarchy of different bodies at Soviet republic and local level.
The plans were supposed to refl ect the Gosplan ’ s overall goals while taking
into account territorial specifi cities, in order to achieve balanced development
in all economic regions of the USSR. The procedures evolved over
time, but in the last decades of the USSR, greater weight was given to data
fed up from the local level. 28 ‘ Control fi gures ’ , which were the backbone of
the plan, were produced, comprising relative and absolute magnitudes. 29
These were then fed down through the different industry sectors, republics
and economic regions. Once they had been further broken down and
defi ned by the regional authorities, these fi gures were passed down to company
level, where the businesses prepared their own plans on the basis of
these fi gures and in accordance with the terms of the contracts they had
already signed with their clients and suppliers. All these plans were then fed
back up to the republic-level Gosplan bodies, which synthesised them and

arbitrated between the initial fi gures and those proposed by the lowest
levels. The republic-level plans went back to the central Gosplan, which in
turn synthesised them, and passed them on for approval to the government of
the USSR. This fi nal plan became legally binding, and was fed down, a second
time, in the form of directives affecting the various occupations and regions,
and right down to enterprise level. Each level had to follow the annual plan
prepared for it, with the Gosplan piloting the whole exercise and ensuring
co-ordination with the central planning bodies of the other socialist countries
and of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon).
The accounting system used was the ‘ method of material balancing ’ , which
calculated resources and needs in kind, in order to measure the real fl ow of
products and not their equivalent in money.
In legal terms, all these plans governing the production of goods and services
took the form of unilateral administrative acts binding on the economic
operators, who were all public operators. Contracts were simply the
tools used to implement the quantifi able objectives fi xed by the plans. 30
However, Soviet legal doctrine distinguished two types of contract, depending
on whether it had been imposed on the economic operator or not.
The fi rst were called planned contracts, and they were imposed by the plan;
they prescribed, for example, that enterprise A should be supplied by enterprise
B. The planned contract contained all the obligations that could not
be fi xed at the level of the overall plan. It also constituted a legal commitment
by the parties, a voluntary pledge to carry out the plan. The second
type of contract, called non-planned contracts, was not the result of any
legal obligation to contract, but of the fact that it was economically necessary
or benefi cial to do so in order to fulfi l the plan ’ s objectives. In certain
circumstances, enterprise A could take the initiative to enter into contract
with enterprise B or C. This freedom to contract was very limited, because
the obligations undertaken by the contracting parties had to correspond to
the assignments given in the plan. This sort of contract prefi gures what we
have seen spreading through Western Europe over the last 20 years, and
which goes by the name of the contractualisation of public action and public
services. 31
The shift from liberalism to neoliberalism was precipitated by the implosion
of real communism. The rivalry between Eastern and Western blocks
disappeared, and with it the pressure on Western leaders to introduce welfare
reforms. This is clearly visible in the plummeting number of new international
Conventions adopted since the mid-1990s by the International

and six concerning maritime labour, compared with the 108 conventions adopted between
1946 and 1994. 33 T Todorov , Le si è cle des totalitarismes ( Paris , Laffont , 2010 ) 18 – 19 . 34 The Constitution of the USSR (1936) Arts 4 and 5.

Labour Organisation (with the exception of the maritime transport
sector). 32 And former Eastern bloc countries were already familiar with a
system in which, in Tzvetan Todorov ’ s words, ‘ the Constitution and the
laws are held in low esteem by the Security Forces and the other powerful
fi gures of the regime [ … ] for whom the individual can always get round
the law applicable to all [ … ]. Here everything can be arranged, negotiated,
bought: the exception replaces the rule ’ .
33 Real communism had primed its
populations to treat the law not as the inviolable framework within which
individual interests may mutually adjust, but as one of those very interests
themselves.

III. THE HYBRIDISATION OF COMMUNISM AND CAPITALISM

In order to grasp the process of hybridisation at work here, we must understand
how very different Soviet-style planning was from the legal universe of
Western liberalism. First, the planned economy was predicated on the abolition
of the private ownership of the means of production, and the introduction
of Socialist property ‘ either in the form of State property (owned
by the people as a whole), or in the form of cooperative and collectivefarm
property (property of a collective farm or property of a cooperative
association) ’ .
34 Secondly, the whole society was mobilised to achieve quantifi
ed objectives imposed from above by a government which operated as
a dictatorship. By contrast, the liberal system is based on the privatisation
of the means of production. All individuals are mobilised, as under communism,
but in a generalised competition for the maximisation of their
individual interests. From this the greatest social utility should spontaneously
emerge. Another major difference is that under liberalism, although
governments are regularly exposed to the sanction of the ballot box, the
management of the economy is removed from any political or democratic
scrutiny. The state ’ s role is simply to guarantee the security of the economic
calculations on which the market is based, to protect private property and
to ensure that contracts are honoured. To this was later added the role of
the social state, which was responsible for the longer timeframe of human
life and the succession of generations.
These differences are considerable, and they should not be minimised.
But if we look no further, we shall never understand what the two regimes
had in common from the very start. As products of the same civilisation,

communism and capitalism had the same faith in gaining mastery over, and
possessing, nature. Both saw themselves as bearers of a messianic promise
expressed in terms so similar that it caught the attention of the more lucid
Soviet dissidents once they had settled in the West. 35 The 1936 Constitution
of the USSR defi ned the goals of central planning as ‘ increasing the public
wealth, [of] steadily improving the material conditions of the working
people and raising their cultural level, [of] consolidating the independence
of the USSR and strengthening its defensive capacity ’ .
36 We could compare
these goals with the EU ’ s Lisbon Strategy of 2000, which promised to bring
about, by 2010, ‘ the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy
in the world capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and
better jobs and greater social cohesion ’ . The very same philosophy of history,
whose genealogy Karl L ö with has traced, lies behind these grandiose
pronouncements: history as an indomitable march forward towards a radiant
future. 37
The shared economistic vision of communism and liberalism was supplemented,
with the advent of neoliberalism, by a shared belief that the
law was merely an instrument in what the Chinese Constitution called ‘ the
economic order of society ’ . This instrumental conception of rule by law
had led the Communist regimes to reject the idea of the rule of law. Lenin
dreamt aloud of the ‘ very happy time ’when the power of politicians and
administrators would give way to that of engineers and agronomists, that is,
to an order founded on science and technology, and no longer on the law:

We are witnessing a momentous change, one which in any case marks the beginning
of important successes for the Soviets. Henceforth the rostrum at All-Russia
Congresses will be mounted, not only by politicians and administrators but also
by engineers and agronomists. This marks the beginning of that very happy time
when politics will recede into the background, when it will be discussed less often
and at shorter length, and when engineers and agronomists will do most of the
talking. 38

The founding fathers of Marxism already entertained this vision of a world
purged of politics in favour of technology. For Engels, once the Proletarian
revolution had been achieved, ‘ the government of persons is replaced by the
administration of things, and by conducting the processes of production, ’

which should lead to the gradual extinction of the state. 39 And Saint-Simon
is often read as promising to replace the government of persons with the
administration of things — whereas Saint-Simonian religion taught, on the
contrary, and in accordance with liberal doctrine, that ‘ it is not simply a
question of administering things, but of governing persons, a diffi cult task,
an immense, a saintly task ’ .
40 What characterises neoliberalism, and defi nes
its radical distinction from classical liberalism and its affi nity with Marxism,
is that it likewise envisages laws and the legal order not as stable frameworks
securing life in society, but as pure instruments and products. Hence
the utopia of a fl at world, where the law no longer occupies a dominant
position, as ‘ queen ’ , but is simply a utensil judged by its effi cacy. And if law
is a product, then legislation is a technical issue, not an object of political
debate. This was the spirit in which M Trichet, towards the end of his mandate
as the President of the European Central Bank, described at length and
in detail to an interviewer how urgent it was to privatise public services and
deregulate labour markets, while insisting all the while that these reforms
were in no way a political programme, but simply technical measures for the
good of the ‘ 17 governments and 332 million citizens, of all leanings ’whose
best interests he felt he spoke for. 41 Once one accepts that law is a technical
tool, it must, like any other product, be exposed to competition on a global
market of norms in order for those products best suited to the needs of the
economy to be selected. 42 This is how forum shopping comes to replace the
rule of law, especially in those areas crucial to the social state, such as labour
law, tax law and social security law.
Of course, we should not confuse neoliberalism in the strict sense — as it
was broadcast across the Anglo-American world by Ronald Reagan and
Margaret Thatcher — with German-style ordoliberalism, which stresses
the institutional conditions underpinning the ‘ spontaneous order ’of the
market. 43 The differences between these two contemporary forms of economic
liberalism are signifi cant, and should not be played down. Germany ’ s
legal and economic resistance to the neoliberal tendencies of the EU is
partly due to ordoliberalism ’ s infl uence. Cases in point are the tensions

which have emerged around how the European Central Bank ’ s mandate is
interpreted, 44 and around the Anglo-American versus Rhineland models of
the company. 45 Ordoliberalism ’ s infl uence has also spotlighted the particular
type of governance by numbers which the eurozone has adopted,
with its ‘ control fi gures ’set in stone in the treaties on the single currency. 46
But on the world stage, Germany does not carry the same weight as the
United States. And above all, since ordoliberalism is a contemporary form
of German nationalism, it does not have the same imperialist and universalist
pretentions outside of the eurozone as does neoliberal ideology. The
latter claims to be the expression of universal economic laws which transcend
the diversity of legal cultures. This is why it could so easily replace a
communist eschatology whose telos was to see an identical economic order
reign across the whole world.
So neoliberalism has in common with communism its desire to see the
law geared to calculations of utility. The theoretical difference between
these two utopian visions is that Soviet-style planning believed in a centralised
calculation of social utility as a way of governing the behaviour
of individual economic operators, whereas neoliberalism believes in these
economic operators ’calculations of individual utility as a way of maximising
social utility. Neoliberal governance expunges all trace of heteronomy.
In substituting governance for government, technical regulation ( la r é gulation)
for regulations ( la r é glementation), ethics for morals and norms for
rules, it closes the gap between being and ought-to-be. This gap still existed
in communist planning, which conceived itself as a government by numbers.
The Soviet leaders saw themselves as the engineers of a new society, whose
construction depended on the commitment of the working class labouring
under their orders. The construction of socialism required unquestioning
obedience, and permanent surveillance by the party hierarchy, similar to
the managerial control of workers in a Taylorist factory. Soviet planning,
understood as a tool for the construction of communism, can thus be situated
somewhere between government by laws and governance by numbers.
Although the plan ’ s directives were legitimated by mathematical formulae
rather than by the sovereignty of the law, they resembled laws and regulations
in that they still addressed the citizen from a heteronomic position.
Governance by numbers goes one step further in its dethroning of the law.
As in economic planning, calculation replaces law as the basis of the norm ’ s

legitimacy. But the norm is now akin to a biological norm or a computer
programme, it results from the interaction of individual calculations and it
operates from within. This interiorisation, or eradication of heteronomy,
is precisely what governance means: whereas government implies a commanding
position above those governed, and the obligation for individual
freedoms to observe certain limits, governance starts out from individual
freedoms, not to limit but rather to programme them.
Economists were not the only ones to seek to topple the law by gearing it
to calculations of individual utility. Much of the sociological and philosophical
critique we have seen over the last half century has branded the state and
the legal apparatus — and more generally any form of heteronomy — as ruses
of power and assaults on individual sovereignty. This position is shared by
much of what has been called post-modern thought, and it can be found in
authors of very different leanings, disciplines and specialisms. 47 Their common
ground is that they all confi rm Cioran ’ s remark on the post-war French
intelligentsia: ‘ They all claim to speak in the name of freedom yet none of
them respect the form of government which defends and embodies it ’ .
48
Foucault, for example, discusses law as follows, in his lecture ‘ Society must
be defended ’ :

The essential function of the technique and discourse of law is to dissolve domination
in power and to replace that domination, which has to be reduced or masked,
with two things: the legitimate rights of the sovereign on the one hand, and the
legal obligation to obey, on the other. [ … ]

My general project has been, basically, to reverse the general direction of this
analysis, which has, I think, been the entire discourse of law since the Middle
Ages. I have been trying to do the opposite, in other words to stress the fact of
domination in all its brutality and its secrecy, and then to show not only that law
is an instrument of that domination — that is self-evident — but also how, to what
extent, and in what form the law (and when I say the law [ le droit], I am not thinking
just of legislation [ la loi], but of all the apparatuses, institutions, and rules that
apply it) serves as a vehicle for and implements relations that are not relations of
sovereignty, but relations of domination. [ … ]

The legal system and the judiciary are permanent vehicles for relations of domination,
and for polymorphous techniques of subjugation. The law must, I think, be
viewed not in terms of a legitimacy that has to be established, but in terms of the
procedures of subjugation it implements. 49

Alves da Fonseca, who noted that although the theme of law is omnipresent in Foucault ’ s
writings, it is never clearly defi ned as a concept, nor elucidated theoretically. ( cf M Alves da
Fonseca , M Foucault et al in A Supiot(ed) Tisser le lien social ( Paris , FMSH , 2005 ) 164 ; Michel
Foucault e o direito (S ã o Paulo, Max Limonad, 2002), trad fr Michel Foucault et le droit (Paris,

Raisons d’agir, 1998) 46.

Equating law with a machine which subjects individuals to power can also
be found in Bourdieu, for whom even legal controversies, and the divide
between legal academics and legal practitioners, should not mask the fact
that they are all ‘ objectively complicit ’in the same enterprise of symbolic
domination:

The hostility between the holders of different types of juridical capital, who are
committed to very divergent interests and world-views in their particular work of
interpretation, does not preclude the complementarity of their functions. In fact,
such hostility serves as the basis for a subtle form of the division of the labor of
symbolic domination in which adversaries, who are objectively complicit, fulfi ll
mutual needs. The juridical canon is like a reserve of authority providing the
guarantee for individual juridical acts in the same way a central bank guarantees
currency. 50

Clearly the assimilation of law to a fi nancial product ( ‘ legal capital ’ ) found
a welcome home in sociology long before any theory of ‘ forum shopping ’ .
But we would not wish to reduce the important body of works produced by
these authors to what they wrote on law. Nor should we forget that despite
this general trend in their thinking, they nonetheless defended the state and
individual rights from time to time. For example, in the name of a ‘ critical
morality ’ , Foucault condemned ‘ the infl ationary criticism of the state ’by
those who tar with the same brush the totalitarian state and the welfare
state, and he reminded ‘ all those who share in the great phobia of the state ’
that they are ‘ swimming with the tide ’ .
51 And Bourdieu, who had declared
that ‘ the state is a quasi-metaphysical notion which must be blown to bits ’ ,
52
took a stance, towards the end of his life, in favour of the social state and
the public services, going so far as to write that ‘ the struggle of intellectuals
must be directed fi rst and foremost against the shrinking of the state ’ .
53
But the respect owed to their works and their thought also obliges us to
point out the extraordinarily impoverished vision they have of law, when
we compare it with the profound and subtle understanding which their
great predecessors — Durkheim, Mauss or Gurvitch — had. After all, who
would deny that law is part of the machinery of power and an instrument

of domination ?This affi rmation can hardly be considered to add to our sum
of knowledge. But reducing law to this function most certainly represents a
regression, and shows a lack of understanding of the law as a nodal point
in the domestication of power. Law is most certainly a technique of power,
but it is a technique which binds and limits power, making it a particularly
diffi cult object to think adequately.
As Louis Dumont has shown on a broader canvas, this reduction of political
theory to a theory of power can be traced back to modern economic
ideology. ‘ As soon as hierarchies are abolished, subordination must be
explained as the mechanical result of an interaction between individuals,
and so authority deteriorates into ‘ power ’[ … ]. We forget that this occurs
only on the basis of a particular ideology, namely individualism: thus political
speculation has unknowingly walled itself up within the confi nes of a
modern ideology. Yet recent history has powerfully shown how worthless
this approach is, with the disastrous attempt by the Nazis to found power
only on itself ’ .
54 Beyond the reduction of law to power or domination, it is
every form of social heteronomy which is under attack. Signifi cantly, the last
writings of Foucault were devoted to the self-government of the individual,
what he called ‘ the perfect sovereignty of self over self ’ ,
55 freed not only
from any legal system but also from any moral code.
The dethroning of heteronomy in all its forms is expressed during the
same period in a new normative ideal theorised by Deleuze and Guattari in
A Thousand Plateaus56 as an ideal of networks and mutual adjustment, of
free-fl oating identities and evanescent frontiers. Centred systems, embodied
in territorial states, are set against

acentered systems, fi nite networks of automata in which communication runs
from any neighbor to any other, the stems or channels do not preexist, and all
individuals are interchangeable, defi ned only by their state at a given moment,
such that the local operations are coordinated and the fi nal, global result synchronized
without a central agency. 57

Since the Internet did not yet exist in 1980, this cybernetic utopia employs a
botanical metaphor, the rhizome, which is acclaimed in the following terms:

Unlike trees or their roots, the rhizome connects any point to any other point,
and its traits are not necessarily linked to traits of the same nature; it brings into

play very different regimes of signs, and even non-sign states. The rhizome is
reducible neither to the One nor the multiple. It is not the One that becomes Two
or even directly three, four, fi ve, etc. It is not a multiple derived from the One, or
to which One is added (n +1). It is composed not of units but of dimensions, or
rather directions in motion. It has neither beginning nor end, but always a middle
[ milieu] from which it grows and which it overspills. It constitutes linear multiplicities
with n dimensions having neither subject nor object, which can be laid out
on a plane of consistency, and from which the One is always subtracted (n–1). 58

A rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things,
interbeing, intermezzo. The tree is fi liation, but the rhizome is alliance, uniquely
alliance. The tree imposes the verb ‘ to be ’but the fabric of the rhizome is the conjunction,
‘ and …and …and … ’This conjunction carries enough force to shake
and uproot the verb ‘ to be ’ .
59

This really is a fl at world ( ‘ laid out on a plane ’ ), and not even a planned
one, as in the Soviet era. It is a world without limits (it has no beginning
and no end), it has no central agency or stable identities (neither individual,
the One, nor collective, the multiple); it is a world in which ‘ numbers
become the subject ’ ,
60 bonds are binary (the rhizome is alliance: and …
and …and), and its only law is movement (it grows out and overspills).
Mafi a networks have long been organised along these lines, yet Deleuze and
Guattari believed that with this reticular model they had discovered something
radically new and subversive of the established order, an order symbolised,
in their view, by the verticality of the tree plunging its roots into the
ground. This much-decried emblem was easily comparable with the worst
forms of nazism, they maintained. We had been ‘ too eager ’to criticise the
reduction of human beings to deterritorialised numbers in the universe of
the concentration camps because, ‘ horror for horror, the numerical organisation
of men is certainly not more cruel than their organisation by lineages
or States ’ .
61 They thought they were one step ahead of capitalism when in
fact they were paving the way for its transformation into neoliberalism. 62
Championed by them as a model of radicality, the rhizome could in fact
serve as the logo of globalised capital today. It has no territorial boundaries,
and its economic networks are so powerful that they can indeed uproot the
authority of states, reduce identities to interchangeable numbers, and make
laws useless in the face of the contract — all laws, except that of permanent
change.

63 S Weil , The Need for Roots. Prelude to a Declaration of Duties towards Mankind [ 1943 ],
tr A Wills , pref TS Eliot( London, Routledge &Kegan Paul , 1952 ) 44 . 64 ibid, 41. In this respect, Weil is a successor to Charles P é guy: on 1 August 1914 he wrote
that ‘ for the fi rst time in the history of the world, money is the master, without limit or measure.
For the fi rst time in the history of the world, money stands alone opposite spirit ’(C P é guy,
‘Note conjointe sur M Descartes et la philosophie cart é sienne’ in Œuvres complètes, tome IX:
Œuvres posthumes (Paris, Éditions de la Nouvelle Revue française, 1924) p 57–331. 65 cf J-M Goulemot . Pour l ’ amour de Staline. La face oubli é e du communisme fran ç ais
( Paris, ECRS , 2009 ) .

Such zealous uprooting of whatever is still standing was diagnosed by
Simone Weil as ‘ the most dangerous malady to which human societies are
exposed ’ ,
63 because it gradually extends the proletarianisation which had
fi rst been the lot of workers and colonised peoples to everyone. Weil was
in no doubt that there was no revolutionary potential in destroying roots,
because she understood, much earlier and much more profoundly than
Deleuze and Guattari, that this process was in fact driven by capitalism.
As she noted:

Money destroys human roots wherever it is able to penetrate, by turning desire for
gain into the sole motive. It easily manages to outweigh all other motives, because
the effort it demands of the mind is so very much less. Nothing is so clear and so
simple as a row of fi gures. 64

One cannot metabolise what comes from the outside unless one is rooted
somewhere. And one of the effects of the mass destruction of roots is to
impair this capacity to metabolise situations, with the result that all that
remains is a choice between two forms of stultifi cation: bowing to the victory
of the commodity, or accrediting fantastical identities, which are the
breeding ground of fundamentalisms of all sorts.
So we can understand better, with hindsight, what this post-modern
thought, which was welcomed into American universities under the name of
French Theory, was really about. It operated as a theoretical hinge enabling
part of the intelligentsia to switch from communism to neoliberalism. This
turning-point — from one blind alley to another — was a period of great intellectual
vitality for the greatest of these thinkers. However, when the dust
settled, their disciples lapsed back into Stalinist sectarianism, rallying to the
total market with the same fervour as they had previously expressed for the
‘ Great Helmsman ’Chairman Mao or, earlier still, for the magnifi cent ‘ little
father of the peoples ’and the ‘ great mechanic of the engine of history ’ .
65
But let ’ s not get things out of proportion: the French intellectual scene
in all its greater or lesser brilliance should not receive all the glory — or
opprobium — for providing neoliberalism with its theoretical basis. Some
years earlier, the economists and jurists of the Chicago School had already
got down to it, with infi nitely more powerful effects globally on the making
of law than this so-called French Theory.

Calculating the Incalculable:

‘ If the stakes are high enough, torture is permissible ’ 1

WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK of neoliberalism, laws fi gure
merely as legislative products which compete on a global market
of norms. Their isonomic function disappears; that is, their role
as a shared reference valid for everyone. As a result, neoliberalism faces a
dilemma previously confronted by communist states when they abandoned
‘ the fetishism of the legal form ’ 2 (as Marxists put it): with law transformed
into simply a tool to implement calculations, what can serve as a common
reference by which to harmonise human activity, defi ne each person ’ s
place and judge his or her actions ?Soviet central planning had provided an
answer by enlisting the whole of society, through administrative directives
supplemented by ‘ planned contracts ’ , into the process of achieving quantifi
ed objectives. ‘ Control fi gures ’ , defi ned at the very top and fed down to
individual level, served to assign each person a task and to judge how well it
was carried out. In short, Soviet planning was the fi rst attempt to introduce
what Ren éGu é non has called ‘ the reign of quantity ’ .

No analogous problem arose for classical liberalism, because the contractual
order was subordinated to the sphere of the law. But neoliberalism,
with its aim of creating a society ruled by economics, simply cannot
dodge the issue. The calculation of private interests cannot be referred to
the incalculable value of a categorical imperative, as represented by the law.
Nor can these calculations be measured against ‘ control fi gures ’handed down
from above. This is why neoliberalism has set up a self-referential system
in which calculations of utility ultimately determine how the law is applied.
The Law and Economics doctrine sought to provide a theoretical basis for
122 Calculating the Incalculable: The Law and Economics Doctrine

these self-referential mechanisms. 4 Over the last 30 years it has acquired
paradigmatic status for Western law, infl uencing not only research but also
case law and legislation.
Before analysing this doctrine from a legal perspective, we should make
an important preliminary point. Fortunately, the contribution economics
can make to law is not exhausted by the Law and Economics approach. 5
One could even say that this particular branch of economics provides us
with the least insight into legal thought, because it does not understand law
in all its anthropological, historical and cultural depth, but only as a means
to implement an economic calculation. The Law and Economics doctrine
should thus not be confused with the tradition of political economy, which
aims at describing and understanding the institutional frameworks delimiting
economic activity and not at subordinating these to a model of computational
rationality. The approach of political economy, which is already
present in Veblen ’ s 6 work, was pursued in the United States by what has
been called institutionalist economics. It was a highly dynamic fi eld before
the Second World War, 7 and still has a certain following, albeit very small. 8
It gave rise to a ‘ neo-institutionalist ’school, whose best-known representative
is Olivier E Williamson. 9 Unlike marginalist or utilitarian currents which
are dominant today, institutionalist theory is not predicated on the harmonisation
of private interests, but instead seeks to explore the frameworks
and possibilities of collective action. It is worth mentioning that in France
this theory was taken up predominantly by scholars with a background in
engineering, who sought to anchor economic thinking in the realities of
the productive process. It has given rise to the regulation school, 10 which

emphasises macroeconomic institutional frameworks, and to the economics
of conventions, 11 which is more interested in the strategies of coordination
used by actors of supposed limited rationality in situations of uncertainty.
More generally, many economists are attentive to the non-economic determinants
at work in the creation and distribution of wealth. 12 Beyond their
differences, all these authors agree that, fi rst, an economy has no existence
outside of the societies or institutions of which it forms a part; and secondly,
that we can understand the economy only by looking at the real behaviour
of economic agents and at the law as it stands. These fi elds of research are
essential for a better understanding of the law because their work of contextualisation
is a prerequisite for an insightful legal analysis.
The doctrine of Law and Economics is quite different. It was developed
by Henry Simons and Friedrich Hayek at the Law School of the University
of Chicago in the late 1940s, in close collaboration with economists at
the same university, amongst them Milton Friedman. Its explicit ideological
aim was to combat Keynesianism and state interventionism by defi ning
the legal and institutional frameworks best suited to fostering a competitive
environment. The economic analyses produced there were thus from
the outset conceived as the theoretical basis for a political programme with
global ambitions. The core of this programme was elaborated within the
Mont Pelerin Society, the fi rst international and economically liberal think
tank, which was founded by Hayek in 1947 with funds provided by Swiss
businesses. It is still going strong today. The Society ’ s website describes its
members — top economists, politicians and business leaders — as those who

see danger in the expansion of government, not least in state welfare, in the power
of trade unions and business monopolies, and in the continuing threat and reality
of infl ation. Without agreeing on everything, the members see the [Mont Pelerin]
Society as an effort to interpret in modern terms the fundamental principles of
economic society as expressed by those classical economists, political scientists,
and philosophers who have inspired many in Europe, America and throughout
the Western World. 13

An important link is made here between a neoliberal political position and
belief in the scientifi city of economic analysis. In order to get public opinion
and academic circles to accept this link, the economists in question
managed to have a new Nobel Prize for the Economic Sciences created,
124 Calculating the Incalculable: The Law and Economics Doctrine

14 ‘ The Swedish Riksbank has put an egg in another very decent bird ’ s nest and thereby
infringed on the trademarked name of Nobel. Two thirds of the Bank ’ s prizes in economics
have gone to US economists of the Chicago School who create mathematical models to
speculate in stock markets and options — the very opposite of the purposes of Alfred Nobel to
improve the human condition. ’Peter Nobel, quoted by H Henderson , ‘ The “ Nobel prize ”that

2008. See also the documentary Inside Job (2010) by Charles Ferguson, with Matt Damon, in

in 1969, whose winners have included many Mont Pelerin Society members
such as Milton Friedman, Ronald Coase and Gary Becker. Alfred Nobel ’ s
great-nephew condemned this sleight of hand in 2001, maintaining that in
legitimating the positions held by the Chicago School economists, the Royal
Bank of Sweden ‘ had laid its egg in another bird ’ s nest ’ .
14 When we examine
the Law and Economics doctrine from a legal perspective, we understand
that it is underpinned by a dogma structurally no different from that of scientifi
c socialism: in both cases, law is merely a tool for implementing underlying
scientifi c laws, which occupy the position of a Grundnorm, a founding
norm valid for all humanity. Those who fi rst attacked the Social State in the
name of ‘ the fundamental principles of economic society ’were undoubtedly
just as sincere as the founding fathers of communism. The latter genuinely
believed that economics was a science equal to the natural sciences, and so
they sought to adapt law and institutions to it. But the same cannot be said
for the ensuing generations. As in Orwell ’ s ‘ animal farm ’ ,
15 one can always
fi nd ‘ useful idiots ’who continue to believe in neoliberalism (as previously
in communism). But they do this out of class interests, not zealous faith.
In reality, communism ’ s utopianism produced a thuggish and unscrupulous
Nomenklatura, and neoliberalism has put power into the hands of a no less
cynical, grasping and corrupt plutocracy. 16 This is why the ruling classes —
particularly in post-communist countries — have so effortlessly passed from
one regime to the other. Soviet planning and neoliberal programming also
share the belief that since the economy is based on rational calculation,
it should not be exposed to the vagaries of democratic elections. Recently
the outgoing President of the European Commission, Jos éManuel Barroso
(himself a former Maoist activist), expressed the need for a restricted
democracy, when one of his former colleagues, Mario Monti, was defeated
in Italy ’ s general elections. He refl ected out loud that:

The question we have to ask ourselves is the following: should we determine our
policy, our economic policy, by short-term electoral considerations or by what
has to be done to put Europe back on the path to sustainable growth ?For me the
answer is clear. We should be serious, and not give in to immediate political or
party considerations. 17

The alliance between capitalism and democracy was sealed by the social
state and also by Western competition with communism. But capitalism in
fact has no need of democracy. It has never had a problem with dictatorships,
as long as they respect the market economy. On the contrary, neoliberal
doctrine has always singled out democracy as a source of disturbance
for the spontaneous order of the market. 18 We should not forget that the
place where the Chicago School fi rst tested its theories was in Chile under
Pinochet ’ s dictatorship. 19
Unlike the fi rst economic analyses of law, the Law and Economics doctrine
claims to encompass the whole legal order, and not simply the legal
rules governing trade and industry. This extended scope corresponds to the
tendency of economists to defi ne their discipline not by its object (the production
and distribution of wealth), but by its method, which can supposedly
reveal the profound motivations of human behaviour in every area of
life, and produce a system of rules to account for this behaviour. A book
by Gary Becker, who was awarded this so-called Nobel Prize for Economic
Sciences in 1992, bore the unambiguous title of The economic approach to
human behaviour,
20 and theorised this shift from object to method. The call
on which it ended, to link economics to biology, was heard loud and clear,
to judge by the success of neuro-economics, today ’ s version of the recurrent
attempts since Francis Galton to ground human behaviour ultimately in
biology. 21 Economics thus defi ned itself as a total science, capable of analysing
in terms of the market all aspects of human life, whether family life (the
marriage market), politics (the electoral market), intellectual endeavour (the
market for ideas) 22 or religious life (the market of religions). 23
The Law and Economics doctrine is just one corner of this vast project.
In its descriptive aspects it relies on some very old legal practices,
which are nothing but plain common sense. Cost – benefi t analysis, for
instance, was introduced in the nineteenth century by the state corps of
engineers, in the US as well as in France. 24 As for how judicial decisions
may encourage diligence or discourage negligence, the idea is probably as

old as the judgement of Solomon. But what really characterises this doctrine
is its aim to derive from such particular practices generally valid norms to
which all legal systems must conform. These normative ambitions are perfectly
explicit, and the doctrine ’ s infl uence, initially relayed by international
economic bodies, was and still is considerable at all levels of law-making.
There one can fi nd, intact, the faith in a numerically computed social harmony,
and in the possibility of realising the Platonic dream of a city state
ruled not by human laws in their inevitable arbitrariness and imperfection,
but by a royal science capable of securing the government of men through
knowledge of numbers.
From its origins in the United States, with the publication of Richard
Posner ’ s pioneering work, Economic Analysis of Law, in 1972, 25 this doctrine
spread to France via the Canadian legal scholars Ejan Mackaay and
St é phane Rousseau. 26 It has met with extraordinary success, 27 generating
such mountains of secondary literature that no exhaustive account of it is
possible. 28 Its different advocates share a belief in a certain number of theories
and principles, which we explicate below, all of which justify a normative
order based entirely on calculation.

I. GAME THEORY

The idea that calculation can replace judgement has a long history, at least
since Pascal ’ s wager and probability theory. 29 Its popularity peaked in the
late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and then declined, under fi re
from the positivists who criticised it as, in Comte ’ s words, ‘ offering our
own ignorance as the natural measure of the degree of probability of our
various opinions ’ .
30 Yet even enthusiasts such as Condorcet and Laplace
applied it only to situations resembling games of chance, where players calculate
their chances of winning or losing without any ethical stakes being
involved. In other words, they certainly never considered that society as a
whole, and the economy, could be a vast gaming hall or casino. Only when
economics decided that game theory could be applied to every situation of
Game Theory 127

31 Game theory was systematised by Oskar Morgenstern and John von Neumann in
1944 (in Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (Princeton University Press, 1944)). The
so-called ‘ Nobel Prize ’in economics is regularly awarded to authors who work within this
theoretical framework, which has become something of a paradigm in the economic sciences
today. For an overview, cf G Giraud , La th é orie des jeux, 2nd edn( Paris , Flammarion , 2009 ) .
And for a legal approach, see M van de Kerchoveand F Ost , Le droit ou les paradoxes du jeu
( Paris , PUF , 1992 ) .

uncertainty was the idea of the limited legitimacy of probability calculations
overturned. 31
Game theory, and one of its best-known examples, the Prisoner ’ s Dilemma,
is familiar even to beginners in economics. In this dilemma, invented in 1950
by Tucker, two prisoners, charged with the same crime, are each encouraged
separately to betray the other in return for the promise of the accuser ’ s
acquittal (sentence = 0) and a heavy sentence (= 20 years in jail) for the
one accused. If both refuse to collaborate, each will receive a light sentence
(= 1 year). If each betrays the other, each will receive a moderate sentence
(= 5 years). This situation can be compared to a ‘ game ’in which each prisoner
must optimise his situation, but this optimisation depends on the decision
taken by the other party. If each relies on calculation, each will betray
the other, whereas the optimal solution would have been that each refuses
to collaborate. This is meant to demonstrate that strategies of cooperation
grounded in a contract are more effi cient at producing collective utility than
is non-cooperation between agents acting under a common law.

performed out of a sense of justice, duty or honour. There is no place in this
game theory for Jean Moulin ’ s heroism, nor for all those who, for better
or for worse, hold certain values in greater esteem than their own life. The
marginalist or utilitarian economics on which this theory rests must pretend
these values do not exist, and work with an incredibly impoverished notion
of ‘ game-playing ’ , understood as quantifi cation of the stakes involved, and
stripped of any anthropological depth. 32 From a legal standpoint, the extension
of game theory to every situation of uncertainty implies a universe
entirely governed by contract, in which individuals are driven by two forces
dear to the Chinese legalists: fear and greed. 33
In the terms of game theory, optimal outcomes, understood as the sum of
individual utilities, are achieved only by the use of contracts, whereas noncooperation
between agents gives negative results; had the two prisoners
made a pact of mutual non-denunciation, each would have come out of it
better. This theory not only justifi es off-the-record dealings, but more generally
provides the basis for ‘ the contractualisation of society ’ . Since appealing
to the law results in non-cooperation between individuals, one would
do better to generalise use of the contract, which enables individuals to
optimise their utility on a case by case basis, and thus to optimise collective
utility.

II. AGENCY THEORY

One extension of game theory which directly affects the realm of law is
agency theory. It focuses on situations in which the optimal result, which
is supposed to be produced spontaneously by the contractual relation, is
compromised by an asymmetrical distribution of information between the
contracting parties. This occurs whenever a contract creates an ‘ agency relationship
’ , that is, whenever there is ‘ a contract under which one person (the
principal) engages another person (the agent) to perform some service on
their behalf which involves delegating some decision-making authority to
the agent ’ .
34 An ‘ agency relationship ’is a broad notion applicable indifferently
to the employment contract, the relation between shareholders and
company directors, or to situations of delegation. It goes without saying
that each party in these relationships is presumed to be motivated exclusively
by egotistical concerns. The risk is that agents may exploit the leeway
they have in carrying out their tasks to serve their own rather than the
principal ’ s ends. Agency theory claims that such problems can be solved,

once again, by contractualisation, and notably by giving the agent a fi nancial
incentive to produce the most profi table results for the principal. 35 This
theory provided the doctrinal basis for the trend in offering stock options
to top business managers, and in fi xing salaries individually. As is often the
case with the economic analysis of law, it is tempting to see this doctrine
simply as a slightly naive formalisation of what has long been common
knowledge and practice. However, it also isolates the solutions proposed
from their contexts and gives them a generalisable normative force. In other
words, the theoretical innovations introduced by agency theory are as meager
as their normative impact is huge.
For example, agency theory was central to the doctrine of corporate governance,
understood as the generalisation throughout commercial law of a
reductive idea of the business enterprise as the property of its shareholders. 36
Of course this idea has no serious legal grounding, because shareholders
have never owned anything except their shares. 37 But it was used to contest
the idea that a business enterprise is an economic entity whose freedom of
action should be secured against shareholders and employees alike, while
both should have the right to monitor together the directors ’decisions.
The application of agency theory has resulted in subjecting companies to the
snapshot time of the fi nancial markets, thus ruining precisely their entrepreneurial
ability, which is predicated on the longer timescale of a collective
project. 38
Applying agency theory to the employment contract also has deleterious
effects because it inverts the founding perspective of labour law. The law ’ s
function becomes the protection of employers from the power of employees
rather than the protection of employees from the power of employers.
We have seen a panoply of mechanisms developed over the last 30 years to
destroy the individual and collective autonomy of employees. They have
been applied up and down the salary scale, but obviously in different forms.
At the top, salaried company directors are dissuaded from pursuing the
business ’ s long-term interests — which might confl ict with short-term profitability
— by pegging their fi nal pay to shareholder profi ts through devices
such as stock options. To keep employees lower down the scale from protesting,
the national and industry-level safeguards provided by the Fordist
compromise have been reduced. So-called ‘ atypical ’[ atypique] and insecure

time [ les accords emploi-comp é titivit é ] are all examples of this inversion
of labour law ’ s primary function, since they ultimately shift economic risk
from employer to employee.

III. THE ‘ COASE THEOREM ’AND THE THEORY
OF PROPERTY RIGHTS

The American economist Ronald Coase wrote an important book published
in 1937, The Nature of the Firm, on the economics of businesses.
He demonstrated persuasively that fi rms will decide to carry out an
economic operation within the fi rm, or else through the market, on the basis
of the transaction costs — fi nding partners, invitations to tender, negotiation,
and so forth — involved in the latter. Building on this work, he published
an article in 1960 called ‘The Problem of Social Cost’, which is often considered
to be the founding text of the new economic analysis of law. 39 It
concerns the legal mechanisms required to mitigate what are called businesses
’ ‘ negative externalities ’ , that is, the harm they cause their environment.
Coase claims to show that if transaction costs are reduced to zero, it is
always more effi cient to settle this problem of externalities through private
arrangements than by appealing to the law or regulations. To prove this, all
one need do is frame the problem in terms of competing rights-bearers and
not liability for damage.

The failure to develop a theory adequate to handle the problem of harmful effects
stems from a faulty concept of a factor of production. This is usually thought of as
a physical entity which the businessman acquires and uses (an acre of land, a ton
of fertiliser) instead of as a right to perform certain (physical) actions.

If factors of production are thought of as rights, it becomes easier to understand
that the right to do something which has a harmful effect (such as the creation of
smoke, noise, smells, etc.) is also a factor of production. Just as we may use a piece
of land in such a way as to prevent someone else from crossing it, or parking his
car,or building his house upon it, so we may use it in such a way as to deny him a
view or quiet or unpolluted air. The cost of exercising a right (of using a factor of
production) is always the loss which is suffered elsewhere in consequence of the
exercise of that right — the inability to cross land, to park a car, to build a house,
to enjoy aview, to have peace and quiet or to breathe clean air.

It would clearly be desirable if the only actions performed were those in which
what was gained was worth more than what was lost. 40
The ‘Coase Theorem’ and the Theory of Property Rights 131

41 ‘ It is necessary to know whether the damaging business is liable or not for damage caused
since without the establishment of this initial delimitation of rights there can be no market
transactions to transfer and recombine them. But the ultimate result (which maximises the
value of production) is independent of the legal position if the pricing system is assumed to
work without cost ’(R Coase, ‘The Problem of Social Coast’, (n 39) 8). 42 In US law, a ‘ circuit ’is the area, covering several states, over which an appellate court
has jurisdiction. 43 Kirat, É conomie du droit (n 5) 73.

If, for example, a company pollutes a river, the legal issue would not be
regulating its activity but rather how to settle competing rights: the right to
produce and the right of others to fi sh. The optimal solution proves to be
a private arrangement between polluters and fi shermen. If the gain for the
business from its polluting activity is 1,000 and the loss for the fi shermen is
200, this arrangement would take the form of the fi shermen selling the business
a ‘ right to pollute ’in return for a sum set somewhere between these two
fi gures. Failing an agreement, the case goes to court where the judge, after
a ‘ cost – benefi t ’calculation, redistributes the rights between the two parties.
Adjusting private utilities should thus result in a maximisation of public
utility, independently of how the rights are distributed between the parties,
which fi nally proves insignifi cant. In Coase ’ s words:

It is necessary to know whether the damaging business is liable or not for damage
caused since without the establishment of this initial delimitation of rights there
can be no market transactions to transfer and recombine them. But the ultimate
result (which maximises the value of production) is independent of the legal position
if the pricing system is assumed to work without cost. 41

This idea was developed further by Richard Posner, who is generally
acknowledged as the founder of the Law and Economics doctrine. Posner
was a professor at the Chicago Law School as well as occupying a highranking
position in the American legal system (he was a judge of the appeal
court for the seventh circuit). 42 In his view, the judge ’ s function is not to
distribute goods justly but to allocate rights to their most productive use.
Posner ’ s view is that justice is the same as what is economically effi cient.
As Thierry Kirat summarises, ‘ the judicial process operates as a machine for
allocating costs and profi ts, and for producing cost – benefi t calculations ’ .
43
Unsurprisingly, when France imported this doctrine, it also imported this
function of the judge. For example, in the presentation of the Economics of
Law Research Unit of the University of Paris 2 (which describes itself on its
English home page as having ‘ the top faculty of law in France ’ ), the idea of
‘ justice ’is distanced through quote marks, the judge is called a ‘ producer of
rules ’and the law, a product.

The research carried out at the Economics of Law Research Unit of Paris 2 seeks
to provide new ideas in legal reasoning, but also economic impact studies. Producers
of rules must be made aware of the economic consequences of their decisions.

mentioned by Alexandre Koj è ve in 1943 in his Outline of a Phenomenology of Right, ed and
tr B-P Frost (London, Rowman &Littlefi eld, 2000).

It is often assumed that the role of the courts is to identify ‘ just ’solutions, and that
the cases have no impact on individuals other than the parties in litigation. But in
reality judgments produce effects for a whole category of similar cases. 44

Rather than dwell on the dreadful platitude of this last sentence — as though
the author were discovering the existence of case law (‘juris-prudence’) — we
shall simply note that this necessary exercise of prudence by the judge is
reduced to the consultation of ‘ economic impact studies ’ . This focus implies
a method of reasoning which has long characterised American tort liability
case law. It was formalised in 1947 by the judge Learned Hand in the United
States v Caroll Towing Co case. 45 Judge Hand had to decide whether the
owner of a barge left unattended was responsible for the damage caused
when it struck another vessel after its moorings had come loose. He based
his decision on a calculation with three parameters: the probability P that
damage would occur; the expected sum L ( ‘ loss ’ ) corresponding to this damage;
and the cost B (for ‘ burden ’ ) of preventing the damage. If the cost B
was less than the amount of probable damage PL, then the person who
could have prevented the damage occurring was guilty of negligence ( N)
and should be sentenced to indemnify the victim. This gave the following
formula, known as the ‘ Hand Formula ’ :

B ≺ PL ⊃ N

The Coase Theorem generalises this extension of individual rights, and
the corresponding restriction of the scope of legal prohibition. The overall
result is supposedly to maximise wealth. It refl ects a legal universe without
a categorical imperative, peopled by contracting particles armed with rights
by which to achieve maximum individual satisfaction. The judge is not
the guardian of the law, but an accountant expected to tot up maximised
individual utilities, case by case, the total being unquestioningly identifi ed
with social utility. As such, the judge is no longer a point of heteronomy,
the expression of an authority placed at n + 1 above the particular interests
of the parties in dispute, but is simply there to ensure that maximum collective
utility results from the parties ’calculations of individual utility. 46
Instead of arriving at a judgment by applying the law, the judge fi ne-tunes
fi gures on the basis of cost – benefi t assessments. This explains today ’ s trend
for using alternative dispute resolution methods, and the generalisation of

arbitration clauses in commercial agreements. When the law is thus atomised
into a cloud of individual rights, disputes call for arbitration not judgment,
guided by the arbiter ’ s own desire to maximise his profi ts on the arbitration
market. 47 And when the arbitration market gets a foothold in investment
agreements between transnational corporations and countries, whole states
are forced to obey the rationale of economic calculation. The inclusion of
arbitration clauses, called Investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses,
in international investment agreements gives businesses the right to go to
arbitration for any employment, environmental or tax legislation liable to
reduce the profi tability of their investment. 48 If these sorts of clauses were
inserted into the investment treaties currently being negotiated between the
EU, and the USA and Canada, they would deal a death blow to national
sovereignty in these areas and to the struggle against the total subjection of
the law to economic calculation. This is why the negotiations have mobilised
so many people, and also why they have been conducted with such
stealth and speed.
In the Law and Economics doctrine, the replacement of mandatory rules
by individual rights goes by the name of the ‘ theory of property rights ’ .
49
Based on Coase ’ s ideas, this theory extends the reach of the market to
encompass not only the exchange of goods and services but also the right
to use these. The market thus conditions individual behaviour through the
play of profi t and loss resulting from exercising, or not exercising, these
rights. The concept of property right is thus not simply about ownership,
but it includes all the prerogatives, the ‘ bundle of rights ’ , attached to the
possession of a good. For example, if I take over a company I do not strictly
have a property right in the skill and experience of its staff, but these are
part of the ‘ bundle of rights ’attached to the thing and transferable with it.
What is really at stake here is the destruction of the separation between laws
and products. On the one hand, legal rules are viewed as ‘ products ’and the

judge or legislator as a ‘ producer of rules ’ ; but, on the other hand, every
product is conceived as a bearer of a bundle of rights. Everything is calculated
in terms of individual rights, and more precisely of property rights,
that is, they are exclusive and transferable.
The legal subject of the Law and Economics doctrine is thus a monad
which cares only about (and for) itself, and which accepts no laws except the
self-imposed bonds of its contractual relations with other similar monads.
It fi ts neatly into our cybernetic imaginary, in which rhizomal networks,
networks of nerves and networks of computers are all part of the same
representation of the world. Law likewise becomes a network, with no vertical
axis or identifi able frontiers. What gives stability and consistency to
the whole is that all individuals are actively seeking to extend their territory.
Legal bonds are just so many contractual threads joining legal subjects
together, who would ideally be undifferentiated beings, without sex, age,
forbears or interiority, and who would all be preprogrammed to maximise
their individual utilities. The incalculable — because in-valuable — principles
which ground the reign of the law have no place here. The values they represent
have all been converted into quantities. We saw this above, in Coase ’ s
vision of environmental protection, where the judge balances the right to
breathe pure air against a ‘ right to pollute ’ . The same logic can be applied
regarding the value of the pledged word and of human dignity.
A cost – benefi t analysis can be used to measure the value of keeping one ’ s
word. The theory of the effi cient breach of contract does just that: on the
basis of a calculation of utility, one of the parties can be authorised not to
honour his or her word when it is more advantageous to pay damages to the
other party than to perform the agreement. The effi cient non-performance
of a contract was fi rst theorised by Richard Posner, 50 who attributes its origin,
most probably wrongly, to Judge OW Holmes, in whose words

the only universal consequence of a legally binding promise is, that the law makes
the promisor pay damages if the promised event does not come to pass. In every
case, it leaves him free from interference until the time for fulfi llment has gone by,
and therefore free to break his contract if he chooses. 51

The promisor ’ s behaviour is to be judged not in terms of his obligation
to honour his promise, but in terms of a calculation of the greatest social
utility. When the dogmatic, and therefore priceless, value of a promise
is replaced by a monetary value, and the rule of Pacta sunt servanda

( ‘ contracts must be honoured ’ ) by the maximisation of utility, then heteronomy
has been fi nally expunged from the contractual order and reduced
to something quantifi able. The effi cient breach theory was enthusiastically
received, and is now widely applied in the US, as well as having some supporters
among French legal scholars. 52
As for the equal dignity of human beings, it represents the incalculable
par excellence. Kant famously defi nes dignity as follows: ‘ In the realm of
ends everything has either a price or dignity. Anything with a price can be
replaced by something else as its equivalent, whereas anything that is above
all price and therefore admits of no equivalent has dignity ’ .
53 Since dignity
is ‘ above all price ’ , it by defi nition cannot be subjected to calculation.
Dignity has a further drawback: as a categorical imperative, it is a duty, and
not only an individual right. Dignity thus places heteronomy at the heart of
subjectivity. It is the equivalent in law of the fact, noted by Castoriadis, that
‘ the institution of the social individual means the imposition on the psyche
of an organisation which remains essentially heterogeneous to it ’ .
54 Such
heteronomy remains incompatible with the ‘ perfect sovereignty of self over
self ’by which postmodernity characterises the subject. 55
This dual drawback may be overcome in two ways: either abolish the
principle of dignity, or convert it into something quantifi able so that it
can be fi tted into a cost – benefi t analysis. Unsurprisingly, the fi rst path was
chosen by postmodern legal scholars, the second by upholders of the Law
and Economics doctrine. The postmodern camp vilifi ed the principle of dignity
for its ‘ anti-modern ’refusal of ‘ the subjectivism inherent in human rights ’
modernity ’ .
56 To this argument, based on a value judgment, they added
the — somewhat contradictory — one that with dignity ’ s axiomatic value one
‘ left the arena of science ’ 57 and thus forfeited any de jure discussion of legal
axiomatics, law ’ s anthropological function or the value choices underlying
legislation and case law. Yet in the founding texts drafted in the wake
of the Second World War ’ s atrocities, dignity is and remains a fi rst and

inviolable principle. 58 Why, then, should legal analysis not refer to it, and be
charged with lacking scientifi city if it does so ?Does the science of law not
extend to the principles which positive law declares to be the ‘ the basis of
every human community, of peace and of justice in the world ’ ? 59 Unless the
new fundamental axiom organising legal thinking were this very prohibition
of the concept of dignity, branded as ‘ anti-modern ’and ‘ liberticidal ’ ?This
prohibition would become the emancipatory axiom of a legal order without
axioms, reduced to a juxtaposition of sovereign monads. But this move
comes at the cost of brushing aside the texts which precisely constitute the
‘ science of law ’ , and hence of abandoning what in legal thought precisely
corresponds to the ‘ arena of science ’ .
The second solution, which is just as dogmatic but less convoluted,
involves submitting dignity to a cost – benefi t analysis. This was the method
used by the Law and Economics school to settle the issue of the use of torture
in the context of the ‘ War on Terror ’ . The prohibition of torture is a primary
corollary of the principle of dignity and as such is enshrined both in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (Article 5) and in the EU Fundamental
Charter (Article 5). From the perspective of the economic analysis of law,
however, it should be weighed up against other values. Richard Posner was
the fi rst of a long list of American legal scholars to claim that ‘ If the stakes
are high enough, torture is permissible ’ .
60 Here, the resultant social utility is
calculated by balancing the dignity of the supposed terrorist — which would
be an argument for not torturing him — against the anticipated harm done
to his countless potential victims. The Hand Formula can be applied here: if
the cost B of violating the prisoner ’ s dignity is set at 100, the probability of
a terrorist attack at 0.1 and the expected damage at one million then it is an
open-and-shut case: the prisoner should be tortured in the name of overall
social utility. As with the hero of Sartre ’ s Huis Clos ( No Exit), the only question
is ‘ Where are the stakes, the racks, the leather funnels ? ’ .
This method, in which dignity, reduced to a quantifi able value, must be
balanced against other interests, has been adopted by the Court of Justice of
the European Union. Unlike our postmodern experts, the Court ’ s judges are
not entitled to assert their sovereign right to exclude the principle of dignity
from the arena of law; they have no choice but to admit its pre-eminent
value in positive law. However, this value is balanced as Richard Posner

advocated: everything depends on the sums involved; in other words, everything
is processed according to the principle of proportionality. This clearly
illustrates Horkheimer and Adorno ’ s diagnosis that ‘ eqivalence becomes the
new fetish ’ .
61 For example, in the Viking case, the European Court of Justice
ruled that human dignity has to be ‘ reconciled ’with freedom of competition,
the free circulation of goods and capital, and the freedom to provide
services, in the name of the principle of proportionality:

the exercise of the fundamental rights at issue, that is, freedom of expression and
freedom of assembly and respect for human dignity, respectively, does not fall
outside the scope of the provisions of the Treaty. Such exercise must be reconciled
with the requirements relating to rights protected under the Treaty and in accordance
with the principle of proportionality. 62

Evoking the principle of proportionality makes it possible to reduce every
sort of rule to its calculated utility, and hence to expel from legal reasoning
any idea of an inviolable law. In Germany ’ s Basic Law, however, human
dignity is precisely qualifi ed as inviolable. 63 So it should come as no surprise
that one of the rare courts to resist this trend of relativisation is the
German Constitutional Court, which declared that ‘ The right to free and
equal participation in public authority is enshrined in human dignity …The
principle of democracy may not be balanced against other legal interests; it
is inviolable. ’ 64
This brief foray into the legal debates surrounding the concept of dignity
aimed to show that when faced with something which is ‘ beyond price ’ , the
Law and Economics doctrine obliterates it by setting a price on it nonetheless.
In the total market, nothing which is price-less can have existence.

IV. NEW COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND THE MARKET IN LAW

Political economy, in its emphasis on understanding economic phenomena
which really exist, and studying them scientifi cally, has always been particularly
attentive to the diversity of legal and institutional systems. This
is also central in the economic theory of regulation and the economics of
conventions, 65 which treat diversity as a constitutive feature of economic

This extension was criticised by certain employers ’associations (for example, the BDA in Germany
and the International Organisation of Employers at the ILO), who complained that a)
despite declarations to the contrary, these standards would encroach upon the ILO ’ s areas of

life, in which different systems cannot be evaluated and hierarchised by reference
to any ideal order.
The Law and Economics doctrine, by contrast, presupposes that the
spontaneously generated market order can be helped to function well, or
hindered from doing so, by a particular legal system. The doctrine is by
defi nition prescriptive and normative, because it is forever seeking the rules
which may optimise mutual adjustments of calculated individual utilities.
One of the tasks of the economic analysis of law would thus be to assess
the performances of national legal systems against this normative optimum.
Once this assessment has been made public in all transparency, it will trigger
a mechanism whereby the best legal systems in terms of economic effi -
ciency will prevail by natural selection. Instead of free competition within
the framework of the law, the law itself shall be generated as a by-product
of free competition. Applying Darwinism to the normative sphere had
already been theorised by Hayek, who trained in law. Unconvinced by the
concept of the ‘ rational actor ’in economic theory, he had turned to the natural
selection of normative systems through competition between laws and
cultures on an international scale. In his view, Social Darwinism was wrong
to focus on the selection of congenitally fi tter individuals, because the timescales
involved were too long. It should, rather, have attended to ‘ the selective
evolution of rules and practices ’ .
66 This type of Darwinism today goes
by the name of benchmarking in management (both private and public).
The ‘ selection of best practices’consists of using the practice which has
obtained the best results as a standard, or benchmark, against which other
practices are measured. Since the best practice is itself perfectible, benchmarking
creates an upward spiral of emulation. This thinking informed the
International Organisation for Standardisation in its production of the ISO
9000 norms (which are currently being updated in order to ‘ respond to the
latest trends ’ ). They benchmark the good practices required by quality management
systems to obtain certifi cation. In the management audits of large
companies, ISO 9000 standards play a central role, and many people are
employed to ensure that the company conforms to them. Currently they are
being extended to include human resources management, in the framework
of the draft standard ISO 26000 on corporate ‘ social responsibility ’ .
67

responsibility; b) that such standards would curb the freedom of business managers; and c) that
they would be detrimental to the diversity of national legal cultures, as expressed in each body
of labour legislation. cf M Maupain , L ’ OIT àl ’ é preuve de la mondialisation fi nanci è re. Peut-on
r é guler sans contraindre ? ( Geneva , BIT , 2012 ) ).

Labor ’( 2004 ) Quarterly Journal of Economics, November, 1339 – 382 . 70 ibid, 1346.

The new type of normativity which is thus emerging in the world of work
is characterised by a) universality: these standards are applicable in every
country and every industry; b) voluntary participation: businesses may
choose to comply or not; c) the privatisation of standards, in two senses:
the ISO standards absorb elements from the public domain into the private
sector (ISO 26000 includes certain ILO standards as ‘ best practice ’ ), and the
standards are marketed (they are bought and sold).
In order to enlist national legal systems into this virtuous striving for
ever-better practice, it seemed expedient to put together some methodological
principles. This was the role of New Comparative Analysis. A group
of researchers from Yale, Harvard and the World Bank began developing
instruments for measuring investment risk, by coding and benchmarking
the rules of company law and of fi nancial market regulation. 68 They then
extended this method to labour law in an article entitled ‘ The Regulation of
Labor ’ , published in 2004. 69 This article described how the economic effi -
ciency of social and employment legislation in 82 countries was measured:

We constructed a new data set that captures different aspects of the regulation of
labor markets in 85 countries. Our measures of labor regulation deal with three
broad areas: (i) employment laws, (ii) collective relations laws, and (iii) social
security laws. [ … ]

For each of the three areas of law, we examine a range of formal legal statutes governing
labor markets. We then construct subindices summarizing different dimensions
of such protection, and fi nally aggregate these subindices into indices. We
construct all measures so that higher values correspond to more extensive legal
protection of workers. 70

For employment legislation, these subindices concerned the cost of using
atypical employment contracts, the cost of overtime, and the cost of severance
pay and dismissal procedures. Systems of equivalence were devised
to enable the different provisions in a law to be quantifi ed, from zero (the
lowest level of social protection) to 1 (the highest level of social protection).
For example, where a temporary contract can be signed only if there is a
corresponding temporary task to be performed, the score is 1, whereas if
this condition is absent, the score is 0. Where there is no provision for severance
pay, the legislation gets a higher ranking, etc. The aggregate data is

Figure 7.2: New Comparative Analysis: quantifying labour law and social
legislation

The World Bank developed its Doing Business programme with explicit
reference to this research. The programme evaluates national legal systems
in terms of their economic and fi nancial effi ciency. 72 Its regularly updated
database of fi gures gives ‘ objective measurements ’of the legal systems of
183 countries (renamed ‘ economies ’ ). It comes with an illustration: a globe
representing the earth as a space of competing legislations, and with a timetrend
cursor showing the proud onward march of economic rationality. The
database is meant to help investors choose the most hospitable countries for
their purposes. It is also designed to enlist countries to reform their legislation
in order to make it more ‘ business-friendly ’ . The resultant ‘ market in
legislative products ’is designed to eliminate in the long term the systems of
rules least able to satisfy the fi nancial expectations of investors. Competition
for the favour of the fi nancial markets should thus not be confi ned to businesses
and the economic fi eld alone, but should include whole states and
thus become a general principle organising the sphere of law. This is how

we could leave behind the dark ages of the relativity of laws and gradually
arrive at the universal laws based on calculation which Condorcet was
already dreaming of. 73
In theory, this quantifi cation is axiologically neutral and does not favour
any particular type of law. Yet all these studies come to the same conclusion:
the culture of common law is better than all others. We should not necessarily
see in this some unacknowledged chauvinism. It is, rather, the logical
consequence of the close links between the Law and Economics doctrine
and the culture of common law. Common law conceives the law not as the
expression of a sovereign will, but as a spontaneously created order, requiring
for its ongoing development only a judge and the free play of individual
rights. 74 In many respects, the Law and Economics doctrine is a fundamentalist
variant of this legal culture. Besides, ‘ fundamentalism ’is originally a
Protestant notion, a late-nineteenth-century doctrine developed in traditionalist
American circles, advocating a literal interpretation of the Scriptures
in opposition to theological liberalism and the Social Gospel movement.
But confi ning thought within the letter of a text also characterises what
we today call Islamic fundamentalism. It too seeks to subject national legal
systems to a literal interpretation of Sharia and to attack the diversity of
traditions, customs and schools which have always also informed Muslim
legal doctrine. What these many different fundamentalisms have in common
is their reference to a universal norm which human laws are meant to relay
and implement, but never antagonise. This is why fundamentalist doctrines
are so implacable and ruthless.
The World Bank ’ s 2005 ‘ Doing Business ’report contained a chapter on
labour law entitled ‘ Hiring and Firing Workers ’ , explicitly using the research
done by the Botera / La Porta team at Yale and Harvard. The chapter measures,
country by country, how labour legislation deters investment — since
the whole process of quantifi cation is ultimately designed to demonstrate
that social protection for employees is economically ineffi cient. 75 Labour
legislation not only causes costly ‘ rigidities ’ — so the argument goes — which
in turn generate high unemployment rates, a larger ‘ informal sector ’and
a relative decrease in the proportion of income reaching the poorest, but
more generally it compromises the maximisation of social utility, which
labour market deregulation precisely optimises. We are familiar with this
kind of argument and its unmistakable political message, tirelessly relayed
by the OECD, the IMF and the European Commission. Yet one might have
thought that after the collapse of the fi nancial markets in 2008, the most
urgent task would be to regulate them. But no: the principal lesson drawn by

international economic organisations from this fi nancial disaster was that
countries should urgently deregulate their labour markets and dismantle
their institutions of solidarity. According to Mario Draghi, the President of
the European Central Bank (ECB) and former International Vice-President
of Goldman Sachs in charge of European Affairs, 76 Europe ’ s social model is
of the past, and the duty of member states is now to introduce fl exibility into
labour markets wherever this has not already been done. 77
But already before the bankruptcies of 2008 the European Court of
Justice had supported the idea of making national legal systems compete
against each other, when it ruled, in the 1999 Centros case, that a business
could dodge the rules of the country in which it was operating by registering
in a country with less restrictive legislation. 78 It thus legalised the practice of
fl ags of convenience, but on dry land, allowing businesses to play member
states off against each other in favour of the legislation which could provide
the highest business profi ts. Extending this decision to labour law in the
famous Laval and Viking cases, the Court ruled that businesses with headquarters
in countries with scanty employee protection should be allowed to
fully exploit this comparative advantage when operating in countries still
resisting the injunction to deregulate their labour markets. 79 In no time at
all, the quantitative criteria advocated by the Law and Economics doctrine
have become a cornerstone of European case law. 80
We should not be surprised that case law has embraced the Law and
Economics doctrine in this way. Ever since its origins in Rome, the law has
been instrumentalised by all sorts of ideologies, limited only by the legal
order ’ s autonomy. 81 When this autonomy is not respected, and the ‘ fetishism
New Comparative Analysis and the Market in Law 143

of the legal form ’is broken, one can no longer talk of legal norms, whatever
the pretence. For those in power, the law has always been both a tool and
an obstacle; its use as a tool will always be challenged by its dimension
of resistance. Tocqueville understood this well, describing the ‘ spirit of the
jurist ’as the only counterweight to the tyranny of the majority in a democratic
regime. 82 This dual feature of law leads us to examine the incursions
of governance by numbers into the law, in order to identify this doctrine ’ s
inevitable failures and the legal form ’ s resistance.

The Encroachment of Governance
on Law

‘ The battle of performance will only really be won after several years,
because it fi rst has to be won in people ’ s minds. ’ 1

THE IMAGINARY REPRESENTATION of society as a set of
‘ elementary particles ’driven only by individual interest has a systematic
force whose effects permeate every area of human life. For
instance, the way the principle of equality has been interpreted to support
the rejection of sexual difference stems from exactly the same type of selfreferential
calculation as that championed by neoliberal economics. 2 We
should therefore look further than the strictly political or corporate realm
to gauge the full extent of how governance by numbers has penetrated the
sphere of law, and also consider issues of personal status and private life.
Eros and Anank é — the need for the other sex and the need to work — are
the basis of every human civilisation, in that they oblige each individual to
enter into relation with the others under a common law, or a set of shared
representations characteristic of a given culture. Insofar as governance by
numbers seeks to programme human behaviour, it cannot fail to leave its
mark on issues of personal status and identity. Instead of making the human
being mechanically obey rules, as was the case historically with the ‘ Administrative
State ’[ l ’ É tat administratif] and the Fordist factory, governance by
numbers thrives on the human being ’ s capacity — as highlighted by Norbert
Wiener — to give any information received ‘ a new form in order that it may
be used with a view to later stages in the functioning ’of the system. 3
Industrial-era capitalism and communism both sought to impose a supposedly
scientifi c form of organisation of work on the whole of society.
Far from disappearing, this desire has simply updated its model: from
a machine of weights and forces obeying the laws of classical physics,

always ‘ management ’ . It so happens that ‘ management ’was initially a French term taken up
into English, which returned to France with its modern sense: Bossuet mentions Francis of
Assisi ’ s inability to become a good m é nager of his father ’ s business affairs ( cf Pan é gyrique de
saint Fran ç ois d ’ Assise, in Œ uvres (Paris, Gallimard, coll ‘ Biblioth è que de la Pl é iade ’ , 1961).

where the worker was simply a cog which obeyed orders, the vision of
the organisation of work has shifted to a system of self-adjusting interacting
units automatically responding to signal inputs and feedback, as
programmed by computer algorithms. What we see occurring in the legal
sphere, where governance by numbers tends to supplant government by
laws, has its counterpart in the triumphs of the ICT revolution at all levels
of the organisation of work. The individual, the company and the nation
are uniformly expected to fulfi l objectives, and their success in this is rated
by numerical indicators.
Governance by numbers thus has an immediate impact on the division
of labour, which it understands in the most restrictive and illusory sense
of salaried employment, and which it is anyway unable to address because
it is by nature blind to the difference between human labour and machine
work. In the comprehensive, Durkheimian sense, the division of labour
affects every level of human cooperation, whether between individuals, in
the company, in the public sphere or in international relations. At all these
levels, the purchase of governance by numbers on the law is palpable in
the way concepts and methods originally developed for managing companies,
namely ‘ management by objectives ’ , have been transposed into law. 4
This operation was facilitated by the fact that management is based on a
casuistry similar to that of law (at least before it broke up into more or
less impermeable disciplinary compartments). The bond between law and
management methods has been stressed time and again by Pierre Legendre, 5
and has also been analysed by Romain Laufer, who has shown what the
consecration of management science as a university subject owed, over the
last century, to the rational systematisation of cases, that is, to a notion of
‘ case law ’common to management and law. 6 This explains the permeability
between the two disciplines, as illustrated by the spectacular impact in law
of management by objectives, which has become, as Peter Drucker describes

in a chapter devoted to the subject in his book of 1954, ‘ a new philosophy
of management ’for businesses: 7

What the business enterprise needs is a principle of management that will give
full scope to individual strength and responsibility, as well as common direction
to vision and effort, one that will establish teamwork and harmonize the goals of
the individual with the common good. Management by objectives and self-control
makes the interest of the enterprise the aim of every manager. In place of
control from outside, it substitutes the stricter, more exacting, and more effective
control from inside. It motivates managers to action, not because somebody tells
them to do something or talks them into doing it, but because the objective task
demands it. They act not because somebody wants them to but because they themselves
decide that they have to — they act, in other words, as free men and women. 8

After repudiating Taylorism, this new philosophy of how to govern human
beings had incredible success, in the business world and beyond. It is strikingly
similar to Norbert Wiener ’ s refl ections in his Cybernetics and society. The
human use of human beings, published four years earlier. 9 For both authors,
self-control is the key to how human organisations should function. This new
key to the organisation of work was thus theorised in disciplines as far apart
as cybernetics and management, and half a century before the generalised
use of computers in the real economy. This alone demonstrates the power of
a particular period ’ s ‘ imaginary institution of society ’ , in this case management
by objectives which is today ’ s paradigm of the scientifi c organisation of
work, in the public and private sector alike. Staff are no longer subjected to
rules defi ning their tasks in advance, but rather are involved in the elaboration
of the task ’ s objectives, which should be quantifi able, and which refl ect,
at each level, the common goals of the organisation. Each worker is thus
‘ objectifi ed ’ , measuring (and reducing) the gap between the objectives set and
his or her actual performance. This is achieved through ‘ self-control ’ , which
in Drucker ’ s terms is identical with ‘ freedom ’ , since it satisfi es ‘ a desire to do
the best rather than do just enough to get by. ’ 10 Drucker ’ s prescience, in his
chapter ‘ Management by Objectives and Self-Control ’ , is striking: he warns
against misinterpretation and abuse of his method, stressing that the objectives
requiring self-monitoring ‘ must never become the grounds for “ management
by domination ”because this would destroy their very purpose ’ .

salariaux ’( 2013 ) Revue de droit du travail 82 – 89 . 15 See above, ch 7 , p 128ff.

Moreover, he was convinced that not all objectives can be quantifi ed, and
he criticised the irrational tendency to pursue one single goal: ‘ to manage a
business, ’Drucker writes, ‘ is to balance a variety of needs and goals, and this
requires judgment. The search for ‘ one right objective ’is essentially an unproductive
quest for the philosopher ’ s stone. It is irrational to seek to replace
judgment with a formula ’ .
12
Yet despite these warnings, management by objectives in practice has
taken precisely these aberrant paths: management for domination; generalised
quantifi cation; and the focus on a single objective — bibliometrics for the
researcher; value-creation for the shareholder; or reducing the public defi cit
to under three per cent of the GDP, for a country. And ‘ fi xing objectives ’has
burgeoned in all branches of law over the last twenty years. 13 To examine
this invasion of the legal sphere by governance by numbers, we shall not,
however, start from law ’ s different branches, if only because governance
by numbers precisely ignores such divisions, and subjects the whole of law,
indifferently, to the same pre-programming of human action. Additionally,
since the legal corpus affected is already too large for any exhaustive analysis,
we shall confi ne ourselves to spotlighting different levels in the division
of labour. Through this focus, we shall show how the dynamics of governance
by numbers affects the legal frameworks of the individual worker, the
company, the state, the European Union, and international relations.

I. INDIVIDUAL GOVERNANCE

It is now common practice in the workplace for objectives to be fi xed for
individuals. This is sometimes done unilaterally by the employer, by virtue
of his or her management prerogatives, but they may also be the object of
a contract, 14 serving as parameters for pay, or actually mentioned in the
contract, when someone is recruited specifi cally to achieve them. Employees
invariably enjoy a certain autonomy in the way they choose to attain
objectives. At all events, the legal force behind objectives can have the effect
of transferring a certain amount of economic risk to the worker, in line
with the theory of agency. 15 Fixing objectives always brings with it procedures
for evaluating performance, which can take two complementary
forms: a quantifi ed form, which measures performance; and a discursive
form, through individual interviews, during which the employee and his
manager analyse the employee ’ s performance, and may revise the objectives
in the light of this. There is an abundant, and most instructive, literature in
148 The Encroachment of Governance on Law

management and workplace psychology on the theory and practice of these
evaluations in companies. 16 From the legal perspective, in the terms of the
French Cour de cassation, ‘ the employer ’ s management role, as derived from
the work contract, authorises him to evaluate the work of his employees ’ .
17
In a certain number of cases (for example, skills assessment) evaluation is
even prescribed by law. In French law, certain obligations such as transparency
(advance notifi cation) and the suitability of evaluation methods and
techniques are included under the general duty to perform the work contract
in good faith, 18 thus giving legal force to the ideals of management
by objectives. 19 The counterpart of this management method in the public
sector was the — at fi rst piecemeal — introduction of performance-related
bonuses, which civil servants received if they met the objectives assigned to
them: after the judiciary, 20 the police, 21 certain levels of central government
administration, 22 and other branches, the practice of performance-related
bonuses was generalised, in 2010. 23 Governance by numbers has also spread
into the management of certain self-employed groups in France, if they are
fi nanced, at least in part, by compulsory contributions. This applies to certain
medical practitioners, 24 who are subject to enforceable principles of
good practice in, for example, prescription expenses (in accordance with the
r é f é rences m é dicales opposables, or RMO); and to another self-employed
sector, farmers, whose outputs are regulated by objectives imposed by the
EU, if the farms are in receipt of European funds.

II. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

In the corporate sector, the penetration of governance by numbers into
the legal sphere is evident in the laws passed to oblige companies trading
on the stock markets to respect the imperative of ‘ value creation ’for

their shareholders. 25 Many legislative techniques were invented to facilitate
these reforms, two of which are particularly signifi cant. The fi rst was the
highly successful phenomenon of stock options, or free shares. 26 Agency
theory advocated this mechanism as a way of ensuring that company managers
fulfi lled the objective of improving the company ’ s short-term performance
on the stock market. The second example is the leveraged buy-out, a
legal and fi nancial arrangement which obliges the company which is bought
(the ‘ target ’company) to pay the costs of its own buy-out, by ‘ squeezing it
like a lemon ’ , so that it produces a maximum number of dividends. 27 The
expansion of governance by numbers in the corporate sector also results
from having abandoned the industrial era ’ s integrated model in favour of
today ’ s networked organisation. This type of organisation, aided by digital
technologies, which make the subcontractor transparent to the contracting
customer, enables the latter to maintain technical and economic control over
a section of the production process, without having to assume any legal
responsibility for it. The generalisation of this model internationally has
created countless dependent entrepreneurs, all over the world, who work
under the more or less stringent monitoring of one or several clients, meeting
the objectives fi xed by them. Although the networked structure is generally
justifi ed by the declared wish of companies to refocus their activities on
their core business, this trend is also guided by the fi nancial markets, which
hope to draw the maximum fi nancial gains from the different ‘ profi t units ’
of the production chain, through stimulating competition. Recent scandals
in the food business and textile industry 28 have shown the large-scale effects
on health of the irresponsibility of those in positions of economic power, an
irresponsibility authorised by this mode of organisation of work.
Another, rarer, aspect of companies ’enslavement to meeting objectives is
evident not in company or in fi nancial law, but in labour law. It takes the
form of an obligation to negotiate, a process initially restricted to issues
of pay, hours of work and the organisation of working time. Later, these
obligations were extended to the implementation of public policies such
as equality between men and women in the workplace, the inclusion of a
disabled or an older workforce, and the provision of collective insurance

law gives the social partners the right to negotiate the terms of proposed legislative or regulatory
labour law reforms falling within the limits defi ned for cross-sector or national collective
bargaining. See N Maggi-Germain , ‘ Sur le dialogue social ’( 2007 ) Droit social 798 ; J-F Cesaro ,

or profi t-sharing schemes. Regarding sexual equality in the workplace in
France, heads of companies of more than 300 employees are now obliged
by law to draw up, unilaterally, ‘ an action plan designed to ensure equality
in the workplace between women and men ’ . This plan must be based
on ‘ relevant indicators, particularly quantifi able data, defi ned by ordinance,
which may be supplemented by indicators which take into account the company
’ s particular situation ’ . Having evaluated the objectives fi xed and the
measures taken in the course of the preceding year, this action plan

‘ determines the progress on objectives to be achieved in the following year, the
qualitative and quantitative description of the actions by which these may be
achieved, and an estimation of their cost. [ … ] A synthesis of this action plan,
comprising at least the progress on indicators and objectives defi ned by ordinance,
shall be made known to the employees by the employer. ’ 29

We should note in passing the confusion, which is characteristic of governance
by numbers, between the objectives assigned and the indicators
measuring performance. 30 Governance here devolves a regulatory role previously
held by the State onto private individuals. The use of ‘ negotiated
law ’ — applied overwhelmingly today in labour issues 31— is the clearest
proof of how the social partners are enlisted to defi ne the legal measures for
implementing objectives fi xed by the public authorities. As we shall see, the
heart of the matter is the erosion of the border between private and public
spheres 32 because governance obliges unions and companies to carry out
roles previously reserved for the State alone, and inversely, the State applies
to itself the principles of corporate governance.
In the corporate world, governance by numbers is most clearly expressed
in the profi t margins fi xed by share-holders. In evaluating whether a company
is suffi ciently profi table, two methods are used, both of which have
a legal dimension. One is stock market fi gures, which are meant to refl ect
the value of the company in the eyes of the fi nancial markets; and the other
is the company ’ s accounts, which are meant to give ‘ a fair representation
of the assets, the fi nancial situation and results ’of the company. 33 The
impact of governance by numbers on fi nancial legislation has been considerable
since the neoliberal turn of the 1980s, with the abolition of state

orders to be placed per millisecond. Today, 90 %of the orders placed on the stock markets in
Europe have been issued by these ‘ high-frequency traders ’ . The fi gure is even greater in the US,
where several ‘ fl ash crashes ’on Wall Street have been attributed to these operations, including
that of 6 May 2010 ( cf ‘ High-Frequency Trading ’ , New York Times, 10 October 2011). 37 Couret and Nabasque, Droit fi nancier (n 5) 16. 38 A Gaudemet , Les D é riv é s ( Paris , Economica , 2010 ) , preface H Synvet, 328. 39 cf Couret and Nabasque, Droit fi nancier (n 5) 814.

regulation and the reliance on market regulators. The result has been the
normative self-enclosure of the world ’ s fi nancial systems. 34 In the context
of this drive to self-regulation, the fi nancial markets themselves have been
transformed into ‘ market undertakings ’ , valued on their own market, such
as to become entirely self-referential fi nancial products. Moreover, the international
association of market regulators — the International Organisation
of Securities Commission (IOSCO-OICV) — itself recommends using selfregulatory
organisations (SROs), which in its view are the only bodies capable
of responding to the technical demands of the fi nancial markets. 35 But
when one knows that the majority of orders on these markets are passed by
computers programmed to carry out high-speed trading, in which profi ts
may be derived from differences in trading prices as little as a millisecond
apart, 36 one can see how extensively the cybernetic dream of having human
affairs run themselves on automatic pilot is becoming a reality. One of the
best-known consequences of this shift from heteronomy to autonomy has
been the exponential development of new fi nancial products and the correlative
boom in two highly unstable techniques: securitisation and credit
derivatives.
Securitisation brings about what the most knowledgeable authors have
called a ‘ quite extraordinary alchemy ’ , whereby ‘ debts which are nonderivative
and can only circulate with diffi culty, may be transformed into
securities, that is, into identical fungible assets circulating without diffi -
culty on a market ’ .
37 We should take this term ‘ alchemy ’in its literal sense:
the transformation of lead into gold. The problem is then to prevent gold
becoming lead again, and this is why credit derivatives were invented. 38
These derivatives are futures, meaning that a risk inherent in a debt or a
group of debts may be transferred, by virtue of a contract with consideration,
without having to transfer the debt itself. The best known of these
derivatives are credit default swaps (CDS), which were phenomenally successful,
reaching a monetary volume of 30,000 billion dollars in 2006. 39
152 The Encroachment of Governance on Law

40 Named after John Law who, with the support of the Regent, converted the public debt
into paper money backed against future income from the colonies. This fi rst speculative bubble
founded on banknotes burst in 1720 (see E Faure , La Banqueroute de Law ( Paris , Gallimard ,
1977 ) ). 41 See above, ch 5 , p 99. 42 F Morin , Le Nouveau Mur de l ’ argent. Essai sur la fi nance globalis é e ( Paris , Le Seuil ,
2006 ) 277 . 43 Andr é Orl é an , L ’ Empire de la valeur. Refonder l ’ é conomie, Paris , Le Seuil , 2011 , p 307 . 44 See above, ch 5 , pp 94–96. 45 Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
19 July 2002. The American counterpart, or rather twin, of the IASC is the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB), and between them they carve up accounting standardisation for
the whole world.

Although their function was to insure against fi nancial risks, they and other
similar instruments increased these risks considerably, and themselves became
the object of large-scale speculation. So there is nothing new since Law’s
fi nancial system 40— except that we seem to have lost sight of the reasons
why, in the eighteenth century, insurance mechanisms too close to games
of chance were prohibited. 41 But it is hardly surprising that economic policies
based on game theory should generate a casino economy. Such fi nancial
instruments have created a monstrous speculative bubble, estimated today
at 90 per cent of all fi nancial transactions. Some economists, among them
Fran ç ois Morin, warned early on against the risk of this ‘ wall of money ’ ,
42
detached from any real economic basis. Like a tsunami, it is capable of
sweeping away real human lives. And as another economist, Andr éOrl é an,
has shown, the fi nancial markets do not obey the law of supply and demand.
This is because every operator is by turns a buyer and a seller, and because
the operator does not speculate on the value of goods, but on the value that
others will assign to them in the future. As a result, ‘ price, on the fi nancial
markets, does not express a magnitude defi ned prior to the market interaction,
but is a pure creation of the fi nancial community as it goes looking for
liquidity ’ .
43
Alongside stock market fi gures, the second tool used to measure the
value of companies is their fi nancial accounts. Accounting standards were
reformed at roughly the same time as these fi nancial instruments were
developed, and there too the impact of governance by numbers and the
ideal of self-referential calculations are palpable. Accounting logic has been
inverted. Ever since the invention in medieval times of double-entry bookkeeping,
the principle of prudence 44 had prevailed to ensure that one could
record as assets only the historical cost of goods owned, that is, their purchase
value minus depreciation. When in 2002 the European Union farmed
out the development of new accounting standards to a private body, the
International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), 45 it simultaneously
did away with the principle of prudence, replacing it with the concept of
‘ fair value ’ , which is the estimated value of the good if sold on the market

on the date the accounts are drawn up. As Samuel Jub éhas shown, these
reforms have utterly transformed the role of accounting and the meaning
of accountability. 46 Accounts are no longer the quantifi ed reminder of an
entrepreneur ’ s legal responsibilities towards third parties, but are now an
instrument for measuring a company ’ s market value in comparison with
its competitors. The stock market value of companies is largely based on
this sort of benchmarking, and since company directors are obliged to
espouse the immediate interests of their share-holders, improving a company
’ s accounting image has become an end in itself, independently of its
real performance and long-term interests. This has produced the phenomenon
of redundancies based on stock-market performance, which improve
the company ’ s present value, but harm its future, represented by its human
potential. This mode of valuation can be termed procyclical, because it
infl ates stock market values in boom times, and wipes them out when the
markets plunge. After the stock market crash of 2008, the European banks
argued successfully for calculating their loans not at their (immediate) ‘ fair
value ’ , but at their historical cost 47— thus returning to the principle of prudence
when it was to their advantage. One could summarise this by saying
that when a mafi a-style system holds sway, the fi gure of the guarantor does
not disappear, but it abandons overseeing equitable exchange in favour of
protecting the ongoing opportunities for predation.

III. PUBLIC SECTOR GOVERNANCE

In the public sector, governance by numbers was introduced in the name
of the burgeoning science of organisations through a programme called
New Public Management, which applied the rules and methods developed
for private sector management to the public sphere. 48 In France, social
security law was the fi rst area to be affected by this new methodology, when
a national objective of health insurance expenditure (ONDAM) was introduced
in 1996, to be fi xed annually by a law on funding the social security. 49

However, despite the efforts of Parliament, this innovation did not have
a very signifi cant normative impact, 50 unlike the Constitutional Bylaw, or
Organic Law, on Budget Acts (the LOLF, or Loi organique relative aux
lois de fi nances), which was passed by all parties in 2001. 51 The main issue
behind this reform was the ‘ performance ’of public policy. As Didier Migaud
and Gilles Carrez, two members of the Finance Committee, stated in their
Report to Parliament, ‘ the battle of performance will only really be won
after several years, because it fi rst has to be won in people ’ s minds ’ .
52 This
military vocabulary — the ‘ battle ’ , and psychological warfare — is characteristic
of the rhetoric of total mobilisation in all its forms. In this case, mobilising
people ’ s minds involves a revolution in the language of governmental
action, in order to make it meet quantifi ed objectives, as illustrated by the
following extract from the LOLF:

— the budget acts are ‘ in keeping with a defi ned economic equilibrium as
well as the objectives and performances of the programmes that they
determine ’ ;
— a mission ‘ covers a set of programmes designed to contribute to a
defi ned public policy ’ ;
— a programme ‘ covers appropriations for implementing an action or a
consistent set of actions coming under the same ministry and involving
both specifi c objectives, defi ned in the public interest, and expected
results subject to evaluation. ’
— An action is ‘ a component of a programme. [ … ] If an action has an
identifi able fi nality, it may be tied to objectives and indicators which
are specifi c to it, among those associated with the programme ’ ;
— a programme ’ s operational budget (BOP): ‘ the totality of the means
associated with the objectives measured by results indicators. The
objectives of the programme ’ s operational budget are defi ned in the
detailed objectives of the programme ’ ;

— indicators: ‘ a quantifi ed indicator gives a numerical indication of the performance
progress expected and obtained. Each indicator sets a quantifi
ed projection for the year of the budget act and for the medium term ’ ;
— the annual performance plans (PAP) for each programme contain ‘ the
presentation of its actions, associated costs, objectives, and results
obtained and expected for the coming years measured by a justifi ed
choice of accurate indicators ’ ;
— The annual performance reports (RAP) show, by programme, ‘ the
objectives and results, expected and obtained, the indicators and associated
costs ’ , highlighting ‘ the deviations from the budget act projections
for the year considered as well as from the actual sums reported
in the latest budget review act ’ .
53

The number of objectives contained in the PAPs and the RAPs can be estimated
at around 500, each of which comes with its indicators, to give a
‘ numerical indication of the performance progress expected and obtained ’ .
54
To these should be added the avalanche of objectives set internally, from the
highest to the lowest level, in each public institution. The introduction of
this new type of governance went hand in hand with applying in the public
sector the accounting standards used in the corporate sector. 55 Since that
date, ‘ the rules applicable to government accrual-based accounting only
differ from those applicable to companies on the grounds of the specifi c
nature of government action ’ .
56 This has given rise to a lucrative market in
the certifi cation of public accounts by private audit fi rms. 57 Applying these
accounting standards means that public institutions are henceforth valued
at their estimated market sale price.
To complement these reforms, the programming of public funding and
the subordination of governmental action to the accounting imperative of
balanced books was constitutionalised in France in 2008. The equivalent
of the private sector ’ s ‘ bottom line ’ , that is, the fi gure which can be treated as
the ‘ objective indicator ’of public action, has become, for the public sector,
the budget defi cit or surplus. In the terms of article 34 of the French Constitution,
‘ The multi-annual guidelines for public fi nances shall be established
by Programming Acts. They shall contribute to achieving the objective of
balanced accounts for public administrations. ’ 58 In order to avoid laxism,

which always threatens democratic regimes, some countries have constitutionalised
a ‘ budgetary golden rule ’ , which results in automatic budget cuts
(in American law, ‘ sequestrations ’ ) if the authorised defi cit is exceeded. 59
The relations between central and regional and local government, or
equally public agencies, are likewise specifi ed by numerical objectives. 60
‘ Contracts of agreed objectives ’have mushroomed beyond any possible
overview, but to give a taste of their range of application, there are: government-region
strategic plan contracts; contracts of objectives and means for
continuing professional development; 61 territorial climate energy plans; 62
multi-annual contracts of objectives and means in healthcare; 63 contracts
of objectives for administrative courts; 64 multi-annual contracts between
the state and university establishments, 65 etc. All of these contracts are of
course accompanied by performance and procedures indicators, in order to
monitor their execution.
France is by no means unique in this development, which seems to have
become the norm for public policy implementation throughout the world.
The educational reform brought about in the US by the law ‘ No Child Left
Behind ’(2002) is a good example. Like the LOLF in France, this law was
passed with support from both the majority and the opposition. It fi xed
‘ knowledge stages for different levels of public schooling ’ , and ‘ a general
system for monitoring pupils ’results ’ , thanks to yearly performance tests.
Both the school and the district are considered responsible for their pupils ’
results. When schools do not meet the objectives fi xed, they are declared as
‘ fail[ing] to make Adequate Yearly Progress ’(AYP). Corrective measures are
then taken, sometimes accompanied by a two-year ‘ turnaround plan ’ . The
school can thereafter be called a ‘ School in Need of Improvement (SINI),
if the objectives set are not met within these two years, or a School Under
Registration Review’(SURR). If the ‘ failure ’continues, the district informs

managed as a ‘ charter school ’(under contract with the state), in which case
it has reduced administrative obligations, but it absolutely must meet its
objectives if it wants to see its contract renewed. The school can also have
its teaching or administrative staff replaced. The public authorities can also
request that ‘ an entity such as a private management company which has
proved its effi cacy ’manage the school. On the other hand, when the school
meets or catches up on its objectives, it can receive bonuses ( State Academic
Achievement Awards). 66

IV. EUROPEAN GOVERNANCE

At the European level, Member States ’obligations to attain certain quantifi
ed objectives were fi rst enshrined in the Treaty of Maastricht (1992),
with the decision to create a single European currency. Four convergence
criteria, or objectives common to all Member States, were adopted at the
time, namely the control of infl ation, the control of the budget defi cit and
the public debt, a stable exchange rate mechanism and the convergence of
interest rates. From the start, this subordination of economic policies to
objectives was assessed by ‘ objective indicators ’ , which were both the goal
and the measure of countries ’performances. For example, the indicator of
price stability is that a country ’ s rate of infl ation does not exceed by more
than 1.5 points the rate of infl ation in the three Member States with the best
results. The indicator for the control of public spending is that the defi cit
of general government and social security does not exceed three per cent of
the GDP, and the level of the public debt, not more than 60 per cent of the
GDP. As for long-term interest rates, they must not be more than two per
cent higher than the rates of the three Member States with the best results
in terms of price stability (a technique called ‘ benchmarking ’ , where performance
is measured not by an absolute standard but by reference to the
performance of others). 67
Since this mechanism never worked, rather than examine its workability,
the screws were simply tightened over 20 long years. Thus, in 1997,
the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) signed in Amsterdam obliged Member
States to submit a yearly ‘ stability programme ’for the ensuing three years to
the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN). This council adopts
a host of objectives every year — the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines

La Tribune, 1 October 2010 . 69 One of the promises on which the French President was elected in 2012 was that he
would not ratify this text as it stood; no sooner elected, than he did just that. The Constitutional
Council handed down a particularly tortuous decision to the effect that this ratifi cation
did not require prior revision of the Constitution ( Conseil constitutionnel, No 2012-653 DC,
9 August 2012).

(BEPG) — which are implemented by Member States under mutual monitoring.
The Pact has introduced fi nancial penalties for Member States with a
defi cit in excess of the objective indicator of three per cent of their GDP.
Why this fi gure ?One of the brains behind it, who was a member of the
Budget Directorate at the time, described the process in terms which reveal
our leaders ’fetishistic worship of numbers, and the attendant loss of contact
with the realities of the economy:

Focusing on the defi cit of a particular year doesn ’ t have much sense and relating
it to the GDP of the same year has even less. The defi cit to GDP ratio [ … ] can in
any case never be used to indicate a trend; it does not measure anything: it is not
a criterion. The only valid tool is an analysis of the country ’ s capacity to repay
its debts, that is, an analysis of their fi nancial health [ … ]. Be that as it may, the
political — not economic, but political — question does not go away: how transmute
the lead of a reasoned analysis of creditworthiness into the visible gold of an
arresting and punchy rallying cry ? 68

The last step in the enslavement of Member States to the imperative of
attaining numerical objectives was taken on 1 January 2013, when the
Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and
Monetary Union (the Fiscal Stability Treaty) came into force. Article III of
this Treaty is a perfect example of governance by numbers: it fi xes an objective,
immediately translated into numerical indicators, of a balanced budget
or a budgetary surplus, lays down a timeline for achieving this objective,
and the evaluation procedures to be employed. Going against an electoral
promise, 69 this text was ratifi ed by France. Its most important sections contain
the following:

Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary
Union, Article III:

1. The Contracting Parties shall apply the rules set out in this paragraph in addition
and without prejudice to their obligations under European Union law:

(a) the budgetary position of the general government of a Contracting Party
shall be balanced or in surplus;
(b) the rule under point (a) shall be deemed to be respected if the annual structural
balance of the general government is at its country-specifi c mediumterm
objective, as defi ned in the revised Stability and Growth Pact, with
a lower limit of a structural defi cit of 0.5 %of the gross domestic product

at market prices. The Contracting Parties shall ensure rapid convergence
towards their respective medium-term objective. The time-frame for such
convergence will be proposed by the European Commission taking into consideration
country-specifi c sustainability risks. Progress towards, and respect
of, the medium-term objective shall be evaluated on the basis of an overall
assessment with the structural balance as a reference, including an analysis
of expenditure net of discretionary revenue measures, in line with the revised
Stability and Growth Pact;
(c) the Contracting Parties may temporarily deviate from their respective
medium-term objective or the adjustment path towards it only in exceptional
circumstances, as defi ned in point (b) of paragraph 3;
(d) where the ratio of the general government debt to gross domestic product at
market prices is signifi cantly below 60 %and where risks in terms of longterm
sustainability of public fi nances are low, the lower limit of the mediumterm
objective specifi ed under point (b) can reach a structural defi cit of at
most 1.0 %of the gross domestic product at market prices.

Where this Treaty is really new, catapulting us into the era of legal cybernetics,
is in its introduction of a corrective mechanism which ‘ is triggered automatically
in the event of signifi cant observed deviations from the medium-term
objective or the adjustment path towards it. The mechanism shall include
the obligation of the Contracting Party concerned to implement measures
to correct the deviations over a defi ned period of time ’(Art 3e). In France,
this mechanism has taken the form of the Haut Conseil des fi nances publiques
(Higher Council on Public Finances), an independent body headed
by Didier Migaud, one of the fathers of the LOLF, and Chair of the Cour
des comptes (France ’ s highest institution for auditing public fi nances). If a
signifi cant gap is observed between the path for re-establishing a balanced
budget and the objective assigned, the government must respond to this in
its public expenditure or social security proposals during that year. 70
But how solid is this legal armature through which economic policy
choices are funnelled ?Not one of the quantifi ed objectives fi xed by
European law since the Maastricht Treaty has ever really been fulfi lled, and
the ‘ golden rule ’imposed on all the Eurozone countries by the Stability and
Growth Pact probably has the same fate awaiting it. 71 Iron discipline was
imposed not there but elsewhere, in the Maastricht Treaty ’ s obligation on
the European Central Bank to follow one single objective only, that of price
stability, 72 and in its prohibition on lending to Member States. 73 These are

government bonds, and whose primary role is to ensure full employment.
Since Eurozone countries cannot get fi nancing from the Central Bank, they
are at the mercy of the whims of the fi nancial markets. The numbers really
endowed with normative force are not the ones mentioned in the Treaties,
but rather the interest rates on the bond markets. 74

V. GLOBAL GOVERNANCE

Governance by numbers on an international level has two facets: public and
private. Its public aspect is clearest in the conditions imposed by international
institutions on the assistance they give to countries in fi nancial diffi culty. Aid
is provided either within the framework of global plans — structural adjustment
plans — or within narrower programmes. All aid programmes come
complete with their quantifi ed indicators, by which the country ’ s success in
attaining the assigned objectives is measured. These numerical indicators
have given the IMF a lot of power, ever since the dollar left the gold standard
in 1971, under Richard Nixon, with the resulting fl oating of currencies.
Currencies were then themselves treated as though they were products, with
the price being determined by the fi nancial markets, such that the IMF ’ s mission
as guardian of the international monetary order became meaningless.
Since then, the IMF ’ s main aim has been to force countries to obey the three
commandments of neoliberalism: abolishing trade barriers; deregulating the
labour markets; and privatising public services. The fi nancial assistance proposed
by the IMF is at that cost. 75 The payment of the fi nancial aid is staggered,
and is conditional upon attaining the agreed objectives, as evaluated
by quantitative criteria, 76 which invariably include macro-economic variables
such as certain monetary and credit aggregates, international reserves,
budgetary balances and foreign borrowing. Failure to meet one of the quantitative
targets may be tolerated by the IMF when the deviation in question is
insignifi cant or temporary, or if national authorities have taken, or will take,
corrective measures — this principle has also been adopted for monetary discipline
in the Eurozone. Structural adjustment plans, which were fi rst tested in
Latin America, particularly Argentina (leading to its bankruptcy), were later
applied to many Southern countries, particularly in Africa, and were later
prescribed to Eurozone countries under the aegis of the Troika (the European
Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF).

The mechanism of ‘ conditionality ’ , with its numerical indicators, is not
the preserve of the IMF. The EU and the World Bank also apply such conditions
in their aid programmes to poor countries. The social and economic
disasters they have generated led to the introduction of another type of programme,
using other quantifi ed objectives: the fi ght against poverty; good
governance; and human development. 77 These have been the objectives
of the UN ’ s Development Programme (the UNDP) since 1990, and, since
2000, of the ‘ UN Millennium Development Goals ’ .
78 It was from within the
UNDP that Amartya Sen and Mahbub ul Haq came up with their ‘ human
development index ’ . After several changes, it stabilised in 2011 into the
following formula:

IDH I I I Life Education I I × ncome ILif

where ILife, IEducation and IIncome are the indicators for longevity, level of education
and standard of living respectively.
This index is constructed by aggregating sub-indices designed to measure
health, lifespan, level of education and standard of living. For example, the
level of education is measured by the average length of formal education
for 25-year-old adults, and the expected length of education for school-age
children. Similar indices were developed to measure ‘ good governance ’ .
79
These indicators of ‘ well-being ’have been all the rage recently, 80 particularly
in anti-poverty plans, which invariably replaced structural adjustment
plans. The question is whether they can provide useful remedies or whether
they simply push these countries further down the blind alley of generalised
quantifi cation.
The fi rst non-fi nancial objective to be quantifi ed as an internationally
binding target was the reduction in CO 2 emissions set out by the Kyoto

Protocol. This normative instrument emanating from the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Rio in
1992, was signed in 1997 and came into force in 2005. By 2010, it had been
ratifi ed by 168 countries, but not by China, nor by the United States. 81 Its
objective was to reduce over the period 2008 – 12 the emissions measured in
1990, by at least fi ve per cent. The method used here is a good illustration of
what is called the theory of property rights, 82 which works neither through
rules or levies, but by setting up a market in tradeable pollution rights. An
amendment adopted in Doha in December 2012 extended the period of
measurement to 2013 – 20, using this mechanism. However, the failure of
the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, and the desertion
of several countries which had initially signed the Protocol (Canada, Japan,
New-Zealand and Russia), have resulted in a mere 15 per cent of world CO 2
emissions being covered today by the agreement, and its very conception has
been discredited by the most reliable economists. 83

Assessing countries ’performance quantitatively also has a private sector
dimension, in the form of rating agencies which produce fi gures to describe
a country ’ s actual and projected fi nancial performance, and the trustworthiness
of its debt securities. The ratings in turn generate risk indicators
of variable sophistication. 84 Internationally, these agencies are only regulated
by a non-legally binding Code of Conduct, the Statement of Principles
Regarding the Activities of Credit Rating Agencies, adopted in 2003
by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOCV).
The EU favoured the principle of self-regulation for rating agencies up to
2006, but after the fi nancial markets crashed in 2008 it adopted a series
of regulations 85 designed to defi ne the activities of credit rating agencies,
Global Governance 163

in order to prevent confl icts of interest, 86 to guarantee the soundness of the
rating methods used and to have the agencies monitored by a European
Securities and Markets Authority, established in 2010. One of the lessons
of the fi nancial collapse of 2008 — the same lesson which should already
have been learnt from the Enron scandal (2001) regarding accounting practices
— was that governance by numbers gives immense power to those who
construct the fi gures, because this is conceived as a technical exercise which
need not be exposed to open debate. 87 The disasters we have seen recurring
are never ascribed to a design fault in the very mechanism used, but always
to human failings. Yet governance by numbers is itself a dead end, unsustainable
in the long run. It generates the return of new forms of allegiance
between people, as we shall see in the second part of this book.

represent the market price of inter-bank loans and to serve as a benchmark in a large number
of credit operations. The Libor rate is fi xed daily on the basis of the declarations made
by London banks on the borrowing costs practised between them. It came to light that several
of them had agreed a price between themselves, which led to Barclays Bank being fi ned
365 million euros in the British courts.

The Limits of Governance
by Numbers

If you try to improve the performance of a system of people, machines,
and procedures by setting numerical goals for the improvement of its
individual elements, the system will defeat your efforts and you
will be picking up the pieces where you least expect it. 1

BOTH GOVERNANCE BY numbers and government by laws pursue
the ideal of a society whose rules derive from an impersonal source
and not from the will of the powerful. However, governance by numbers
parts company with government by laws in its desire to liquidate all
heteronomy, including that of the law. When the law is the sovereign ruler, 2
its heteronomous authority, to which all are subject, is the primary condition
for the autonomy of the individuals it governs. The institution of language
has the same normative structure: language-speakers can express themselves
freely only if they have fi rst accepted the law of the language they speak;
we must obey the impersonal rules which refer certain signifi ers to certain
signifi eds in order to achieve the autonomy of thought and expression which
the mastery of a language gives us. Without this, we have no access to the
refl exive universe of (natural) language, in which we can observe ourselves
and speak, for example, about the rules which govern us. However, in natural
languages, there is no univocal link between signifi er and signifi ed, so a
statement is open to a multitude of possible interpretations.
Logico-mathematical language, by contrast, is univocal and non-refl exive.
The symbols used have one meaning, and one only, even if they can only
be discussed in the natural languages on which they are based. One of the
breakthroughs of modern mathematics was the coding of some of its own
formulas, in a movement of refl exivity which G ö del explored further in his
demonstrations that undecidable propositions exist — undecidable because
open to several possible interpretations. 3 Computing language rests on this

discovery, and the refl exivity of one program taking another as an item
of data. 4 Computers are thus self-governing machines, within the limits of
the programs they are running. Their invention made it possible to envisage
a society which functions according to immanent and impersonal rules,
that is, an inherently self-programming society purged of any heteronomy.
However, this notion of society as a machine had fi red the imagination of
Western legal thought for a long time, at least since Hobbes. 5 Governance
by numbers simply replaced the clock with a new fetishised object, the computer,
coupled to its vision of a self-regulating order in which subjection to
any over-arching laws is superfl uous. The radiant future promised by neoliberalism
conceives society as governed solely by the calculated utilities of
a host of contracting particles. Its basis is thus, as Karl Polanyi has called it,
pure ‘ economic solipsism ’ .
6
There are, however, solid reasons for doubting that this kind of future
will ever materialise. In its pursuit of the utopian dream of entirely calculable
norms, governance by numbers undermines the foundations of any
rational, scientifi c calculation. G ö del demonstrated that a formal system
built out of an indefi nite series of logically linked axioms will nevertheless
have an irreducible element of incalculability to it. And, as one of the people
whose discoveries led to the invention of computing, he was also one of
the fi rst to point out that the human mind is not reducible to a machine. 7
The mathematician Jean-Yves Girard characterised this position as follows:
‘ if we had to summarise in a single sentence the signifi cance of G ö del ’ s refutation
of Hilbert ’ s programme, it would be: ‘ there are things which cannot
be explained in terms of machines ’ .
8 Many scientists turn a deaf ear to the
implications of such discoveries, continuing to adhere to a mathematical
formalism, and a mechanistic and totalising vision, whose only advantage
is giving a simple and reductive access to the world. 9 Moreover, outside the
realm of mathematics, G ö del or Turing are the victims of the most fantastical
extrapolations. 10 This is only to be expected, since the scientifi c discoveries

of a particular period inevitably inform that period ’ s imaginary, including
ideas about how society should be governed. 11
To give some idea of the unsustainability of governance by numbers, we
shall fi rst look at its structural effects on the legal order, and then at the
latter ’ s inevitable resistance.

I. THE STRUCTURAL EFFECTS OF GOVERNANCE BY NUMBERS

Insofar as the legal order helps anchor in reality the image we have of the
world in which we live, and of what it could or should be, legal normativity
contributes to the institution of reason. This anthropological function
of the law can be achieved only if one respects at once the realities of the
world and human beings ’specifi c capacity to transform them. This is done,
in Proudhon ’ s words, by having ideas ‘ in the palm of one ’ s hand ’ .
12 Under a
Taylorist system, the capacity to refl ect on one ’ s actions was the privilege of
a minority of leaders (the bourgeoisie or the ‘ vanguard of the proletariat ’ ),
while the majority of workers were reduced to the status of cogs obeying
mechanically the rules of the workshop and the rhythms of the machines.
The dichotomy generated — between those whose role was to think and lead,
and those whose role was to obey without thinking — tends to disappear
under governance by numbers. This would be good news indeed, if only the
effect was to anchor managers ’thinking in real experience and to enable the
workers, who live this experience, to communicate what they think and put
it into action. However, governance by numbers produces quite the opposite
effect. Rather than release us from the fantasy of the governing machine, it
intensifi es this fantasy and ensnares managers and workers alike in feedback
loops governed by numerical representations of the world increasingly disconnected
from experience. Far from reconciling objectivity and subjectivity
in the conduct of human affairs, it impairs both by replacing the territory
with the map, and action with reaction.

II. THE ECLIPSE OF THE OBJECT: THE MAP REPLACES
THE TERRITORY

In theory, management by objectives claims to make a sharp distinction
between the time of action and the time of evaluation. The ‘ structure of
170 The Limits of Governance by Numbers

13 See above, ch 8 , p 146. 14 Cour des comptes, Rapport public annuel 2012, 605.

self-control ’which it champions thus in principle has three stages, comprising:
a) the setting of objectives; b) the actions carried out to meet these; and
c) the assessment of the performance, which itself, through feedback, serves
to redefi ne the future objectives or actions. However, the numerical indicators
used in c) to assess the performance are endowed with a normative
function, which results in a ‘ management of domination ’(rather than
self-management) which Peter Drucker ’ s governance by numbers expressly
warned against. 13 A confl ation between satisfying indicators and realising
objectives gives rise to what can be called an ‘ objective indicator’ , in which
two different meanings of ‘ objective ’are fused: as a noun it is a goal assigned
to an action, and as an adjective, it qualifi es the objectivity of a judgment
on reality. In any purely quantitative evaluation, this fusion of objectives
and indicators is inevitable, because the numbers are already informed by a
qualitative value which the assessor cannot modify.
A good example of this fusion occurs when research assessment methodologies
ignore the issue of how a piece of research contributes to furthering
knowledge, and instead assign value through bibliometric indicators,
according to the ranking of the journals in which the research is published.
The academic world, which was left unscathed by Taylorism, has become
the chosen playground of governance by numbers. Researchers in economics
are at the cutting edge of this replacement of judgement by calculation
in evaluation procedures. They are like the hero of Kafka ’ s Penal Colony,
applying management methods to themselves with the greatest rigour, and
advocating that they be applied to all domains of human existence. Thus,
in a report by the Cour des comptes, France ’ s highest budget auditor, the
Toulouse School of Economics is reported as having ‘ introduced a system of
payment “ on merit ” ’ , in order to ‘ reward excellence ’and the individual performances
of its researchers, ‘ based on awarding bonuses to the researchers
who publish in the 100 best economics journals’ (none of which are French).
A complex formula, based on the status of the article, the number of
co-authors, its volume and the journal ’ s ranking, gives an objective fi gure
for the bonus. The maximum bonus is awarded for articles published in one
of the top fi ve journals in the world. 14 With this kind of procedure, no one
actually needs to read the academic articles, and even less ask themselves
whether the real economy in the real world is any more intelligible or could
be better managed as a result, because a value judgement is already present
in the numerical ranking of the journals. All one has to do is calculate.
And that can be entrusted to a machine, to ensure the ‘ objectivity ’of the process.
The assessment as a whole thus exemplifi es something G ü nther Anders
noted half a century ago: the desire to ‘ transfer decision-making power to an
instrument (since the “ last word ”must be objective, and only the judgements

declared by objects are today considered to be “ objective ” ) ’ .
15 Despite harsh

criticism from some researchers, 16 not least mathematicians, 17 these procedures
are increasingly applied, and are used to decide on funding allocations
and the nature of the research to be undertaken. For example, in
the top Chinese universities, promotion for legal scholars is dependent on
their publications in a limited number of journals, all of which are in English.
In practice, they are thus encouraged to abandon any in-depth research
into legal systems other than common law ones (because any serious legal
research needs to work in the language of the legal system it is studying).
A university can thus improve its overall score only at the cost of considerably
impoverishing its real research capacities in comparative law.
On a much larger scale, the famous ‘ Shanghai Ranking ’has become
the standard by which all the universities in the world are assessed. This
Academic Ranking of World Universities, devised by researchers at the
Shanghai Jiao Tong University, respects the following weightings for calculating
a university ’ s rank: the number of Fields Medals and Nobel Prizes
among its members (20 per cent) and ex-students (10 per cent); the number
of researchers most quoted in their discipline (20 per cent); the number of
articles published in the journal Nature or Science (20 per cent), or which
have been indexed in the Science Citation Index or the Arts &Humanities
Citation Index (20 per cent); and the relation of these performances to the
size of the institution (10 per cent). 18 This ranking exerts an enormous
infl uence on higher education policy-makers, and drives the tendency to
ever-larger units: if all universities in France were fused into a single institution
called ‘ University of France ’ , this entity would — at least provisionally —
come top of the tables in any such global benchmarking operation. Arguably,
this system is the exact remake of the ‘ control fi gures ’which China inherited
from its socialist economic planning past. 19 The same causes continue to
produce the same (devastating) effects: through governance by numbers,
and the priority of calculation over judgment, decision-makers lose touch
with the real performances of institutions, and with the complexity of the
real. The map replaces the territory.

Left Behind ”aux É tats-Unis ’( ch 8fn 66) 13 – 26. 25 For the notion of statistical qualifi cation, see above, ch 5 , p 92.

This divorce from the real is evident in all the legal mechanisms employed
to implement governance by numbers. The Constitutional Bylaw LOLF
by which ‘ New Public Management ’was instituted in France created an
ocean of performance indicators divided into main groups (effi ciency indicators,
quality indicators and effectiveness indicators), whose common
denominator was that they were quantifi ed. 20 Thus, the text of the Decree of
29 August 2011, which generalised performance-related bonuses for civil
servants, states that ‘ defi ning a mechanism for collective performancerelated
bonuses involves fi xing 1. Objectives, indicators, and the results to
be achieved over 12 consecutive months. This period can form part of a
multi-annual programme of objectives ’ .
21 The sequence ‘ objectives, indicators,
and the results to be achieved ’is an indivisible whole. The circular
concerning the Decree ’ s application takes these different terms to be synonymous,
and the examples it gives of indicators for the ‘ quality of service
provided ’show that this quality must always be reduced to quantities:
‘ the proportion of sites or bodies inspected; the rate of implementation
of the rules applied to a policy; the rate of development of e-governance;
the level of user satisfaction; the processing times for requests; the average
time-frame for processing cases; the level of user information ’ .
22
As such, those involved will seek to achieve the targets, independently
of any real improvement in the services provided. This is one of the lessons
learnt from the American initiative we mentioned above, No Child Left
Behind.23 To improve their scores, the schools became less demanding in
their evaluations, and to improve their bonuses the teachers lowered their
teaching standards by ‘ cramming ’and teaching to the test, sometimes even
giving the pupils the answers in order to ensure good results. 24 There were
so many nefarious effects of the reform that, after the election of Barack
Obama to the presidency, there was a debate as to whether the legislation
was too profoundly fl awed, or whether it could still be reformed.
This disconnection from reality is also produced by the statistical qualifi
cation on which macro-economic indicators are built. 25 For example,
The Eclipse of the Object 173

26 On this indicator, see above, p 157ff . 27 See below, pp 263–64. 28 On the nefarious impact of the politics of numbers on democracy, see A Ogien , D é sacraliser
le chiffre dans l ’ é valuation du secteur public ( Versailles , Ed. Qae , 2013 ) 117 . 29 Eyraud, Le Capitalisme au c œ ur de l ’ É tat ( ch 8fn 55) 197 – 207.

in order to comply with the ‘ objective indicator ’of three per cent of the
GDP as the maximum public defi cit, 26 all one need do is transfer to the
private sector the defi cit accrued for services provided by the public sector.
For example, by consistently reducing the coverage of ‘minor risks’, French
public health insurance both shaves fi gures off its defi cit and automatically
boosts the private health insurance market. 27 The problem is that private
health insurance is not comprehensive — those who cannot afford it are not
covered — but it has the advantage of not showing up in the public accounts.
In other words, improving one ’ s score does not result in any real reduction
in expenditure — and it can have the opposite effect, as soaring opticians
’costs illustrate — and moreover it brings with it a decline of the level
of health protection in the population as a whole.
A similar logic, but on an international scale, informs the ‘ fi ghting poverty
’programmes, which in many countries have superseded years of
‘ structural adjustment ’ . ‘ Poverty ’is treated in this context as a numerical
indicator expressed in dollars, a piece of statistical information which can
be applied all over the world, like the occurrence of an epidemic or a natural
disaster. The defi nition of ‘ extreme poverty ’adopted by the United Nations
Millennium Goals, as living with less than 1 US $per day, excluded everything
which in a person ’ s standard of living and quality of life depends
on their social and cultural context, and cannot be assessed in fi nancial
terms. Although within a national framework it is possible for parliament or
trade unions to challenge this statistical representation of society, and thus
for its normative purchase to be monitored democratically, these checks do
not exist wherever numerical representations of society are endowed with
superior value and universality. The risk which emerges is that of becoming
enclosed in the self-referential loops of a technocratic discourse which irons
out the realities of human life rather than re-presenting them.
Despite the fact that these indicators are supposed to be the product of a
rational technical process, their construction involves power struggles which
are never the subject of democratic deliberation. 28 The sociologist Corine
Eyraud has described the negotiations between the French Treasury and
the Higher Education Ministry, as their civil servants fought it out to defi ne
higher education performance indicators. 29 For the academics, the indicators
proposed were those most likely to protect their budget allocations (for
example, the number of students registering); for the Treasury inspectors,
the indicators proposed were those most likely to be diffi cult to attain (for
example, pass rates at the end of the fi rst two university years), which could

show up some ‘ ineffi ciency ’on the part of the ‘ operators ’ . This is the type of
alchemy which transmutes university courses and research into fi gures, and
decides upon budget allocations accordingly. As for research, the indicators
constructed for use in the Annual Performance Reports (RAP) 30 are a good
illustration of how reality is expelled in favour of the imaginary products
of benchmarking. Programme No 150 of the Constitutional Bylaw LOLF,
concerning ‘ Higher Education training, and academic research ’ , has as its
Objective No 7 ‘ the Production of academic knowledge to the highest international
standard ’ , which is measured by indicator 7.1, ‘ Programme operators ’
academic production ’ . This indicator is arrived at by dividing the ‘ number of
internationally recognised publications by the programme operator ’ , by the
‘ EU-27 leading publications ’or the ‘ number of world-leading international
publications (global proportion) ’ .

This indicator therefore equates the progress of knowledge with a supposedly
measurable relative share of each programme operator ’ s ‘ output ’on an
international market of research ‘ products ’ . This type of ‘ objective indicator
’ , apart from being divorced from the real development of knowledge
areas, obliges research bodies to focus primarily on improving their rank
in this international benchmarking competition. Researchers are expected
to replace the activity of research with reactions to numerical signals: this
cannot but choke the wellspring feeding an individual ’ s research motivation,

of quantifi cation and mathematical symbols once promoted by researchers
now comes back to haunt them. This ‘ non-ontological ’use of quantifi
cation not only prevents the world of research from refl ecting on the
real in all its complexity, it also — particularly in economics — leads to sterile
simulations which from the start expel the real in favour of mathematical
representations. 33

III. THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUBJECT: ACTION
BOWS TO REACTION

Embracing the fi ction that people have property rights in their own bodies,
the law provided that a person ’ s ‘ labour force ’could be rented out just like a
cart-horse or a mill. Taylorism transposed this reifi cation into management,
by founding the ‘ scientifi c organisation ’of labour on the neutralisation of
the mental capacities of the worker. The employment contract gave legal
form to this divorce between the thinking subject (reduced to the fi gure of
the contracting party) and the work, emptied of subjective input (reduced
to a pure quantity of time in subordination). It was labour law which made
this fi ction bearable and sustainable, through the minimum physical and
economic security it afforded employees, so that they could maintain their
capacity to work over the longer period of a human life. Understood in
this light, the employment contract made it possible to institute a ‘ labour
market ’ , and thus brought to an end the two legal forms which had organised
the economy until then: the status of slave (which consigns work to the
realm of things, in qualifying the worker as himself a thing); and guild membership
status (which does the opposite, making work one of the elements
of a person ’ s identity). 34
Governance by numbers swept all this away by treating the human being
as an intelligent machine. Work ceased to be an energy source one owned
and could hire out to someone in return for subordination; it was no longer
an object or a thing separable from the contracting subject. Rather, governance
decrees a new type of subject, the programmed subject, capable of
self-objectifi cation. The programmed worker is an ‘ objective subject ’ , motivated
entirely by calculated interest, and capable of adapting in real time
to variations in the environment in order to meet the objectives assigned to
him or her. In legal terms, this new fi gure of the worker impacts upon the

binding force of the contract. The employment contract made it possible to
treat work as a negotiable object, of which the counterpart was the employee
’ s qualifi cation as a contracting party. This role provided a minimum of
legal protection: for example, employers cannot reduce employees ’salary
or increase their working hours without their consent. This ‘ rigidity ’of the
work contract — not to be confused with the ‘ rigidity ’of the law, the target
of neoliberalism ’ s obsessive attacks — puts a brake on the logics of governance,
which require ‘ a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce and labour
markets responsive to economic change, with a view to achieving the objectives
defi ned ’(Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 145).
In other words, governance requires what today we would call ‘ fl exibility ’
(a term borrowed from materials science). ‘ Flexible ’arrangements were previously
confi ned to legal provisions and collective agreements, but recent
reforms in France have extended such arrangements to individual employment
contracts through the possibility of company-wide agreements on lowering
salaries or on enforced geographical mobility. 35 A new type of legal
tie emerges here, which, unlike the contract, does not bear on a given quantity
of work, measured in time and money, but on the very person of the
worker. Since the worker ’ s ‘ reactivity ’and ‘ fl exibility ’are incompatible with
the binding force of the contract, governance will necessarily strip workers
of some of the attributes of a contracting party.
This programmed working subject runs a risk unknown to the previous
industrial revolutions: that of harm to mental health. 36 Under Fordism,
workers might lose their physical health and sometimes their lives, 37 their
work was back-breaking and dull, but they did not risk losing their minds.
A legal analysis can outline quite precisely the emergence and spread of this
new risk. Its fi rst appearance in the French Labour Code was in 1991, and
mental and behavioural disturbances were fi rst added to the ILO ’ s list of
occupational diseases in 2010. Reports by occupational health doctors of
cases of suicide in the workplace began trickling in towards the end of the
1990s. 38 The numbers have increased in recent years, not only in Europe

isolated case — was the suicide of 11 young employees, in the fi rst quarter of 2010 alone, on

(especially France), but also in emerging countries which have imported
the same methods of work organisation (especially China). 39 As well as suicide,
increased stress and nervous breakdowns attributable to working conditions
have been observed. 40 But these new forms of dehumanisation of work
are not inevitable, nor are they the price to pay for technological progress.
On the contrary, the new information technologies can be an amazing liberatory
force, when they allow people to concentrate on the most creative part
of their work, that is, the most poietic part, in the original sense of the term.
Our new computing tools could be the chance to wrest work from the stultifying
activity it was under Taylorism. But this will be impossible as long as
one conceives of the worker as a kind of computer rather than conceiving of
the computer as a way of humanising work. The worker under governance
by numbers is enclosed in a form of virtual reality, obliged to react in ‘ real
time ’ , and assessed by performance indicators divorced from the conditions
under which the work is actually carried out. Work then ceases to be the
most signifi cant way in which human beings realise their involvement with
the world ’ s realities, one which allows them to exercise — and not lose —
their minds. Instead, workers are trapped into a system of signifi ers without
signifi eds, in which performance requirements keep rising, while at the same
time any real capacity to act is confi scated, that is, the capacity to act freely
on the basis of one ’ s own professional experience and within a work community
united around the task to be carried out. Taylorism was based on
the total subordination of workers to a rationalised system imposed from
outside, whereas today the organisation of work is predicated on programming.
Through massive use of psycho-technical methods, the disciplinary
practices previously applied to the body are now applied to the worker ’ s
mind. 41 Work outcomes are mostly measured by numerical indicators, but
subjects need to be implicated in the process in order to react positively to
the discrepancies revealed between their own performance and the assigned
objectives. This is why in large organisations a particular management technique
quickly became standard practice: the individual performance review.
Robert Castel was the fi rst to point out that this extension of corporal disciplinary
techniques to the mind was something new. He called it ‘ therapy for

normal people ’ .
42 The idea, in management theory, is to enable employees

‘ to give meaning to their work and understand their place in the company ’ ,
and to enable the company ‘ to mobilise people ’ s maximum commitment,
as the source of their performance ’ .
43 This is simply the good old judicial
and religious technique of confession, repackaged for economic ends. But
whereas confession instated the subject as capable of assuming his or her
conduct, today ’ s psycho-therapeutic interview does the opposite, generating
dependence and disempowerment, as Gladys Swain and Marcel Gauchet
have shown, 44 as well as a number of medically recognised pathogenic
effects. 45
The conversion of the subject into a reactive object characterises
governance by numbers more generally. In the fi ght against poverty, which
we mentioned above, local knowledge and skills are never mobilised to
conceive, but only to implement plans. Local researchers are not involved
in formulating the issues raised by the everyday living conditions of their
fellow citizens, but to fi ll out questionnaires conceived in advance by
international organisations. Yet the situation is not so different in France.
‘ The poor ’ — unlike the rich — are endlessly profi led as objects of the social
sciences, and as objective — but also, it is hoped, reactive — subjects of ‘ Back
to work ’programmes. It is only quite exceptionally that they are genuinely
treated as subjects, and consulted on their own experience of poverty. 46
Moreover, the changes occurring in the legal subject do not only affect
natural persons, but also companies. They too are treated as ‘ objective subjects
’ , and are enslaved to the programmed signals they receive to achieve
certain results. Today, every company over a certain size is both a subject
operating on the markets and an object of market speculation. The company
yoked to short-term fi nancial goals experiences the entropic time of
the disorganisation of organisations. 47 Its visions for the future collapse,
as does the quality of its products. Although still an economic subject, it is
pre-programmed, vulnerable to becoming a dispossessed object, in the most

(the ‘ Troika ’comprises the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central
Bank). The Troika ’ s operations were unreservedly criticised by the European Parliament in two
resolutions voted on 13 March 2014: one, the Inquiry into the role and activities of the Troika
(P7_TA-PROV(2014)0239), and the other, the Inquiry into the social aspects of the role and
operations of the Troika (P7_TA-PROV(2014)0240) in the Eurozone countries (Reports available
at www.europarl.europa.eu ).

technical sense of the term. This possibility of dispossession was enacted
in France by the Loi Strauss-Kahn of 2 July 1998, 48 which destroyed a
centuries-old mainstay of commercial law, that a company is forbidden to
buy back its own shares. The justifi cation for shareholders ’receipt of dividends
was that they helped fi nance the joint stock company ’ s operations.
But when companies are allowed to buy their own shares to increase their
value artifi cially for their shareholders, the bond of obligation is inverted,
with shareholders getting richer at the expense of the company. 49 The 1998
reform was a gift from heaven for a certain category of shareholders who
are indifferent to a company ’ s entrepreneurial capacity (its long-term economic
viability) and who want only to rake in the maximum amount of
money in the shortest possible time. 50 In other words, this change in legislation
privileged speculation over investment. And after the fi nancial crisis
of 2008, when central banks fl ooded the fi nancial markets with liquidity in
the hope of restarting the economy, a large part of these sums was used by
multinationals to repurchase their own stock in order to enrich their shareholders,
making even Bloomberg raise an eyebrow. 51
Lastly, governance by numbers transforms states themselves — those sovereign
subjects par excellence— into ‘ objective subjects ’which no longer
act freely, but react to numerical signals. The imposition on countries of
structural adjustment programmes, supposedly to bring their budgets back
into balance, embodies this loss of sovereignty. In the Eurozone countries
in particular, these programmes have subjected the work of nations to
the same sort of ‘ scientifi c rationality ’as work in a business, according to
principles which are never open to political debate. The activities of the
Troika 52 in Europe have shown that if one thinks that managing a country
and managing a company are one and the same thing, then it is not only
conceivable but even essential, if a fi nancial crisis strikes, to put the country

into receivership and liquidate its assets, 53 since one cannot sack its inhabitants.
Within that logic, turning to the electorate will naturally be deemed as
‘ irresponsible ’as letting a bankrupt entrepreneur continue to run his or her
business. 54 Governance by numbers thus dispossesses not only companies
and individuals, but entire populations.
And since human beings are not computers, and can never be entirely
programmed or objectifi ed, they are either driven to mental illness and suicide,
or they start playing the numbers game themselves, with their own
ends in view. Unlike machines, they are quick to understand that satisfying
indicators is an irrebuttable presumption with respect to meeting objectives.
Val é ry remarked that ‘ Monitoring an action anyway corrupts and perverts
it [ … ], for whenever an action is monitored, the subject ’ s deeper motivation
ceases to be the performance of the action itself, but rather the control,
and how to get round it ’ .
55 Soviet planning provides an endless supply
of examples in which, in order to meet the objective of, say, doubling the
length of material produced annually by a particular factory, exactly the
same length was produced — but at half the width. Or, in order to meet
the quotas for the production of boots, but without an adequate supply
of leather, factories simply produced boots in cardboard or only in small
sizes. 56 Or again, in order to boost the bibliometric scores used to measure
performance, researchers can make four articles out of what they would
otherwise have published as a single article, or even cheat with their sources
and falsify the results. 57 Receptionists who know that their performance is
measured by the number of inquirers whose calls are not answered before
the fi fth ring, will programme their phones to pick up automatically after
the third ring, thus improving their scores under ‘ quality of service provided

in Africa, Ousmane O Sidib é , with his excellent knowledge of
facts on the ground in Mali, recounts how the international funders fi rst
had a large number of teachers fi red, as dictated by the programme, but
then conditioned their aid upon improving schooling rates (as a component

of the human development indicator). 58 In order to successfully square this
circle, the African countries in question hastily recruited a mass of unqualifi
ed and underpaid stand-in teachers, who dispensed their classes without
pedagogical aids in warehouses fi lled to bursting. ‘ Progress ’ , in the terms of
the indicator, was thus achieved at the cost of impoverished education for
generations of children and adolescents. Deprived of their traditional modes
of transmission of knowledge and culture, these groups had no access to a
school system worthy of the name either. When meeting targets becomes the
goal of a piece of work, not only does this defl ect from productive activity
(more and more time is spent entering the required performance information),
but it also disconnects the work from the realities of the world, and
replaces these with a numerical image constructed dogmatically.

IV. THE LAW ’ S RESISTANCE

While the law is overrun by governance by numbers, and lends it normative
force, it also resists this invasion, and has developed what can be called
immune defences against it. These defences are structural, because the legal
form, a tripartite arrangement, cannot be totally absorbed into the universe of
governance by numbers, which has a binary structure. As long as the law
resists, it carves out areas of freedom, however reduced these may be.
Alexander Zinoviev has shown how this works, in terms which refl ect his
thinking as a mathematician and a logician. In his work The Yawning Heights,
he imagines a conversation in a text, A, which can be characterised as hostile
to the status quo (an ‘ anti- ’text) when a system of legal rules, B, is applied to it.
The author N of text A is liable for prosecution. But, Zinoviev asks,

How characterise a text ‘ N affi rms that A ’ , from the viewpoint of B ?Might it
itself be ‘ anti- ’ ?Alright, but then how about the prosecutor when he accuses me
in court of maintaining that ‘ N affi rms that A ’ ?Will he be accused in turn of
expressing a text which is ‘ anti- ’ ?Why not ?What formal criterion can distinguish
between us ?True, I used the term ‘ affi rm ’once, and the prosecutor will use it
twice. If this were made into law, all I would have to do is declare in advance the
following text: ‘ M affi rms that N affi rms that A ’[ … ] Draw up a code B which
contains laws by which texts may be qualifi ed as ‘ anti- ’ , and I bet you that, using
any ‘ anti- ’text, I will be able to write a text which cannot be judged ‘ anti- ’by B,
but which will anyway be understood as the text of an opponent. All legality is a
priori the possibility of its infringement. 59

Communist society obeyed its own normative system which was not, according
to Zinoviev, a system of law: ‘ the norms governing people ’ s conduct do

not correspond to legal principles, but rather to reason of State, the interests
of particular groups or of the whole country. Power is the only judge ’ .
60
The law ’ s formalism resisted the fundamental principles and the very nature
of power in a Communist society. When the regime of governance by numbers
contradicts too starkly democratic principles and fundamental rights,
not least the right to physical and mental integrity, a legal analysis can precisely
lay bare this form of resistance.

V. THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLE

Despite the optimistic claims of those who identify democracy with quantifi
cation, 61 when governance by numbers takes hold it limits democracy.
This is an essential part of Hayek ’ s thought, when — in the footsteps of
Lenin — he calls for a ‘ dethroning of politics ’ .
62 In the eyes of neoliberals,
citizens should not meddle with the organisation of the economy because:

To them [an ever-increasing part of the population of the Western World] the
market economy is largely incomprehensible; they have never practised the
rules on which it rests, and its results seem to them irrational and immoral. [ … ]
Their demand for a just distribution in which organized power is to be used to
allocate to each what he deserves, is thus strictly an atavism, based on primordial
emotions. 63

This is why Hayek ’ s battle-cry was ‘ The last struggle against arbitrary
power is still ahead of us — the fi ght against socialism and for the abolition
of all coercive power to direct individual efforts and deliberately to distribute
its results ’ .
64 This idea that economic calculations must be removed
from democratic inspection was also advocated by the great Italian statistician
active under Mussolini, Corrado Gini, the inventor of the coeffi cient
which bears his name. The title of an article of his leaves no room for doubt:
‘ The Scientifi c Basis of Fascism ’ .
65 And one could also mention General
Pinochet ’ s Chile, where Hayek ’ s neoliberal theses were fi rst tried out on a
large scale, eliciting his remark that ‘ Personally, I prefer a liberal dictatorship
The Democratic Principle 183

to a democratic government from which all liberalism is absent ’ .
66 And

indeed, a shining example of the thriving association between the market
economy and dictatorship is today ’ s China, which — in a particularly apt
formulation — calls itself a ‘ democratic dictatorship ’ . The First Article of
its Constitution states that ‘ The People ’ s Republic of China is a Socialist
State of popular democratic dictatorship governed by the working class and
founded on the alliance between workers and peasants ’ .
As for the EU, although it restricts democracy in a much less brutal way,
it nevertheless shields its economic policies from electoral scrutiny by putting
power into the hands of non-elected bodies. And for the last 20 years
or so, it has become something of a habit for EU leaders to respect electoral
results only if they correspond to what they hoped for: the rejection of the
Maastricht Treaty by Danish voters, of the Treaty of Nice by the Irish, of the
Constitutional Treaty by French, Dutch and Irish voters, and of the Treaty
of Lisbon by the Irish (twice) was simply passed over. In addition, when the
Greek Prime Minister declared he would call a referendum, in 2011, on the
structural adjustment programme designed by the Troika to reduce Greece ’ s
public defi cit in accordance with certain numerical objectives, he was forbidden
to do so.
These infringements of national sovereignty come on top of the restrictions
already required of Member States by the construction of the
European Union. In themselves, these restrictions of national sovereignty
pose no threat to democracy as long as European institutions can guarantee
the same democratic process as national ones. But this is far from being
the case. The ‘ democratic defi cit ’of the EU has become so fl agrant that it
even drove the German Constitutional Court to issue a word of warning
in its decision concerning the ratifi cation of the Treaty of Lisbon. 67 Its
decision — largely ignored or caricatured in France — is in fact a legal turning
point in the history of the construction of the EU, and is worth dwelling on.
The Court began by recalling what is meant by a democracy. It is a regime in
which ‘ the exercise of public authority is subject to the majority principle of
regularly forming accountable governments and an unhindered opposition,
which has an opportunity to come into power ’ .
68 In a democracy,

the people must be able to determine government and legislation in free and equal
elections. This core content may be complemented by plebiscitary voting on factual
issues [ … ]. In a democracy, the decision of the people is the focal point of the
formation and retention of political power: Every democratic government knows
the fear of losing power by being voted out of offi ce. 69
184 The Limits of Governance by Numbers

70 ibid, §288. 71 ibid, §289.

Having spelt out its understanding of democracy, the Court compares it
with the workings of the European Union. There are two points in its lapidary
conclusion. First, that in the current state of European Treaties the
European Parliament is unable to guarantee democratic representation of
European citizens:

Measured against the requirements of a Constitutional State, even after the entry
into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union lacks a political decisionmaking
body based on equal elections by all citizens of the Union and able to uniformly
represent the will of the people. In addition, connected with this fi rst failing
is the lack of a system of organisation of political rule in which the expression of a
European majority leads to the formation of the government sustained by free and
equal electoral decisions and thus enabling genuine competition, transparent for citizens,
between government and opposition. Even in the new wording of Article 14.2
of the Lisbon Treaty on European Union (TEU), and contrary to the claim that
Article 10.1 seems to make through its wording, the European Parliament is not a
representative body of a sovereign European people.

Representation of citizens in the European Parliament is not linked to the equality
of citizens of the Union (Article 9 Lisbon TEU), but to nationality, a criterion that
is actually an absolutely prohibited distinction for the European Union.

(2 BvE 2/08, Judgment of the Second Senate of 30 June 2009, § §280, 287)

As though to add salt to the wound, the German Constitutional Court also
dwells upon the fact that the Lisbon Treaty itself violates the grand principles
it proclaims at the outset, such as equality between European citizens (TEU,
Article 9) or the claim that ‘ the functioning of the Union shall be founded
on representative democracy ’(TEU, Article 10.1). So if one introduced the
principle of ‘ one man one vote ’into elections for the European Parliament,
would that wipe out the democratic defi cit ?No, says the German Constitutional
Court, because — and this is the Court ’ s second point — the European
Parliament ’ s legislative power would still be shared with bodies which have
no democratic legitimacy, namely the Council, the Commission and the
Court of Justice of the European Union. The latter, says the German Court
in passing, obeys the principle of ‘ one state, one judge ’ , and is thus ‘ under
the determining infl uence of Member States ’ .
70 In other words, it neither
represents European citizens, nor is it independent of governments. Which is
why the Constitutional Court concludes that the democratic defi cit can neither
be offset, nor justifi ed, by other provisions in the Treaty: ‘ The defi cit of
European public authority that exists when measured against requirements
of democracy in states cannot be compensated for by other provisions of the
Treaty of Lisbon and, to that extent, it cannot be justifi ed ’ .

The democratic principle ’ s resistance through law is also evident at an
international level, on social-democratic issues. For example, the ILO Committee
on Freedom of Association condemned the fact that Trade Unions
were excluded from consultations when the European Troika imposed a
programmed reduction of social rights on the Greek government. 72

VI. THE EMPLOYER ’ S LIABILITY FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY

The new risks to mental health which governance by numbers generates
in the workplace have been addressed — without much effect to date — in
negotiations between the social partners, under the title of ‘ stress at work ’ ,
73
and through legislative action around ‘ psychological harassment ’ .
74 But, in
France, case law is what has really entrenched the employer ’ s responsibility
for achieving results ( l ’ obligation de s é curit éde r é sultat) in the domain of
health and safety, 75 and has led to restrictions on the use of new management
techniques in companies. 76 New notions, implying a qualitative approach
to work, have emerged in this context: the ‘ hardhip ’( la p é nibilit é ) 77 and
the ‘ physical or mental burden ’( la charge physique ou nerveuse) of work. 78
More generally, the use of new digital and biological technologies to check
up on and observe employees has been contained by legislation and case
law. 79 The Cour de Cassation has also set limits on the proliferating use

of new objectives-based management and evaluation techniques in companies.
80 It validated, for example, the idea that psychological harassment
could be inherent to certain management methods, independently of any
intention to harm. 81 And it gave the judge the right to suspend ways of
organising work which were likely to compromise the mental health of
employees. 82 More recently, it criticised a certain practice of ranking, in
which assessors divide the staff into graded groups, each group containing
a predetermined percentage of employees. 83 Some employees are thus
inevitably downgraded, whatever the quality of their work. In the words
of the Court, ‘ A system of assessment based on pre-set quotas, even if they
are meant to be only indicative, in order to divide employees into different
groups, necessarily implies using criteria which are unrelated to the evaluation
of the employee ’ s professional skills ’ .
A ruling by the Tribunal de grande instance in Lyon in 2012 84 illustrates
how the notion of the employer ’ s obligations regarding employees ’health
and safety can be invoked to resist new managerial techniques. The ruling
prevented a bank from introducing a staff performance management system
based on benchmarks. The constant assessment of employees was to have
been organised as follows:

Every branch [ … ] has its performances analysed by comparison, and hence in
competition, with the performances of other branches; within, and independently
of, each branch, the performance of each employee is examined in relation to
the performance of the other employees; no objective is imposed offi cially on the
branches or the employees, except that of doing better than the others; no one
can know at the end of any given day whether he or she has worked well or not,
because the assessed quality of his work will depend primarily on the results of
the others; in such a system, one starts from zero again every day, which creates
a permanent state of stress, especially since computers allow everyone to follow,
from any terminal, the live performance of every member of the sales team for the
whole bank.

The health and safety inspector ’ s report was ratifi ed by the Court, which
concluded that this sort of system was likely to have the following effects:

— the infringement of dignity, since employees are permanently devalued
in order to generate ongoing competition between them.
— a feeling of instability because employees cannot situate themselves in
relation to annual targets since one ’ s personal results are conditioned
by those of all the others.

Complaints Nos 65/2011 and 66/2011.

— a constant sense of guilt because of the individual ’ s responsibility in the
results of the group.
— a feeling of shame because one has privileged selling a product over
advising the client.
— a pernicious encouragement to break the rules in order to boost the
fi gures.
— increased occurrences of physical and mental disturbances among
employees.

The bank ’ s defence was that it had intended to set up a ‘ pscyho-social risks
observatory ’ , a free helpline, and a ‘ work quality ’action plan. This argument
was dismissed by the Court, which observed that such measures, aimed
at dealing after the fact with foreseeable hazards which had already materialised,
did not meet the employer ’ s obligations to achieve results regarding
employees ’health and safety. It accordingly forbade the company from
introducing this way of organising work. This judgment now forms part
of the Cour de Cassation ’ s case law, and it enables judges to ban modes of
organisation or assessment of work which it considers dangerous.
Since health protection has always been the backbone of social legislation,
it is hardly surprising that the resistance of the law to the penetration of governance
by numbers should express itself most forcefully in this area. This
resistance has a particularly powerful purchase because it obliges the issue of
the organisation of work to be situated once again as an issue of social justice,
whereas the Fordist compromise had precisely excluded it. Historically,
social legislation developed in concentric circles around measures to protect
the bodies of women and children — the core physical resources of the nation.
Today, a similar movement could be generated to take measures to protect
the nation ’ s core intellectual resources. Already the resistance of the law to
governance by numbers has surfaced in fi elds other than physical protection.
For example, in October 2012, certain measures taken by the Greek government,
under pressure from the European Troika, were condemned by the
European Committee of Social Rights (the body which monitors compliance
with the Council of Europe ’ s Social Charter). The Committee stated that

a greater employment fl exibility in order to combat unemployment and encourage
employers to take on staff, should not result in depriving broad categories
of employees, particularly those who have not had a stable job for long, of their
fundamental rights under labour law, which protect them from arbitrary decisions
by their employers and from fl uctuating economic circumstances. 85

But the immune defences mobilised by the law in order to resist governance
by numbers lead to a profound transformation of the legal order itself.
As we shall see in the following chapter, the law is forced to adapt in order
to survive.

The Withering-Away of the State

The State is not ‘ abolished ’ ; it dies out. 1

THE REGIME OF governance by numbers dismantles the legal order
most effectively through its subordination of the public sphere to
private interests. Since calculations of individual utility are the lynchpin
of this type of governance, the only heteronomous rules admitted as
legitimate are, at best — in the case of ordoliberalism — those which ensure
that calculations are dependable: the rules of private law. Any intrusion by
the state into the sphere of these computations in the name of the ‘ general
interest ’is immediately considered suspect. This inversion of the hierarchy
between public and private is the outcome of a long history which started
with expelling the res publica from the sphere of the sacred and replacing it
with a purely technicist conception of norms.

I. THE SACRED NATURE OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE

Contrary to what one might imagine, the public – private distinction does
not originate with the Enlightenment, but comes down to us from the very
matrix of both continental law and common law traditions, the Code of
Justinian ( Corpus iuris civilis). In the Code ’ s best-known formulation,
penned by Ulpian, ‘ there are two branches [ positiones] of legal study: public
and private law. Public law is that which respects the establishment [ statum]
of the Roman commonwealth, private law that which respects individuals ’
interests ’ .
2 Today this distinction is understood as an opposition between
two bodies of rules (as the translation by ‘ branches ’suggests), whereas at
stake are actually different positions of the same corpus of rules. 3 The body
The Sacred Nature of the Public Sphere 189

abandonment of the notion of ‘ position ’in favour of ‘ opposition ’between public and private,
see G Chevrier , ‘ Remarques sur l ’ introduction et les vicissitudes de la distinction du “ jus privatum
”et du “ jus publicum ”dans les œ uvres des anciens juristes fran ç ais ’( 1952 ) Archives de
philosophie du droit, 5 – 77 .
4 See Legendre, ibid. 5 ‘ some matters being of public, others of private interest. Public law covers sacred things,
the priesthood, and offi ces of the state ’ . ( ‘ Sunt enim qu æ dam publice utilia, qu æ dam privatim.
Publicum jus in sacris, in sacerdotibus, in magistratibus consistit ’ ), Digest, op. cit. ch 2, n 23. 6 We should therefore attribute the criticisms made by certain French politicians of Art 6
of the new Tunisian constitution to ignorance of their own constitutional roots. Article 6 guarantees
at once religion, the protection of the sacred, freedom of conscience and belief, and
freedom of worship.

of law ( corpus iuris) can link two different positions because the mutual
adjustment of private interests in the horizontal plane and the stability
( status) of public institutions in the vertical one are interdependent: the
former depends on the latter. In other words, the res publica must stand tall
if relations between individuals are to be governed by the rule of law and
not by the ‘ law ’of the strongest. The subordination of the private to the
public realm is what makes legal systems intelligible and dependable.
This institutional confi guration is the West ’ s response to an anthropological
dilemma confronted by all human civilisations. In their vital need
to metabolise society ’ s potential for violence, they refer power to an origin
which both legitimates and limits it. 4 The containment of individual interests
necessarily depends on the establishment of a res publica, which is the
bearer of what Ulpian calls ‘ sacred things ’ .
5 Today we would call the latter
the ‘ founding prohibitions ’in which each legal system expresses its own
particular axiological principles. The reference to the sacred, understood in
these terms, has in no way disappeared from our own founding texts. It is
present in the 1789 Declaration in its proclamation of the ‘ natural, sacred
and inalienable rights of man ’ , and the ‘ inviolable and sacred ’right to property.
And it was solemnly reaffi rmed at the end of the Second World War in
the Preamble to the French Constitution of 1946, which provides that ‘ each
human being, without distinction of race, religion or creed, possesses sacred
and inalienable rights ’ . This same sacred character is also implicitly affi rmed
by the declared intangibility of certain constitutional principles. For example,
in Germany ’ s Basic Law, Article 79 places the principle of dignity, and
the federal, democratic and social nature of the state, beyond the reach of the
constituants. 6 This articulation of the sphere of the general interest with
that of individual interests has underpinned legal systems as varied as those
of Classical Rome, the monarchies of the Ancien R é gime, nation states and
colonial empires. Over the last 200 years, it has expanded spectacularly
successful across the whole world, in step with Western domination, and has

forced onto the defensive other ways of civilising power, such as Asian 7 and
African 8 ritualism, or Jewish 9 and Muslim religious legalism.
The modern state is thus heir to ‘ the establishment [ statum] of the Roman
res publica’ , which it fi gures as an immortal being capable of ensuring
respect for ‘ self-evident ’truths and ‘ unalienable and sacred rights, ’and of
giving lasting continuity to a people over the generations. However, a whole
swathe of Western thought since the Enlightenment has sought to eradicate
the dogmatic dimension of this institutional confi guration, and to found the
legal order on ‘ laws of nature ’ . Consideration of ‘ sacred things ’has been
relegated to the private sphere of ‘ religious feeling ’ , leaving a purely instrumental
conception of the law.

II. THE ‘ SCIENTIFIC ’GOVERNMENT OF HUMAN BEINGS

The totalitarian regimes which fl ourished in the twentieth century were
the fi rst to claim that they had freed the law, and state institutions, from
any trace of metaphysics. They claimed to anchor them in the ‘ true laws ’
discovered by racial biology or scientifi c socialism. From this scientistic perspective,
relations between individuals are not subordinated to a public law
which is itself grounded in ‘ sacred things ’ , but are dictated by a truth inherent
in the power relations between races or classes.
Nazism, for example, in its pursuit of the advent of a ‘ master race ’destined
to dominate all others, referred to laws derived from the biology of its
time. 10 ‘ We shape the life of our people and our legislation in accordance
with the verdicts of genetics ’ , the Hitler Youth Manual proclaimed. 11 For
Hitler, ‘ The State is only the means to an end. The end is: conservation of
the race ’ .
12 Law is here entirely confl ated with the will of the strongest or,
in Goering ’ s hedonist version, ‘ Recht ist das, was uns gef ä llt’( ‘ Law is what
it pleases us to dispose ’ ). Instead of simply obeying laws as laid down, the
‘ healthy ’citizen ’ s duty was to examine and even anticipate the will of the
F ü hrer, who set the goals to be attained rather than the rules to be observed.
The ‘Scientifi c’ Government of Human Beings 191

13 According to the views Hitler expounded in a speech held in Weimar in July 1936, the
Party ’ s task was to govern and to legislate, while that of the state was to administer. But this
formal distinction had no real practical purchase, because the Party controlled everything at all
levels ( cf E Fraenkel , The Dual State: A Contribution to the Theory of Dictatorship ( Oxford,
Oxford University Press 1941, reprint Clark, New-Jersey, Lawbook Exchange , 2006 ) XV . 14 Decree of 28 February 1933, suspending the fundamental rights guaranteed by the
Weimar Constitution. 15 Schmitt, who had no time for the concept of ‘ rule of law ’( Etat de droit), attempted to
accommodate the Nazi regime ’ s concern for respectability by forging the concept of German
Rule of Law of Adolf Hitler ( cf M Stolleis , ‘ Que signifi ait la querelle autour de l ’ É tat de droit
sous le Troisi è me Reich ? ’in O Jouanjan(ed) Figures de l ’ É tat de droit ( Strasbourg, Presses
universitaires Strasbourg , 2001 ) 378 ). 16 cf E Fraenkel (n 13) 9 – 56; W Ebenstein , The Nazi State ( New York City , Farrare &
Rinehart , 1943 ) 3f ; M Stolleis , The Law under the Swastika. Studies on Legal history in Nazi
Germany ( Chicago , University of Chicago Press , 1998 ) 263 ; O Jouanjan , ‘ Prendre le discours
juridique nazi au s é rieux ? ’( 2003 ) 1 Revue interdisciplinaire d ’ é tudes juridiques, 70, 1 – 23 ;

Dutt( New York City , International Publishers, c 1939 ) .

The Single Party made sure that no one could ignore the F ü hrer ’ s will, and
the state was simply a tool at his disposal. 13 Loyalty to a person thus supplanted
obedience to the law. From this perspective, it was logical that the
National Socialist regime ’ s only constitution should be martial law. 14 This
transformation of a state of exception into the very foundation of the legal
order corresponded to Carl Schmitt ’ s theories, 15 which disregard whether
political power is bound by a founding legal rule or not, and thus refuse to
distinguish between a totalitarian state and a state governed by the rule of
law. 16 This stance is of the same order as the refusal to distinguish between
reason and madness, and the totalitarian state is indeed a state of madness,
as writers as divergent as Orwell and Ionesco have shown.
For the Marxist-Leninist totalitarian regime, the true laws of history
would bring about a society without class and without law, as a result of
the transformation of the society ’ s economic base. Since ‘ bourgeois ’laws
were simply there to serve class domination, it was imperative, in order to
hasten this historical change, to make the legal form itself wither away, and
to eliminate all legal guarantees that might hinder the advent of the scientifi c
government of human beings. This vision of a world purged of the political
in favour of the technical was dear to the fathers of Marxism. Already for
Engels, once the proletarian revolution was achieved,

State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfl
uous. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things,
and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not ‘ abolished ’ .
It dies out. 17

The Maoist regime took this further than most, especially during the Cultural
Revolution. And many of its former followers have now quite naturally
turned up among the theorists of anarcho-capitalist ‘ deregulation ’ , in China
and the West alike.
192 The Withering-Away of the State

18 On the post-war rehabilitation of dogma, see my Spirit of Philadelphia. Social Justice vs
the Total Market, tr S Brown( London/ New York City , Verso , 2012 ) . 19 D Hume , Treatise on Human Nature, Section VI, ‘ Some Farther Refl ections Concerning
Justice and Injustice ’in Philosphical Works ( Edinburgh , 1826 ) II, 302 . 20 See FA Hayek , Law, Legislation and Liberty: A New Statement of the Liberal Principles
of Justice and Political Economy, Volume 2: The Mirage of Social Justice ( Chicago , University
of Chicago Press , 1973 ) .

However, seeking to base a political regime on science is perfectly illusory.
The system of law underlies scientifi c research, and not the other way
round. Without a legal basis, which endows science with value, and protects
it, it cannot develop freely. Indeed, nowhere is it more threatened than in a
system founded on an offi cial ‘ scientifi c ’truth. The regimes which, over the
last 100 years, have claimed to rest on scientifi c foundations (racial biology
or scientifi c socialism, for instance) are also those which have muzzled
scientifi c endeavour by forbidding any research which might contradict
them. This is an interesting lesson because it proves that science cannot
ground itself. Moreover, human laws always end up getting the better of the
pseudo-scientifi c ones to which these political regimes refer. Western nations
were obliged to accept the categorical imperative of respect for human dignity,
after the Second World War, as the basis on which they would agree
to collaborate in the establishment of a new worldwide legal order which
could further social justice. 18 This entailed the proclamation of a ‘ new generation
’of human rights — economic, social and cultural. Since these needed
state intervention for their implementation, the Western European social
state underwent a period of unprecedented growth.
However, this imperative that economic transactions should work
towards social justice did not survive the upheavals of the last three decades.
The neo-conservative revolution brought back a belief in the existence
of super-human forces — market forces this time — capable of generating a
self-regulating ‘ spontaneous order ’ . Centuries previously, Hume likewise
thought he had discovered the ultimate grounds on which law and morals
could be based. In his Treatise Of Human Nature (1740) — whose sub-title
clearly conveys its scientifi c pretentions: ‘ Being An Attempt to introduce
the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects ’ — he identifi ed
‘ three fundamental laws of nature ’on which the government of human societies
should be based: ‘ We have now run over the three fundamental laws
of nature, that of the stability of possession, of its transference by consent,
and of the performance of promises. It is on the strict observance of those
three laws, that the peace and security of human society entirely depend;
nor is there any possibility of establishing a good correspondence among
men, where these are neglected ’ .
19 Unsurprisingly, Hayek referred to these
laws two centuries later, in his affi rmation of the existence of a spontaneous
order of the market, and in order to combat the ‘ mirage of social justice ’ .
20
The Public–Private Hierarchy Overturned 193

21 FA Hayek , Law, Legislation and Liberty: A New Statement of the Liberal Principles of
Justice and Political Economy, Volume 1: Rules and Order ( Chicago , University of Chicago
Press , 1973 ) . 22 Hayek, The Mirage of Social Justice (n 20), p 112.

The three laws in question belong to private law: property rights; the freedom
to contract; and contractual liability. If the market order is to be extended
over the whole globe, then private law, which is the expression of these ‘ fundamental
laws of nature ’ , will take precedence over public law. As previously
in the relation between human law and divine law, public law becomes
simply an ‘ organisational law ’ , a necessary evil whose role is to ‘ reinforce ’ ,
and certainly not obstruct, the action of the Invisible Hand of the Market. 21
That is the fate reserved for the law in the global market order.

III. THE PUBLIC – PRIVATE HIERARCHY OVERTURNED

This is the ideology which has carried the day since the 1980s. Economic
and social rights are decried as false rights, and the privatisation of the
institutions of the welfare state tops national and international political
agendas. The utopia of a worldwide legal order which would no longer be
a patchwork of states but rather a great ‘ Open Society ’peopled by clouds
of contracting particles pursuing their private interests, has given rise to a
fi nancial, technological and economic space which disregards national frontiers.
The abolition of barriers to the free circulation of goods and capital,
along with the new information and communication technologies, has
struck hard at the sovereignty of states and crippled their legislative power.
According to Hayek, ‘ the only ties which hold the whole of a Great Society
together are purely economic [ … ] it is the … “ cash-nexus ”which holds the
Great Society together, [and] the great ideal of the unity of mankind in the
last resort depends on the relations between the parts being governed by
the striving for the better satisfaction of their material needs ’ .
22 No longer,
then, should individual interests be subordinated to the general good, but
on the contrary, the state should be transformed into a means of maximising
one ’ s individual utilities. As regards the law, this inversion of the public –
private hierarchy brings with it a movement of privatisation of the power
to make binding legal rules. This movement is a consequence of the way
the public sphere has been squeezed out in favour of the private sector, as a
direct result of awarding contracts for public initiative to private operators.
This trend affects not only the services provided by the social state, but also
sovereign prerogatives such as justice (with the rise in arbitration) or prison
management. In the United States, the most radical proponents of this
approach seek to ‘ starve the beast ’ , a strategy which Grover Norquist, the
fi gurehead of the fi ght against tax, has described in his particularly colourful

style as the goal of ‘ cutting government in half in 25 years, to get it down to
the size where we can drown it in the bathtub ’ .
23 Prior to the emergence of
this powerful political movement, theoretical writings from the most diverse
quarters had already defended the idea of a society in which the unwieldy
and oppressive fi gure of the state had been done away with. 24 The current
neoliberal avatar of the prophecy of the ‘ withering-away of the state ’is true
to the West ’ s eschatological vision of history, of which Marxism is just one
competing version. That is why the collapse of the Soviet Union, while it
clearly demonstrated the inanity of believing in ‘ laws of history ’ , was nevertheless
interpreted as the sign of the universal and lasting triumph of market
forces, that is, again, as an expression of the enduring laws of history, and
even, for the most enthusiastic, as the ‘ end of History ’ .
25
These grandiose visions are of course absent from positive law, which
refl ects, rather, the way governance by numbers has come to pilot whole
countries. Structural adjustment plans or European monetary governance
are the most visible agents of this subjugation. 26 Insofar as EU law identifi es
the general interest of the EU with defence of economic freedoms, it plays a
key role in inverting the public – private hierarchy. Member States of course
have a structural role, but it is a subordinate one. EU law is not founded
on the distinction between public and private, but rather on the distinction
between the economic (the exclusive domain of EU law) and the social (the
concern of Member States only). By defi ning an undertaking as ‘ every entity
engaged in an economic activity, regardless of its legal status and the way
in which it is fi nanced, ’ 27 the Court of Justice transformed the notion of
‘ economic activity ’into a dogmatic category embracing any activity which
can be performed by a private entity, regardless of whether it is operating in
the private or public sector. 28 The opposition which it established between
economic rights (universalisable) and social rights (by nature particular) is
thus entirely ideological. There is no legal bond which is not at once social and
economic. 29 We must therefore take this opposition for what it really is: not
a scientifi c fact but a dogmatic construction which implies marginalising the

role of the state. For instance, the Court of Justice ruled that the solidarity
between the different branches of social security was a permissible exception
to the principles of free competition, but gave the applicability of this exception
a very restrictive interpretation. 30 Similarly, collective agreements were
interpreted as restricting competition between the companies which sign
them, and it is only because they pursue a social policy objective that they
have escaped being branded as a form of illegal economic collusion. 31 The
aptly named Viking ruling is particularly instructive in this respect because
in it the use of fl ags of convenience is analysed as an issue of freedom of
establishment. The application of the law would thus appear to be a function
of calculations of individual utility. 32 As Pierre Rodi è re has noted, ‘ For
the Court, the question is always one of checking whether a restriction of
economic freedoms may be admitted exceptionally. The baseline is always
economic freedoms, as enshrined in EU law, from which one may, if it is
really necessary, grant an exception or an exemption ’ .
33 The same argument
turns up in relation to monopolies by public-service enterprises. This sort of
monopoly is tolerated only insofar as it it necessary to ‘ balance profi table
sectors with less profi table ones, and hence limit the competition between
individual enterprises which operate in economically profi table sectors ’ .
34
Domestic law is similarly affected by this undermining of the public sphere
to the benefi t of the private sector. In fi elds as diverse as arbitration 35 and
collective bargaining, 36 the scope of mandatory rules is increasingly narrow.
It is worth looking closer at the case of collective bargaining because it
directly affects the foundations of the social state. Whereas a contract in
private law cannot prevail over public policy rules, things are less clear-cut
in labour law, where in France there are two sorts of public policy: there are
absolutely overriding public policy rules; and there is ‘ social ’public policy,
which may admit variation by agreement if the conditions agreed are more
favourable to the employee. 37 In the eyes of the highest French administrative
court, the Conseil d ’ Etat, this ‘ social ’public policy is a ‘ general principle
of labour law ’ .

Droit et Soci é t é 6, 177 – 99 , which shows that the neo-corporatist tendencies identifi able in
political science in the 1970s were present also in France (see P Schmitterand G Lehmbuch

employers ’associations to impose on employers provisions not already
contained in laws or regulations, was reintroducing neo-corporatist practices
in a new guise, whereby intermediate groups could gain a quasilegislative
power. 39 From the start, then, this ‘ social ’public policy was a
means of privatising the prerogatives of Parliament. But, initially at least,
it operated exclusively to improve the welfare conditions of the weaker
party to the employment contract. It simply completed the public policy
of France ’ s R é publique sociale, and did not challenge the authority of its
laws. However, increasingly, labour and management have been authorised
to waive measures which protect employees in favour of their own
rules for employment relations. This legal technique has become ever more
widespread since 1981 (when the fi rst exemptions concerning working
time were agreed) up to the law of 14 June 2013 (concerning job security),
which gave substance to a programme drawn up by employers ’organisations
already in the late 1970s. This programme was called the ‘ contrat
collectif d ’ entreprise’( ‘ collective company contract ’ ) and involved
the company ’ s right to abandon its legal obligations — except for a few
esssential public policy rules — and set itself up as an autonomous legal
order governed only by the rules of private law. The Barth é l é my-Cette
Report produced by the French Council for Economic Analysis recently
unearthed this idea in its recommendations for ‘ refounding labour law ’
through collective bargaining, which, it maintained, should no longer be
subordinated to the law or the individual employment contract. 40
The domination of the private over the public is also an indirect result of
New Public Management, which aims to apply private-sector management
methods to the public sector. 41 The idea of subjecting the whole of society
to a single science of organisations, based on criteria of effi ciency alone, is
nothing new, if we recall the tenets of the Bolshevik Revolution. This idea
reappears with the contemporary universe of governance by numbers in
which the law is no longer conceived as a norm transcending the individual ’ s
interests, but as an instrument at the latter ’ s disposal. Once individual will
has been elevated into the necessary and suffi cient condition of the legal
bond, it follows logically that every person should be able to choose the law
which suits him or her best (having the law for oneself) and be able to lay it
down (having oneself as law).

IV. A LAW FOR ONESELF AND ONESELF AS LAW

There are many examples of these two tendencies in law today. The formula
‘ A law for oneself ’aptly describes the increasing number of cases in
which people have the right to choose the law to be applied to them, and
can thus elude the common rule which applies equally to all. Private international
law has proved to be more than hospitable to this development.
With the lifting of trade barriers in the free market economy, the freedom
of contracting parties to choose the law to be applied to them has gained a
new lease of life. The objective criteria for determining the relevant jurisdiction
governing a particular legal operation, and the principle that there are
mandatory rules in force and inexorably applicable in that jurisdiction, have
limited purchase in a world in which economic operators are free to move
their products, production sites and profi ts wheresoever they please. The
old principle of the autonomy of the will, which international private law
elaborated some 150 years ago, has been resurrected in order to justify an
international market of legal rules on which different national legislations
compete like commercial products for the favour of the punter out to get
the best value for his money. Such legal forum 42 shopping, facilitated by
the removal of trade barriers, allows private persons to choose the public
framework most likely to maximise their individual utilities. 43 The Centros
ruling 44 confi rmed this interpretation of ‘ freedom of establishment ’ , and in
the social fi eld, the Viking45 and Laval rulings confi rmed a company ’ s right
to choose the law deemed best to serve its interests, regardless of where its
operations are located. Flags of convenience have now taken up residence
on dry land, and the pursuit of private interests clearly overrides respect for
public policy rules. Such legal forum shopping is of course incompatible
with a system based on the rule of law, but it has its place in one based on
rule by laws.
46 The maxim ‘ no contract without law ’has been turned on its
head: there is no law without contract, that is, without contracting parties
who agree to apply whatever law they have chosen. Ultimately, the only
law which holds is that of the pursuit of individual interest. In the light of
this trend, one can understand the importance of the theory of the effi cient

breach of contract, promoted by the economic analysis of law: 47 a promise
is binding on the person who makes it only if it is in his interests to keep it,
otherwise he should be free to break it, as long as he compensates the other
contracting party, who had placed his trust in it. This is the logical conclusion
of today ’ s rejection of heteronomy, which strips even the spoken word
of its value as a pledge between people.
The other tendency may be summarised by the maxim: ‘ Oneself as law ’ .
It applies to the cases where a private person obtains the right to act as legislator.
It defi nes a universe in which legal rules fi nd their ultimate source
in the individual will and every individual is deemed — in the words of the
fi lmaker Wim Wenders — to be a ‘ mini-state ’ .
48 Under its infl uence, rules
which appeared beyond question, such as the fact that violating another person
’ s physical integrity is unlawful, have been challenged, as the European
Court of Human Rights ’recent judgments on torture show. In 1997, it had
ruled that ‘ one of the roles which the State is unquestionably entitled to
undertake is to seek to regulate, through the operation of the criminal law,
activities which involve the infl iction of physical harm. This is so whether
the activities in question occur in the course of sexual conduct or otherwise
’ .
49 By 2005, however, it had dismissed this ‘ unquestionable ’principle
in the case of a woman savagely tortured by her husband and by third parties,
to whom the husband had offered the spectacle of his wife ’ s torment
in return for a fee. The ECHR overturned its 1997 ruling in deciding that
‘ the criminal law could not in principle be applied in the case of consensual
sexual practices, which are a matter of individual free will ’ .
50 This conception
of freedom is poles apart from the Greek ideal handed down to us, in
which ‘ Freedom is obedience to the law ’ .
51 To make enjoyment of someone
else ’ s suffering into the source of a right, and moreover a human right which
no national law can override, is a perversion of the anthropological function
of the law. It exalts the omnipotence of the individual will as in Goering ’ s
defi nition of the law as ‘ what it pleases us to dispose ’( was uns gef ä llt). 52
Fran ç ois Ost rightly notes that the Sadeian hero ’ s pleasure stems in part
from the fact that ‘ he substitutes for the common law a law of exception, of
which he alone is the author, thus depriving his victims of the right to seek

society ’ s protection ’ .
53 Instead of channelling human passions and keeping

at bay the darker side of our nature, which lurks within each of us, the law
here serves to give them free rein. The consent of the workers was used in
the nineteenth century to justify inhuman working conditions. And social
law in its entirety was conceived in opposition to the idea that the consent
of the weak could serve as a justifi cation for the domination of the strong.
This position is still fi rmly anchored in our labour law, but it is increasingly
challenged in the name of individual freedoms. 54 Today, it is easier for the
individual employee ’ s consent to be determinant, even if it deprives him or
her of the protection of a law or a collective agreement.
It is noteworthy that none of these perverted uses of the law have lasted
very long. They led to deadly stalemates and the need for new solutions.
This is why dogma was reinvested after the Second World War. Pre-war
scientisms were rejected, and the need to ensure the survival of humankind
once again prevailed through the recognition that the law is not there to
pander to the egoism, violence, greed and madness of human beings, but on
the contrary to channel these and keep their lethal power at bay. We thus
also have historical reasons for doubting that relations between individuals
may be ‘ regulated ’without reference to a heteronomous instance able
to defend the public interest over private ones. The increasing number of
countries in which the state is non-existent, particularly in Africa and the
Middle East, are not exactly models of well-ordered societies: one should be
living in a libertarian paradise, but it can often look like hell on earth. It is
necessary, time and again, to submit the whims of the strong to something
which is binding on everyone and which is even stronger than they are, so
that human society does not degenerate into the law of the jungle.

V. ‘ FEARING NEITHER GOD NOR MAN ’ : THE UNSUSTAINABLE SOCIETY

Any society lacking a heteronomic instance will inevitably collapse into civil
war. One might dream then of a world held together exclusively by love or
by calculations of individual interest. But neither of these produces the solidarity
needed for people to live together in the same society. To mistake this
dream for a possible reality is a recipe for violence. The promise of just such
a world, purged of the heteronomy of the law, originates with Christianity,
and is not found in the other monotheisms. It typifi es a certain philosophy
of history which has taken many different forms and, as Karl L ö with has
shown, has theological roots. 55 As so often with Christianity, the seminal
200 The Withering-Away of the State

56 Epistle to the Galatians, 3:23 – 28 (King James Version). 57 Epistle to the Romans, 7:1. 58 Epistle to the Romans, 13:1.

author here is St Paul. In two famous Epistles, he proclaims the end of the
epoch of the law and the advent of a time of grace, when all people will
commune in the same shared faith. The most radical of these writings is the
Epistle to the Galatians, which was addressed to pious Jews who adhered to
observance of the Law with a capital ‘ L ’ , the Law of Moses which gives the
Jewish people its identity and endurance:

But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which
should afterwards be revealed.

24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we
might be justifi ed by faith.

25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.

27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither
male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. 56

Apart from its evident anachronism, this rousing text anticipates both
globalisation and Simone de Beauvoir. Globalisation: since Christ ’ s message
is addressed to all human beings without distinction, the differentials
of nationality ( ‘ There is neither Jew nor Greek ’ ), and of socio-legal status
( ‘ there is neither bond nor free ’ ) have become irrelevant. And Simone de
Beauvoir ( ‘ One is not born a woman; one becomes one ’ ): since the difference
between man and woman, in the same way as the differences between
nationalities and social ranks, are a legal construction, they are destined to
disappear and make way for the communion of all humankind. Christian
communities are meant to embody this ecumenical idea on earth, although
it will only be realised at the end of time. Until then, the question is: what
relation should Christians have to the law ?Paul replies in a serener tone,
in the Epistle to the Romans. He knows — as he explicitly states — that he is
‘ speak[ing] to them that know the law ’ .
57 He distinguishes between the contingent
law imposed by the authorities of the moment — whom one should
obey, ‘ For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of
God ’ 58— and the highest law, which is binding on Christians. But this law
for Christians is not really a law because Paul mentions it only in order to
announce its dissolution in mutual love:

Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath
fulfi lled the law.

steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any

other commandment, it is briefl y comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself.

10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfi lling of the law. 59

Of the tomes of glosses this Epistle has generated, we shall only mention
Jacob Taubes ’ s trenchant observation: Paul never mentions God ’ s love. His
only commandment is to love one ’ s neighbour.
60 The Epistle to the Romans
thus already adumbrates Christianity ’ s secularisation, its transformation
into a religion of man, as Feuerbach depicted it. 61 Or, to put it more simply:
from the very start, Christianity prophesises the abolition of law in a society
exclusively governed by mutual love; that is, it prophesises an end of
history which will also be the end of the law. This prophecy has had an
immense infl uence on the history of institutions throughout the Christian
world, although it took different forms in the West and the East. While
waiting for the end of days — the eschaton— which was thought to be imminent
but whose arrival was always deferred, Medieval Europe adopted the
Code of Justinian, which, as Pierre Legendre has shown, thus became the
second book, after the Bible. 62 In the sedimentary history of institutions,
the writings of St Paul re-emerged with new interpretations at the beginning
of the Early Modern period, giving rise to Protestantism and its doctrine
of salvation by faith alone. This was the standpoint of the great Protestant
jurist Carbonnier, who ended his Essays on Laws with a postface entitled ‘ Is
every law in itself an evil ? ’ .
63 In it, he says exactly the same thing as St Paul:
‘ For a people of Saints, the law would have no use ’ .
64 Since the law is bound
up with the existence of evil, and laws themselves are a necessary evil, they
will vanish when evil vanishes.
This promise of a world purged of the heteronomy of laws took secular
forms as from the nineteenth century. Fraternity and abundance were no
longer reserved for another world, but were thought to be imminent for this
world, where mastery of the laws of nature would lead to the witheringaway
of the state and of the law. Marx described in the following terms the
‘ higher phase of communist society ’in which work would no longer be a
livelihood but a principal vital need:

after the productive forces have increased with the all-round development of the
individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth fl ow more abundantly — only

then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois law be left behind in its entirety and
society inscribe on its banners: from each according to his ability, to each according
to his needs! 65

In order to hasten the realisation of this prophecy, Lenin set about providing
the ‘ economic basis of the withering-away of the state ’ :

So long as the state exists there is no freedom. When there is freedom, there will be
no state [ … ] The state will be able to wither away completely when society adopts
the rule: ‘ From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs ’ , i.e.,
when people have become so accustomed to observing the fundamental rules of
social intercourse and when their labor has become so productive that they will
voluntarily work according to their ability. [ … ] Each will take freely ‘ according
to his needs. 66

The aim of providing the ‘ economic basis of the withering-away of the state ’
in no way disappeared with the collapse of real communism. The credo
of an arithmetically produced social harmony re-emerged with neoliberal
globalisation and libertarian demands, which are two sides — economic and
cultural — of the same coin. The new prophets again announced the advent
of a world of abundance in which no one will have to suffer a constraint
that is not self-imposed, since all will be self-governing. The difference is
that the Communist prophecy announced the salvation of the wretched of
the earth, whereas neoliberal eschatology rejects any idea of social justice.
As Philippe d ’ Iribarne has shown, the modern promise of emancipation is
not for the weak. On the contrary, it casts into poverty and isolation the
vast numbers of people who do not manage to assert themselves as masters
in this universe of generalised competition. 67 Yet despite the considerable
media resources available to preach the new faith, it is far from certain
that the majority of people will be lastingly converted to this credo. To
have any chance of cementing a human community, the message must be
addressed to all its members, regardless of whether the salvation promised
is for this world or the next. At any rate, that is the lesson we learn from
the history of religions. Buddhism could never have taken root as it did in
the Far East had it not proclaimed the doctrine of mah āy āna, the ‘ Great
Vehicle ’ , which promises awakening to all beings, unlike h īnay āna, the
‘ Smaller Vehicle ’ , which is for a small elite only. 68 On a much smaller scale,

the economic achievements of the Islamic brotherhoods such as the Mourides
in Africa 69 or the Naqshbandi in Turkey, 70 or of the various minority
religions in India, 71 are linked to the strong feeling of solidarity between
their members. Even Protestantism, which Weber considered to be at the
origin of modern capitalism, does not deny anyone the possibility of salvation,
and no one can claim to be excluded from it. By contrast, neoliberalism
inherently excludes any kind of solidarity, in the name of competition
and selection of the fi ttest. And this, not within small communities, but on
a global scale. Unlike the prophecies of St Paul, neoliberalism ’ s message
cannot hope to establish a lasting and shared faith to compensate for the
abolition of the law. It gives us no future, because no society can survive in
lawlessness and without shared dogma. In attacking the heteronomy of the
law, while failing to generate a common conviction that generalised competition
is for the best and that the resulting inequalities are just, neoliberal
and libertarian politics cannot but destroy what we call civil society. This
assertion is based on the concrete historical experience of countries whose
state system has fallen apart or ceased to fulfi l its function of a third party
which safeguards individuals ’identity and the binding force of the pledged
word.

The Return of ‘ Rule by Men ’

Should Iraqi President Saddam Hussein choose not to disarm,
the United States will lead a coalition of the willing to disarm him. 1

I
N THE ABSENCE of a shared, but heteronomous, point of reference,
human relations will inevitably collapse into the binary logic of ‘ friend ’
and ‘ enemy ’ , which Carl Schmitt regarded as the essence of the political. 2
This — unsustainable — situation is precisely what the shrinking of the state
has generated, and with it the re-emergence of other ways of instituting society
from the rubble of the reign of the law. In Europe, what has reappeared
is a particular from of rule by men, namely networks of allegiance.

I. THE BINARY LOGIC OF FRIEND V ENEMY

The works of Carl Schmitt give us some insight into the structural effects
of ‘ exiting from the law ’ . For Schmitt, it is not the law which, in the last
instance, binds together human groups, but the capacity to distinguish
between friend and enemy. In this respect, he is yet another disciple of Saint
Paul, whose Epistles he pored over at length. However, in his secularisation
of St Paul ’ s message, he was ahead of his time, and produced an almost structuralist
defi nition of friendship: political friendship only takes on meaning
and consistency in the face of an enemy who incarnates and actualises an
existential threat. 3 Carl Schmitt was here attacking the pacifi st illusions on
which, in his view, the Weimar Republic and the Society of Nations rested
(and his anti-Semitism, as well as his support for the National Socialists in
his theoretical writings, are beyond doubt). 4 In order to survive, a political

society must therefore be able to name a common enemy. Schmitt defi nes
the enemy as the other, the stranger:

But he is, nevertheless, the other, the stranger; and it is suffi cient for his nature
that he is, in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien,
so that in the extreme case confl icts with him are possible. These confl icts can be
resolved neither by a previously determined general norm nor by the judgement of
a disinterested and therefore neutral third party. 5

More often than not, the other and the stranger are one and the same. In
a normal situation, in which a state ensures social harmony within its own
frontiers, the enemy is situated beyond its borders, and the recognition of
a common enemy is what brings into being the community of friends. This
does not necessarily lead to open confl ict, but supposes its ever-present
possibility. 6 Human beings therefore come together as a political society
only under threat of death, since the hostility between friend and enemy is a
concretely existential question, not one of sympathy or antipathy:

The concepts of friend, enemy and combat thus gain their objective meaning from
their permanent relation to the real possibility of causing the physical death of
another person. War derives from enmity, which is the existential negation of
another being. War is simply the ultimate actualisation of enmity. 7

When the friend / enemy dichotomy is not concentrated at the frontier, but
becomes active within the state, it is no longer the stranger who is the object
of this existential negation, but a group of fellow citizens, identifi ed through
their class, race, religion or opinions. This is when the destabilising threat
of civil war hangs over the society. The outcome will depend on whether the
country ’ s leaders are able to impose their will at this decisive point, either by
reuniting the society in the face of a named external enemy or by offi cially
designating an internal enemy and managing to eliminate it. 8 For Schmitt,
the imposition of the leader ’ s will by force is the foundation of every political
and legal order. 9 This is why Carl Schmitt ’ s thought had such success,
not only with the Nazis, but more generally and more recently, with all those
who think law is nothing but an instrument of power. It is in such ‘ exceptional
circumstances ’ , when the legal order is collapsing or about to collapse
that its true nature is revealed. At that moment all depends, says Schmitt,
on the decisions taken by the person who reaffi rms the state ’ s sovereignty
by placing himself at the limits of the legal order to judge ‘ when it is truly a

case of an extreme emergency, and [of] how it should be eliminated ’ .
10 The

law is therefore not founded on some hypothetical basic norm, but on the
decision taken by someone who manages to impose his will from outside the
body of laws in force. For Schmitt, this is the only realistic theory possible.
It parts company both with the legal positivists, who refuse to acknowledge
this brutal primal scene of the law, and with natural law theorists, who
attempt to occupy this scene in order to impose their idea of a ‘ higher order ’
transcending positive law. 11 When they succeed, says Schmitt, their rule is
absolutely merciless because it claims to speak for all humanity. 12
These critiques of legal positivism and natural law theory are not unconvincing
or irrelevant. 13 But the problem is elsewhere and more serious, in
the fact that Schmitt ’ s legal theory is basically yet another version of social
darwinism. When Schmitt attributes a determinant role to ‘ the capacity to
distinguish friend from enemy, ’ 14 and to the ‘ existential negation ’of the
latter, he is simply positioning himself within a current of thought which
applies the ideas of natural selection to groups rather than individuals. 15
Alfred Wallace introduced this approach in 1864 and, in his footsteps,
Darwin argued that mutual assistance between members of the same group
(sometimes called ‘ biological altruism ’ ), is an advantage in the competition
between groups. Darwin explains that:

when two tribes of primeval man, living in the same country, came into competition,
if (other circumstances being equal) the one tribe included a great number of
courageous, sympathetic and faithful members, who were always ready to warn
each other of danger, to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better
and conquer the other. [ … ] Selfi sh and contentious people will not cohere,
and without coherence nothing can be effected. A tribe rich in the above qualities
would spread and be victorious over other tribes: but in the course of time it
would, judging from all past history, be in its turn overcome by some other tribe
still more highly endowed. Thus the social and moral qualities would tend slowly
to advance and be diffused throughout the world. 16

Wallace ’ s and Darwin ’ s theory sought to bring together biology, law and morals.
But in shifting from the selection of the individual to this bio-sociologism,
they gave a decisive role to war in the selection of the fi ttest groups.
The Binary Logic of Friend v Enemy 207

17 In a speech of 30 January 1942, Hitler declared that: ‘ Wir sind uns dabei im klaren
dar ü ber, da ßder Krieg nur damit enden kann, da ßentweder die arischen V ö lker ausgerottet
werden, oder da ßdas Judentum aus Europa verschwindet. ’(We should be quite clear about the
fact that the war can end only in two ways, either the Aryan peoples will be annihilated or the
Jews of Europe will disappear ’ ). M Domarus , Hitler. Reden und Proklamationen, 1932 – 1945,
Vol 2, 2( Munich, S ü ddeutscher Verlag , 1965 ) 1828 . 18 Schmitt, The Concept of the Political (n 2) 35. 19 ibid, 45ff.

The effects of this move were soon apparent in the First World War,
which was also the fi rst total war aimed at eradicating the enemy ’ s
biological resources, and then in the Second World War, which was conceived
by Hitler as a decisive struggle between the Aryan and the Jewish
races. 17 Like all the intellectuals of his generation, Carl Schmitt was immersed
in this scientistic vision of humanity, and profoundly affected by the First
World War. The cornerstone of his legal theory was the distinction friend /
enemy, and armed struggle, which he described as the ‘ decisive moment par
excellence’ .
18 That is why, among the legal qualifi cations of sovereignty, he
chose jus belli, the right to declare war, rather than, for example, the role of
judge or legislator. 19
The re-emergence of this binary logic of friend / enemy is in fact a symptom
of an of an institutional crisis which rocks the legal fi eld in much the
same way as an earthquake shakes a whole building to its foundations: it
is an acid test of the structure ’ s solidity. We are probably living through a
crisis of this sort due to globalisation and loss of sovereignty in Europe in
the face of ‘ market forces ’and competition from emerging countries. No
sudden collapse, but strong tremors whose recurrence is enough to weaken
our societies ’legal frameworks. With the inversion of the hierarchy between
the common good and particular interests, the free circulation of goods
and capital becomes a means whereby the more powerful can fl out the law
binding on all. The result is a fracturing of the political community. The
distinction between friend and enemy begins to take shape within nations,
and across the political spectrum, with political leaders frantically looking
round for an internal enemy against whom they can mobilise the maximum
number of people, in order to preserve or take power. This internal
enemy is always an ‘ other ’ , whether this is a Muslim (confl ated with an
Islamist), an immigrant (fi guring as a welfare scrounger), or a member of the
‘ Cathosphere ’(a blinkered obscurantist). And as the awareness of a common
law recedes, so public discussion is replaced by a slanging match, and
reasoned debate is replaced by tactics of disqualifi cation of the opponent.
The crisis we are living through today is thus, arguably, as much institutional
as it is economic.
The criterion friend / enemy has an undeniable heuristic value, since
it helps us identify and interpret the symptoms of the crisis of legitimacy
affecting the law. However, it tells us nothing about how this legitimacy

was constructed. Schmitt ’ s phrase, ‘ there must be an established order for
the legal order to have meaning ’ ,
20 dodges the issue, which is perhaps best
summarised in the humourist Pierre Dac ’ s remark that ‘ Order established
by force is often of the lowest order ’ .
21 For the problem is not whether
decisiveness and the use of force can help establish a legal system: no doubt
about it! Rather, what needs to be understood are the conditions under
which ‘ strength transforms into right and obedience into duty ’ .
22 Neither
willpower, nor decisiveness nor force nor friendship nor love can alone set
up a sustainable legal order. The permanent state of exception of the Nazi
regime lasted 12 and not 1,000 years, despite the promises of the F ü hrer.
A legal order requires more than restoring order, in the military or policing
sense. Setting up a legal order — in the strong sense of establishing a lasting
state— implies instituting a society, and one which can endure from generation
to generation. This process has a subjective dimension, because every
government needs its citizens to accredit it with serving their best interests. 23
It is a question of belief, of dogma, of accepting a legal truth as valid for all.
But this belief is not a private affair; it is a claim enforceable by each and
every citizen, and guaranteed by a third. The stronger the population ’ s belief
in the justice of the order established, the less the regime needs to use force
to keep power.
This subjective dimension of instituting society is nothing new. Tocqueville
observed that ‘ without such common belief no society can prosper;
say, rather, no society can exist ’ .
24 Nearer to us, Cornelius Castoriadis and
Pierre Legendre drew attention to this aspect, bringing to it the additional
insights of psychoanalysis. Peace can only reign in society if interdiction is
internalised, fi rst and foremost the foundational interdiction of murder. In
secular societies, it is the role of the law to embody concretely the logic of
interdiction, so that human beings can together form societies. The anthropological
function, and structural necessity, of interdiction for the survival
of the species gives no indication as to the actual prohibitions which any
given society should observe. 25 This approach is thus entirely different from
that of natural law, which believes that the laws of nature can be discovered
rationally and that they should be imposed universally, for example Hume ’ s
‘ three fundamental laws ’of nature. Grasping the anthropological function

of law can help us understand periods of legal crisis, in which there is a loss
of faith in institutions.
In the aftermath of the two World Wars, a number of attempts were made
to establish a new international order based on the rule of law. Organisations
were commissioned to develop common rules for cultural, economic,
monetary and welfare issues, in order to lay the legal foundations for a
just and lasting peace. These projects were gradually abandoned, however,
after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, and the
shift to freely fl oating exchange rates. This is when governance by numbers
took hold, making the market into the sole arbiter of the value of money, of
nature and of work, on a global scale. This ‘ liquidation ’of monetary, natural
and human resources has led not only to fi nancial, ecological and social
catastrophes, but it has also fanned the fl ames of fundamentalisms and of
violence. Only fervent neoliberals are blind to the scale of these disasters
and their causes. Neither the collapse of the fi nancial markets in 2008, nor
the failed goals of ‘ tradeable pollution rights ’ , nor the increase in ecological
hazards, nor mass pauperisation, nor the multiplication of civil wars seem
capable of waking them from their dogmatic slumber. 26
Yet the effects of breaking up the legal frameworks of social justice are
so well known that we hardly need to dwell on them again: a giddying rise
in inequalities; widespread casualisation of labour; mass unemployment,
affecting particularly the young in many countries; new threats to mental
health at work — and the list goes on. In 2008, the ILO summarised the
effects of globalisation on working conditions, as part of its annual World
of Work Report. In its preface, the then Director-General, Juan Somavia,
outlined the conclusions of the study, which is one of the few precise and
well-documented analyses of the taboo subject of the social effects of freemarket
policies:

A comprehensive overview of key factors underlying income inequalities shows
that these have risen more than can be justifi ed by economic analysis and that
they entail major social and economic costs. What emerges is an evidence-based
critique of the way fi nancial globalization has occurred so far.

The fi ndings assembled here provide analytical support to the ILO ’ s view that the
growth model that led to the fi nancial crisis is not sustainable. It confi rms that a
rebalancing between economic, social and environmental goals is vital both to
recovery and also to shaping a fair globalization. 27

Since the fi nancial crisis of 2008, the effects of globalisation have not diminished,
but intensifi ed. Almost half of the world ’ s wealth is now held by only
one per cent of its population; seven out of 10 people live in countries where
economic inequality has increased in the last 30 years; the one per cent of
richest people have seen their income increase between 1980 and 2012, in
24 out of the 26 countries surveyed; the one per cent of richest people in
the USA captured 95 per cent of the growth following the fi nancial crisis
of 2008, that is, since 2009, whereas the 90 per cent of poorest people got
poorer. 28 These soaring income inequalities go together with the disintegration
of employment protection. At the top of the scale, a small number of
high-level managers obtain both job security and a share of the profi ts, while
at the bottom of the scale casualised labour, and what is called the ‘ informal ’
sector, represent 51 per cent of the workforce in Brazil, and 85 per cent in
India. 29 In France, the last ‘ Working Conditions ’survey (2005) showed that
27 per cent of the working population were in unstable employment, and of
these, 17 per cent were in precarious work, and 10 per cent in employment
which was likely to disappear.
To this astronomical rise in inequalities, and increasingly precarious living
conditions, should be added the multiplication of wars and violence.
The media invariably attribute these to religious or particularist factors,
whereas the deeper causes can be found in the fact that, as the ILO Constitution
states, ‘ lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon social
justice ’ . Even the IMF ’ s economists have acknowledged, in a recent report,
that increased inequality has negative effects on economic prosperity. 30 The
correlation between lack of social justice and violence applies to the Arab
uprisings, as Gilbert Achcar has shown, 31 but equally to the disintegration
of the social bond in the poorest districts of Western cities. Throughout the
world, mass unemployment and poverty are the seedbed of dislocated family
structures, delinquency and religious or identity-based ‘ struggles for
recognition ’ .
The loss of trust in the fi gure of the third, its discredit, is what has caused
the binary confrontation of friend and enemy to reappear. With no common
referent to ensure a place for each recognised by all, society risks breaking
up into antagonistic groups. However, contrary to what Carl Schmitt

32 This notion of ‘ coalition of the willing ’ , coined by the then United States Defence Secretary
Colin Powell in 2001, was described by the US President George W Bush in the preamble
to the Security Strategy of the United States of America, September 2002 ( http://www.state.
gov/documents/organization/63562.pdf ). It later became the rallying cry of the 49 countries
which supported the American invasion of Iraq. 33 M Bloch , Feudal Society [1939], 2 vols ( Chicago , Chicago University Press , 1961 ) .

argues, this sort of crisis does not necessarily issue in the declaration of a
state of exception. The collapse of one legal structure can lead to the reactivation
of another, which had existed before it and returns in new forms.

II. TIES OF ALLEGIANCE

A striking change took place around the beginning of the twenty-fi rst
century in the way the United States sought to refashion the world order.
As the only imperial power for a time, it chose to neglect international
organisations in favour of ad hoc groupings, which assembled as many
countries as were willing to rally round a particular enterprise. In 2003, for
instance, the invasion of Iraq, in contempt of international law, took the
form of a ‘ coalition of the willing ’ .
32 The countries of the ‘ New Europe ’ ,
which in the meantime had aligned themselves with the US in becoming
die-hard neoliberals, were eager to join its ranks. This war, then, effectively
resuscitated the feudal stipulation that vassals come to the monarch ’ s aid
to assist him in his military campaigns, bringing all their equipment, and a
number of men proportional to their rank and quality. 33 President Bush ’ s
coalition was thus swelled by 7,100 British, 700 Poles, 97 Czechs and 29
Ukrainians. This type of coalition would shortly become the standard way
of treating international crises, in fl agrant violation of United Nations rules.
A similar turning point occurred in the fi eld of international trade rules.
The World Trade Organisation, the last major post-war global organisation
to be set up, was commissioned in 1994 to come up with a multilateral
framework for the application of its general rules on tarifs and trade. It was
already equipped with a dispute settlement mechanism. Although it achieved
a lot, it failed to extend free trade regulation agreements multilaterally, particularly
in the service sector and in agriculture. Concurrently, bilateral free
trade agreements were fl ourishing. These favour larger trading blocks such
as the US or the EU, which can dictate their conditions to smaller countries
and demand their allegiance, in return for opening up their large markets to
them. The two sides are obviously much more equally matched in the case
of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (the TIPP), which is
under negotiation at present between the European Commission and the
United States. But the fears are the same: that the Treaty will legally seal
Europe ’ s infeudalisation to American norms in the fi elds of work and welfare,
tax and the environment.
212 The Return of ‘Rule by Men’

34 See above, ch 3 , p 58ff. 35 See above, ch 6 , p 103ff. 36 cf on this point, Chevrier, ‘ Remarques ’( ch 10fn 3) 16ff. 37 See above, ch 3 , p 53ff.

This abandonment of international organisations in favour of coalitions,
and concomitantly the decline in international rules in favour of unequal
treaties are the symptom of a more general transformation of modes of
government. There are not an infi nite variety of types of legal structure,
even if each one has hundreds of different versions. Schematically, following
a distinction found in Chinese political philosophy, one can distinguish
‘ government by laws ’from ‘ government by men ’ .
34 In a system of
government by laws, the condition of freedom for each member of the society
is that all should be subject to general and abstract laws. This is a structure
which rests on the institution of a third which secures the legal order
and transcends the will and interests of individuals. The third enables the
two legal planes which the opening of the Digest so carefully distinguishes
to be articulated: the rules which cannot be the object of a calculation of
individual interest, which belong to the realm of deliberation and the law;
and the rules which fall within the realm of calculations of individual interest
and therefore within that of negotiation and the contract. 35 Their articulation
is what allows men and things to be treated as abstract, exchangeable,
entities in a contract, whose value can be determined by a shared monetary
standard. Their qualitative differences, meanwhile, are protected by the law,
as the domain of the incalculable. In a system of government by men, by
contrast, each person is placed within a network of relations of dependence.
The key idea is not that all should be subject to the same abstract law, but
that each person should behave according to his or her place in the network.
Each must serve the interests of those on whom he depends, and be able to
count on the loyalty of those who depend on him. Legal subjects, in their
mutual relations as well as in their relations to things, are consequently
defi ned in terms of ties of allegiance, not in terms of subjection to the same
impersonal law. The fi gure of the third does not disappear altogether in
these forms of government, but functions as a guarantor of personal ties,
not of impersonal law. This mode of government can do without the fi gure
of the sovereign state. No third instance lays claim to the domain of the
incalculable, necessarily merges with that of the calculable, breaking down
the distinctions between public and private. 36
Several forms of government by men have existed historically. There
is ritualism, which we mentioned briefl y earlier, 37 and also feudalism,
which played a much greater role in European history. Few political systems
have really managed to fuse government by laws and government by
men in the way Imperial China did (which perhaps explains in part the
Empire ’ s exceptional longevity). More frequently, one of the models has

predominated, but elements of the other are always also present. When the
power of one falters, the other makes a comeback, since it has never completely
disappeared from institutional memory. We can see this in twelfth to
thirteenth-century Europe, when the decline of feudalism and its mode of
government by men was contemporaneous with the rise of sovereign states
founded on the reign of the law. We have reason to believe that the period
introduced by this change is now coming to an end. With today ’ s crisis in
the legal order, and the blind alley of governance by numbers, government
by men has resurfaced in novel forms. Thus contemporary China attempts
to circumvent the need for a genuine rule of law by reactivating Confucian
ideals of social harmony. 38 In Europe, as government by law recedes, so
feudal legal structures resurface. This is because, where security is no longer
assured by a law which applies equally to all, people take refuge in ties of
allegiance which they forge with others. Ties of allegiance give access to
protection from those more powerful than oneself, and to the support of
those weaker than oneself, whom in turn one protects. These bonds emerge
in real life before they appear in law. They have taken root in the most disparate
areas, for example, in drug-dealing networks, civil war zones, but
also political parties; 39 in the relations between the political world and the
world of fi nance, 40 and between subisdiaries or sub-contracted companies
and their principals. In its sabotage of the heteronomy of the law, governance
by numbers does not bring about the reign of unfettered individual
autonomy, but rather promotes networks of allegiance which erode the distinction
between private and public interests. This outcome is nothing if
not ironic, in the light of the goal sought: the quest for the most impersonal
guarantees of power (numbers) has ultimately caused a mode of government
to reappear and take centre stage that is based on ties of allegiance.
When these networks of allegiance permeate the whole of society, we can
say, as several authors have argued, that the legal structures of feudalism
have made a comeback. 41 Rather than signalling a return to the Middle Ages,

however, this phenomenon suggests that the structures against which, and
on the rubble of which, the nation state was fi rst erected, have re-emerged.
For bygone dogmatic categories do not fi t neatly into a linear history, but
fl ow into a subterranean reserve from which they can always resurface and
produce new normative effects. 42
Feudal structures have tended to be revived whenever central authority
loses its grip. Each time the form they take is different. 43 For example,
Chinese and Japanese feudalism have little in common with the feudalism
of the Medieval West. 44 Yet common ground exists between feudalism and
ritualism, namely the importance of the personal tie. After the fall of the
Roman Empire, one of the unique features of the Western feudalism which
rose from its ruins was the legal character given to these ties of dependence.
45 The most fundamental bond, and the backbone of the social order,
was vassalage, that is, a contract of a very particular sort, combining a personal
element with a real element. 46 The personal element consisted in one
person being made dependent on another. The form this took varied with
the status of the parties concerned, and could be homage or serfdom. The
real element resided in granting a possession to the dependent party, who
in return fulfi lled certain obligations towards the grantor. Again, the conditions
varied with the status of the parties, and land could be held in noble
(fi ef) or non-noble tenure. This type of relation provides a useful approach
to changes in contemporary law, where we see emerging new techniques of
infeudalisation of people and tenure of things.

particles was fi rst championed by cybernetics in the post-war years, and
later by postmodern philosophy and the Law and Economics doctrine.
Today, participatory management puts these techniques into practice, in the
way it subjects people to fulfi ling objectives rather than observing rules. 48
Governance by numbers thrives on the structure of the network, for which
authors have proposed biological or computing models. 49 However, its legal
character becomes clear when we recall that feudalism was essentially a
world of networks, and when we examine the feudal legal categories handed
down to us. The feudal relationship, as it reappears today, is signalled by
a double displacement: from sovereign to suzerain and from law to bond.
The shift from sovereign to suzerain power is the most visible sign of
the extension of vassalage in Europe today. The suzerain has immediate
authority over his vassals, but not over his vassals ’vassals, whereas the
sovereign ’ s power is supreme, self-positing and bears its cause within itself.
This power can be exercised directly over all the sovereign ’ s subjects, which
is why, as from the end of the Middle Ages, sovereignty became the cornerstone
of the modern theory of the state. However, it can no longer account
for the changes occurring today, since the state increasingly appears as a
suzerain rather than a sovereign power. The European Union provides the
best illustration of this revival of relations of suzerainty today. European
political institutions are clearly not sovereign, a fact offi cially clarifi ed by
the Maastricht Treaty ’ s ‘ principle of subsidiarity ’ .
50 The EU has no army,
no real government, and a tiny number of civil servants compared to the
populations under its rule. It does not raise taxes and most of the rules it
issues (through Directives) are applied in the national legislation of Member
States only after being fi ltered through the transposition procedures.
When Jacques Delors was President of the European Commission, he even
called the EU ‘ an unidentifi ed political object ’ .
51 But if one starts thinking
of European institutions in terms of suzerainty rather than sovereignty,
everything becomes clear. The EU ’ s power over the populations it governs
is only indirect, and requires the mediation of the states which agree to be
its vassals. Member States are consequently beholden to a legal entity which
does not itself have the full panoply of attributes of sovereignty over its

justice and political economy, Vol 3 The Political Order of a Free People ( Chicago , University
of Chicago Press , 1978 ) .

citizens. In other words, Member States are vassals of an entity which has
only the diminished power of a suzerain.
The EU’s structure of suzerainty can be found in certain international
economic organisations like the IMF, which can only wield effective power
over states if the latter agree to lose a portion of their sovereignty by pledging
to carry out the reforms they are prescribed. 52 The acceptance of these
programmes is not strictly contractual, but involves precisely an act of allegiance,
confi rmed by a letter addressed by the country concerned to the IMF.
These letters, and the associated documents, are published on the IMF ’ s
web site. They all look more or less the same. 53 For example, the letter from
the government of Mali to the IMF dated 2 December 2013 certifi es that
the country has made progress in implementing the policies recommended,
and has ‘ achieved the [applicable] indicators ’ . It presents the economic and
fi nancial policies it intends to introduce in the ensuing three years, with a
view to maintaining macroeconomic balance, improving budget management
and encouraging the private sector, particularly the fi nancial sector.
Lastly, it requests a sum of 46 million dollars as extended credit facility.
54 Whereas these international organisations appear to be dealing with
‘ economic governance ’alone, they are clearly using techniques of vassalage
which are ultimately incompatible with the sovereignty of the countries
concerned.
This trend grew rapidly after the collapse of the fi nancial markets in
2008. Central banks and countries threw untold sums at the banks to bail
them out and to limit the social and economic effects of their greed and
ineptitude, thus managing to convert a mountain of private debt into a bottomless
pit of public debts. And no sooner had they done this and footed the
bill for the fi nancial sector ’ s meltdown, then they were enjoined, precisely in
the name of the debts thus contracted, to privatise whatever was left of their
public services and to entirely deregulate their labour markets. And — why
do things by halves ? — the political leaders initially chosen to carry out these
policies often came from the banking world which had sparked the crisis in
the fi rst place. As the ‘ Greek crisis ’perfectly illustrates, there is much more
at stake here than the familiar practice of privatising profi ts and having
taxpayers bear the losses. What we are witnessing, rather, is an undisguised
challenge to a people ’ s right to govern themselves. Friedrich Hayek ’ s battle

puts the question of the distribution of wealth beyond the reach of the ballot
box, is close to becoming a reality in Europe today.
The shift from law to tie would be an apt defi nition of the plethora of
recent contracts which not only oblige someone to give, do, or refrain from
doing something specifi c, but which additionally create between the parties
a bond obliging one party to behave according to the expectations of
the other. This is the type of contract generally used to establish a bond of
economic dependence between one (natural or legal) person and another.
These contracts, which integrate one person into another ’ s economic activity,
affect the status of the two parties after the fact, and oblige them to create
relatively stable ties. Examples are relational contracts, studied by Ian
R MacNeil for the United States, where they are used increasingly. 56 Life
time contracts also belong to this category, for instance employment contracts,
tenancy agreements and real-estate loans, on which a group of
researchers headed by Luca Nodler and Udo Reifner have recently carried
out important research. 57
Similar techniques are also used in public contracts. The state allows private
and public bodies to defi ne how they will meet the objectives it sets
and, rather than regulate their activities, it delegates the task of monitoring
whether these objectives are attained to ad hoc authorities. The state simply
reserves the right to intervene after the fact if failings are observed. 58
We have already mentioned these techniques, which go by the name of the
‘ contractualisation of public policy initiatives ’in domestic law, and which
are used extensively in the relations between central and regional or local
government, and between central government and executive agencies. 59 The
ideal of governance by numbers is implanted here by the use of an abundance
of indicators and quantitative performance assessment procedures. In
legal terms, these are what Michel Laroque has called ‘ techniques of administrative
accountability ’ ,
60 such that public agencies, for example, no longer

act solely in view of the law, but also of the contractual bonds they have
made. The battery of fi gures produced by this mode of governance conceals
a web of relations of vassalage between the state and intermediary bodies
such as regional health agencies 61 or university groupings. 62 These distance
the state from the public and even from the service providers themselves.
These types of contracts are extensively used in EU law for the Union ’ s
economic governance, that is, its fi nality of permanently monitoring states ’
budgetary balance through control mechanisms, themselves inspired
by governance by numbers. 63 However, this cybernetic dream of putting
human affairs on automatic pilot works out quite differently in the real.
The Maastricht criteria have in actual fact almost never been respected by
Eurozone countries, so it is unlikely that the corrective mechanisms foreseen
by the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic
and Monetary Union will be ‘ automatically ’triggered. The net result of these
mechanisms is thus essentially to place countries in a relation of dependence
with respect to the Commission and the European Central Bank, and to
create ties of allegiance to these two non-elected bodies. These ties end up
having more infl uence on the determination of economic and social policy
than the law itself.

IV. FEUDAL RIGHTS IN THINGS

The proliferation of techniques for granting rights in things is the other
symptom of this revival of government by men. In the feudal system, where
wealth was essentially vested in land, men were considered simply as custodians
of worldly goods, which ultimately belonged to God. This idea
still persists in English law, where no subject can technically ‘ own ’land,
even if he or she has exclusive enjoyment of it, because the land belongs to
the sovereign. 64 Thus land was always granted by someone else, and only
exceptionally (the exception being allodial land) were one ’ s rights not tied to
a relation of dependence on another person. Hence the medieval distinction
between the dominium utile of the vassal or tenant, and the lord ’ s dominium
eminens over the land granted in fi ef or on the basis of the peasant ’ s dues or
his serfdom. The granting of land was indissociable from certain personal

bonds between grantor and grantee, which could take the form of acts of
loyalty (owed by the vassal to his suzerain), or of economic contributions
(owed by peasants or villeins to their lord). The same system of concessions
can be found in feudal law for the allocation of public and ecclesiastical
offi ce. The holder received remuneration (or ‘ benefi ce ’ ), in the form of the
revenue from the goods attached to that offi ce. This link between offi cium
and benefi cium was the basis of the venality of offi ces and charges which
lasted until the end of the ancien r é gime, 65 and is still current in some regulated
professions in France such as notaries or taxis. The relations between
people and things thus always preserved the imprint of relations between
people. 66 But, as Louis Dumont has shown, economic ideologies seek to
make relations between people secondary to relations between people and
things because, in the market economy, the goods to be exchanged must be
stripped of any trace of personal bonds. 67 Once again, an analysis of law
can show how feudal structures have re-emerged, in the form of the fragmentation
of ownership and the delegation of public functions.
The dismemberment of ownership is clearly a consequence of the extension
and consecration of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property
implies that one person can have rights over something which is the physical
property of another. The bearer of these rights has prerogatives which vary
from case to case, but they always restrict the otherwise absolute rights of
material ownership.
This is because intellectual property rights are attached to the thing,
regardless of its physical owner. As Mauss noted, intellectual property
brings back into the modern world something we thought was confi ned to
‘ archaic ’societies, namely the ‘ spirit of the thing ’ , which follows it wherever
it goes, and must always return to whoever put it into circulation. 68 This is
precisely what the TRIPS agreement signed in the framework of the WTO
enshrines: freedom of circulation, and the obligation on every custodian
of the thing throughout the world to honour his or her debt to the owner
of the spirit of the thing. 69 What is this structure, if not the revival of the
feudal distinction between dominium utile and dominium eminens?When
rights in the physical object are overlaid by intellectual property rights, the

[ 1944 ] , foreword by J Stiglitz, Ch 6 (Boston, Beacon Press, 2001). 73 The notion of a shared heritage of humanity fi rst appeared in the law of the sea (see the
Montego Bay Convention of 10 December 1982), and later encompassed outer space and heritage
on land. On the revival of the notion of ‘ commons ’ , see B Paranceand J de Saint Victor

latter inevitably end up dominating the former. Thus the US Supreme Court
decided that since intellectual property rights can extend to living organisms,
they encompass the organisms ’reproductive capacities, which automatically
become objects of the patents as well. 70 Farmers who purchase
their seed from Monsanto will thus be infringing this company ’ s intellectual
property rights if, in the following seasons, they plant the seed produced.
Nor do they have the right to buy grain meant for consumption
from another producer, if the producer has signed a similar contract. This
has enslaved crop-growers in unprecedented ways to the power of the seedsupplying
companies. Instead of being independent producers, they have
been transformed into tenant farmers responsible for crops which they do
not fully own, and this for the entire life of the patent — 20 years in this case.
More generally, intellectual property is the basis of an economy founded on
unearned income which extends its dominion not only over individuals but
also over whole states. 71
However, intellectual property is not the only factor in the fragmentation
of ownership. The legal concept of ownership is today incapable of covering
how economic control over certain goods is really held, because the
rights may be spread across several bearers, from private persons to public
authorities. This insuffi ciency comes as no surprise regarding ‘ things ’such
as labour, natural resources and money, which anyway can only be traded
thanks to a fi ction. 72 Since the preservation and renewal of human and natural
resources affect the common good, these fi ctitious commodities can only
enter the market if we limit the rights of those who appropriate them. It is
only because labour law and environmental legislation have set reasonable
limits on the exploitation of these ‘ resources ’that labour and nature may
be treated as though they were commodities. These legal constraints, which
work towards what is now called ‘ sustainable development ’ , show the limited
power of private property rights over these types of resources, which
belong to the dominium eminens of transcendent beings such as the common
heritage of the Nation or of Humanity. 73 The French term patrimoine
(heritage and patrimony) successfully articulates, in the longer term, the

legal categories of persons and things. 74 It now even includes the human
genome, with a view to limiting its exploitation and commercialisation. 75
Developments in tort law have also contributed to this superposition
of different legal relations in the same object. The regime of strict liability
devised in the late nineteenth century to oblige the custodian of a thing to
answer for the damage it caused had the effect of resuscitating the idea of a
thing ’ s guardian who might be distinct from its owner. This transformation
of the exclusive relation between someone and his property is even clearer in
the rules concerning liability for defective products. 76 It is the producer of the
thing — whoever manufactures the product or puts it into circulation — who
is liable for the harm caused by the product ’ s defects, whether or not the producer
is bound by a contract with the injured party. As in the case of intellectual
property, the producer ’ s liability follows the product, thus requiring
procedures of ‘ traceability ’to be set up. 77
However, unlike in the case of intellectual property rights, here it is the
producer ’ s debt and not the author ’ s claim that circulates with the product.
The producer continues to be answerable for the safety of the product, whoever
its temporary owner may be, such that the liability for damage caused
by things splits up into two forms: utile (the guardian ’ s) and eminens (the
producer ’ s, a liability which cannot be eluded).
The formal delegation of functions occurs in both the public and the
private sector, and blurs the distinction between the two. It fi rst came to
prominence in the management of private companies. Under pressure from
the fi nancialisation of the economy, companies divided up their business
into cost and profi t centres, and set them ever more stringent performance
targets. This move towards more autonomous units went hand in hand with
outsourcing the least profi table processes and focusing on what was called a
company ’ s ‘ core business ’ , that is, whatever operation appeared at the time
to be the most competitive in the eyes of the fi nancial markets. The structure

of businesses changed accordingly, in ways familiar to us today: the Fordist
model of an integrated and highly hierarchical organisation gave way to
the model of a network in which the company contracts out an increasing
proportion of the operations needed to manufacture its products. Various
legal techniques accompanied this process. Those used by business groups
involve a company (called the parent company) holding a suffi ciently large
share of the capital of a subsidiary to exert a ‘ dominant infl uence ’ 78 over it.
New contractual techniques are also used, such as concessions or franchises
in distribution networks, 79 sub-contracting contracts in industry, 80 ‘ integration
contracts ’in agriculture, 81 listed suppliers for supermarkets, 82 and so
forth. All these techniques have a similar structure, that of ‘ tenure-service ’
in which a dominant company grants to a tenant (subcontractor, distributor,
supplier, etc) a profi table economic activity, in return for a pledge to
respect certain rules and inspections defi ned by the company. The ‘ tenant ’
can in turn use the services of other companies, for example in a two-tier
sub-contract, which is the equivalent of the feudal vavasour (the vassal ’ s
vassal). 83 The vavasour can in turn engage a third-level sub-contractor. In
order to gain some autonomy with respect to the dominant company, the
sub-contractor can also serve several lords at once. A sub-contractor for car
elements — air-conditioning or electronic components, say — can thus work
for several competing makes. So, as in feudal networks, these commercial
networks are not necessarily pyramidal, or rather the pyramid can sometimes
be standing on its tip. The same vassal can be bound to several lords,
thus creating potential competition, or a confl ict of loyalties, between them.
This was why, in feudal times, the notion of ‘ liege lord ’was introduced,
to avoid confl icts of interest by ensuring that a vassal gives priority to one

lord in particular in the acquittal of his obligations. 84 An almost identical
mechanism today ensures exclusivity in business dealings, 85 as do noncompetition
clauses in labour law. 86 We can thus, without overstatement,

its different operations, and, on the other, outsourced those not considered
integral to its ‘ core business ’ . In the fi rst case, its activities are made into selfcontained
units, on the condition that certain objectives are pursued, and
their attainment measured by quantitative indicators. In the second case,
its activities are privatised on condition that companies accept regulation
by the regulatory authorities designated to ensure the general interest for a
product or a particular service (electricity, highways, telecommunications,
the stock exchange, the railroads, prisons, and so forth). 88 A panoply of feudal
legal mechanisms resurface here in a new guise. The venality of offi ces and
charges, which a century ago Adh é mar Esmein deemed a ‘ monstrous organisation
’ ,
89 has returned with a vengeance, in the name of dismantling the
monopolies enjoyed by public companies. For ‘ services of general economic
interest ’(Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 14 and
Protocol No 26), relations of ‘ tenure-service ’have once again become the
norm. And what the principle of the separation between economic operators
and regulators conceals is the much older distinction between power
( potestas) and authority ( auctoritas) by which the feudal system attempted
to stem absolutist tendencies.
Once again, this does not imply that the world is returning to the Middle
Ages, but only that the legal concepts of feudalism provide excellent tools
for analysing the vast institutional upheavals occurring under the acritical
notion of ‘ globalisation ’today. We are not making a value judgement on
these revolutions, nor defending the thesis of an ‘ eternal return ’ , as though
history never produced any new legal confi gurations. It is as inadequate to
regard the globalised world as a fl attened tabula rasa on which governance
by numbers is rolled out everywhere in the same way, as it is to imagine the
world as a patchwork of unchanging cultures which persist in their being
and do not infl uence each other. After two and a half centuries of colonial
domination and economic and cultural imperialism, there is no civilisation
in the world, be it on Pacifi c Islands or in the Amazon Basin, that has
escaped the infl uence of Western ways of governing human societies. Every
single one of them is today affected by the destruction of the reign of the
law and the instatement of governance by numbers, and all see the increasing
power of networks of allegiance in their institutions. So the return of a
structure does not mean a repetition of the past, but rather the emergence
of new structures which recycle elements of the systems they replace. But we
have not yet depicted this world in the making. And no better vantage point
exists for understanding the government of men than the way they are put
to work.

‘ Genuinely Human Work in Humane
Conditions ’I

From Total Mobilisation to the Crisis
of Fordism

The failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour [ ‘ un r é gime de
travail r é ellement humain’ ] is an obstacle in the way of other nations which desire
to improve the conditions in their own countries.

GOVERNANCE BY NUMBERS was introduced above all as a way
of solving the problems raised by work. The founding fathers of
political economy 1 and sociology 2 were quick to realise that the
division of labour is a nodal point for society as a whole. If we talk of a ‘ slaveowning
’ , ‘ agrarian ’ , ‘ nomadic ’ , ‘ feudal ’or ‘ industrial ’society, we acknowledge
that slavery, agriculture, pastoralism, serfdom and the wage system are
all central to a given society ’ s mode of functioning. It is signifi cant that when
we try to talk about our own times, we tend to talk of ‘ post-industrial ’society:
this is another way of saying how diffi cult we fi nd it to defi ne exactly
what our present regime of work is. Industry has not disappeared, not even
in its most Taylorist incarnations, but it has shifted massively away from
the West. As for the ‘ post- ’ , here as elsewhere (as in ‘ postmodern ’or ‘ posthuman
’ ) the term is a way of placing a question mark over a world still in
its infancy. ‘ Post-industrial ’therefore means that the transformations of the
industrial era pushed our institutions to their critical limits, and we are still
unable to understand and conceptualise the consequences. This is why we
have reason to believe that a legal analysis of the transformations of work
over the last century can shed some light on the nature of the crisis of work
we are experiencing, and possible ways out of it. We shall start with an overview
of how attitudes to work and its organisation have changed, from the

Treaty of Versailles (1919) to the crisis of Fordism. In the following chapter,
we shall examine the structure of the relations of allegiance which have
accompanied the implanting of governance by numbers.

I. THE FORDIST COMPROMISE

In order to understand the employment protection provisions resulting
from what has been called the ‘ Fordist compromise ’ , we must fi rst cast a
look back at the founding event of industrial society: the First World War.
This war contributed two at fi rst sight contradictory things to the history of
labour, but which are actually interdependent: the industrial management
of ‘ human material ’ ; and, as we examine in greater detail below, the appeal
for humane working conditions.
For the purposes of this war, Ernst J ü nger wrote, ‘ States transformed
themselves into gigantic factories, producing armies on the assembly line
that they sent to the battlefi eld both day and night, where an equally
mechanical bloody maw took over the role of consumer. ’ 3 The Taylorist
organisation of industrial labour spilled over from the ultra-modern factory
to take over society as a whole. J ü nger uses the expression ‘ total mobilisation
’to describe this shift. The epoch of ‘ old-style ’wars between European
monarchs, which ended in the nineteenth century, had used only a portion
of the human and material resources of the warring states. The First World
War was the fi rst full-scale experience of ‘ total mobilisation ’ , a process in
which ‘ every life is converted into energy ’ .
4 The image of war as armed
combat, J ü nger continues, ‘ withers away into the much more comprehensive
image of war as a gigantic labour process ’ .
5 In the fi nal phase of this
development, which began with the First World War, ‘ there is no longer
any movement whatsoever — be it that of the homeworker at her sewingmachine
— without at least indirect use for the battlefi eld ’ .
6 The forms of
social organisation introduced during the Great War continued to make
themselves felt on the return to peacetime. ‘ The most important lesson to
be drawn from the War ’ , the American engineer George Babcock declared
to the Society to Promote the Science of Management, ‘ is that the expansion
and elaboration of the principles of industrial organisation, in the form
of Taylor ’ s principles of scientifi c organisation, have proved themselves in
practice under the heaviest burden they have ever had to bear ’ .

applied this remark, which was made for the benefi t of managers, to the
organisation of entire countries:

Despite the spectacle, both grandiose and frightful, of the later ‘ battles of material
’ , in which the human talent for organization celebrated its bloody triumph,
its fullest possibilities have not yet been reached. Even limiting our scope to the
technical side of the process, this can only occur when the image of martial operations
is prescribed for conditions of peace. We can see that in the postwar period,
many countries have tailored new methods of organization to the pattern of total
mobilization. 8

The concept of total mobilisation infl uenced Carl Schmitt ’ s concept of the
Total State and Hannah Arendt ’ s concept of totalitarianism. Its heuristic
value remains powerful, because it exists today in the new form of the Total
Market, 9 in which every existence is converted into a quantifi able resource 10
and the inhabitants of every nation of the world are precipitated into an
unceasing, and pitiless, economic war.
But the First World War had an impact on the regime of work in another,
more frequently cited and acclaimed, way, in that the Treaty of Versailles
provided for the creation of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). 11
The Preamble to the ILO Constitution sets out why this organisation was set
up, adopting for this the terms of the Versailles Treaty:

Whereas universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based upon
social justice;

And whereas conditions of labour exist involving such injustice, hardship and
privation to large numbers of people as to produce unrest so great that the peace
and harmony of the world are imperilled; and an improvement of those conditions
is urgently required; [ … ]

Whereas also the failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labour [ ‘ un
r é gime de travail r é ellement humain ’ ] is an obstacle in the way of other nations
which desire to improve the conditions in their own countries;

The High Contracting Parties, moved by sentiments of justice and humanity as
well as by the desire to secure the permanent peace of the world, [ … ] agree to the
following: [ … ] A permanent organization is hereby established for the promotion
of the objects set forth in the Preamble.

Without social justice we will have war; social justice implies ‘ humane conditions
of labour ’(a ‘ r é gime de travail r é ellement humain’ , in the French);
The Fordist Compromise 229

12 S Weil , On Science, Necessity, &The Love of God, tr R Rees( London , Oxford University
Press , 1968 ) .

these conditions will not exist without a policing of competition worldwide
with a view to safeguarding social justice; an international organisation is
necessary to defi ne and apply labour standards which shall be common to
all nations. This was, in brief, the other lesson drawn from the experience of
the First World War as regards the organisation of work. It proved to be a
lasting one, because the ILO was the only international organisation to survive
the disappearance of the Society of Nations. Its mandate was reaffi rmed
and further defi ned at the end of the Second World War, in the Declaration
of Philadelphia, and it is now preparing to celebrate a meritorious 100 years
of faithful service, in 2019.
So how were these two legacies of the Great War linked ?Is the pursuit of
‘ humane conditions of labour ’compatible with ‘ the scientifi c organisation
of work ’and the total mobilisation of human capital for a global competitive
market ?The answer will depend on the interpretation one gives to these
passages from the Treaty of Versailles, as included in the Preamble to the
ILO Constitution. Both French and English were offi cial languages of the
Treaty, yet they say slightly different things. The French ‘ r é gime de travail
r é ellement humain’means at one and the same time ‘ a genuinely human (or
humane) regime of work ’ , and ‘ a regime of genuinely human (or humane)
work ’ . In English, where this double emphasis is absent, there is simply the
call for ‘ humane conditions of labour ’ . If we follow up what is suggested by
the French wording — expressing the goals of a renewed vision of the organisation
of work (the ‘ regime of work ’ ), and of work itself ( ‘ human work ’ ), in
the aftermath of the First World War — we shall see that the two directions
sketched are the condensed expression of confl ictual and even contradictory
priorities in the thinking about work, which labour law was called upon to
resolve, and which are still with us today.
A ‘ r é gime de travail r é ellement humain’ , understood as a ‘ regime of genuinely
human work ’ , states that the work itself must have a genuinely human
quality to it. We could understand this broadly as meaning that the work
must be such as to enable whoever carries it out to invest in it a part of
him- or herself: that is what makes it human labour, rather than the work
of animals or machines. In human work, the worker seeks to inscribe his or
her mental representations in the universe of things or of symbols. In this
respect, work also educates reason. It confronts our mental images with
the realities of the outside world and thus forces us to get the measure of
both the world and of our representations. Simone Weil expressed this in
one of those striking phrases which light up her writing: ‘ It is through work
that reason grasps the world itself, and gets a grip on imagination ’ s folly ’ .
12
But this interaction exists fully only in what is improperly called ‘ manual
230 ‘Genuinely Human Work in Humane Conditions’ I

13 This is why Simone Weil chooses to end her work on the ‘ duties towards the human
being ’with the assertion that physical work should be the spiritual centre of an orderly society.

labour ’ , which mobilises both body and mind in performing ‘ doing-skills ’ ,
a savoir-faire.
13 Intellectual work also has a physical dimension since it
requires one to be minimally healthy. But it does not pit the body against
the world as does the work of the farmer, the labourer, the sculptor or the
dancer. Proudhon said that ‘ he who has his idea in the hollow of his hand
is often a man of more intelligence, in any case more comprehensive, than
the one who carries it in his head, incapable of expressing it other than by
a formula ’ .
14 The work of those whom Robert Reich calls ‘ manipulators
of symbols ’ 15 mobilises ‘ saying skills ’( un savoir-dire), ‘ writing skills ’( un
savoir- é crire) and ‘ counting skills ’( un savoir-compter) but not ‘ doing skills ’
( un savoir-faire). Intellectual workers are not faced with the realities of their
immediate environment, but this can precisely expose them to losing their
sanity. Cioran has described the work of intellectuals in the following terms:

To be intimate with an idea drives one mad, obliterates one ’ s judgment, and produces
the illusion of omnipotence. In truth, grappling with an idea leaves one
senseless, knocks the spirit off balance; one ’ s pride loses its calm self-assurance
[ … ] The thinker who covers with ink a blank page addressed to noone imagines
that he sits in judgment over the whole world. 16

But the pull of insanity is not reserved for thinkers and ideologues alone.
It also affects fi nancial engineers, whose work places them at the radioactive
core of governance by numbers. As several recent scandals have shown —
in France, the Kerviel affair 17— this type of work ‘ totally impairs people ’ s
judgement and gives them the illusion of omnipotence ’ . It draws them — and
us with them — into speculative loops which can only end in disaster, as the
reality principle reasserts itself. In the Kerviel affair, the Cour de cassation
ruled that the failure of the bank, the Soci é t ég é n é rale, to keep a sharp

enough eye on this securities trader ‘ had contributed to the fraud [committed
by him] and its fi nancial consequences ’ , and it concluded that the trader
had no civil liability for the consequences (despite his being convicted of
criminal offences). 18
So there are two situations in which work loses its humanity: when
thought is banished and when reality is banished. Thought is banished
when human labour is modeled on the machine, however sophisticated it
may be. Taylorism was the fullest expression of this form of dehumanised
labour. It explicitly forbade thought, and work was reduced to a sequence
of timed gestures (others are paid to think, Taylor said). The banishment
of reality is less readily observed. It occurs when the work of manipulating
symbols is severed from any of the experiences which underly them. Metaphorically
speaking, this type of work replaces the territory with the map. 19
It expels the facts in favour of their fantasised representation which, dominated
by scientism and a numbers fetishism, sets reality at one remove, with
the attendant risk of individual and collective madness. This fate does not
only befall fi nancial engineers, but more generally political and economic
leaders, whenever they see the world only through its quantifi ed representations.
These two forms of dehumanised labour are not alternatives. On the
contrary, the twentieth century ’ s insane massacres have shown that the two
are perfectly compatible, when brainwashed masses are marshalled into the
service of delirious leaders. The madness of scientism has the same deadly
potential as religious fanaticism, and today we see them working hand in
hand.
Work can thus be described as inhuman when it reduces the worker to
the condition of an animal or a machine, simply a tool for implementing
the thoughts of others. And it is also inhuman when it cuts the worker off
from any experience of the realities which he or she is dealing with. Between
these two extremes, ‘ genuinely human ’work is irreducibly two-sided. It is
both mastery over the world and submission to the world, creation and
toil. Had the ILO Constitution ’ s ‘ r é gime de travail r é ellement humain’been
interpreted in this strong sense, in the sense of a regime of ‘ genuinely human
work ’ , the nature of the work performed would have had to be addressed.
But it was the weaker interpretation which won out, from the First World
War onwards. Admittedly not without discussion and protest, but, as Bruno
Trentin has shown in his magnifi cent work on the crisis of Fordism, the discordant
voices fell on deaf ears in the political and trade union Left because
the Left was already convinced of the idea of the scientifi c organisation
of labour, and even sought to extend this organisational model to society

as a whole. 20 Lenin thought Taylorism constituted ‘ an immense scientifi c
progress ’ .
21 In his words, ‘ if the masses of working people, in introducing
socialism, prove incapable of adapting their institutions to the way that
large-scale industry should work, then there can be no question of introducing
socialism ’ .
22 Trentin quotes Gramsci, for whom the industrial division
of labour makes the worker feel ‘ the need for the whole world to be like
a single vast factory, organised with the same precision, method and order
that he sees as vital in the factory where he works ’ .
23
In its weaker interpretation, then, it is the ‘ regime of work ’ , its conditions,
which must be humane, not the work itself. Understood in this sense,
the ILO ’ s goal would be to make work humanly bearable, when it is not
intrinsically so. In Norbert Wiener ’ s words, from the subtitle of his book
Cybernetics and society, only ‘ the human use of human beings ’is to be
taken into account. 24 And it is this weak sense which the Treaty of Versailles
must have had in mind when it was drawn up, because, as we have seen,
the English version of ‘ un r é gime de travail r é ellement humain’abandons
the ambiguity of the French and settles for ‘ humane conditions of labour ’ .
Here the human qualities do not apply to the work itself but only to the
conditions under which it is carried out. This more restrictive interpretation
is confi rmed in paragraph 2 of the Preamble, which gives examples of these
conditions. None of them concerns the work as such, but only its price, its
duration, its safety, freedom of association and the right to training. In other
words, at issue are the quantitative terms of salaried employment but not
the qualitative dimension of the work itself.
In Simone Weil ’ s view, this general fascination with the scientifi c organisation
of labour was due to the powerful hold of classical science over
society. From the time of Galileo to the nineteenth century, classical physics
in particular had been accredited with explaining how the world functions,
in terms of mass and energy. The notion of energy was derived from
that of work, understood in its most basic sense of physical force. Work
as dehumanised mechanical energy was precisely the reductive defi nition
Taylorism adopted. 25 The Taylorist factory is but one of the many expressions,
to be found in every fi eld of culture, of this enthrallment to science,
The Fordist Compromise 233

26 S Weil , On Science, Necessity, &The Love of God, tr R Rees( London , Oxford University
Press , 1968 ) .

which encourages one to treat the human being as a machine. The industrial
boom was accompanied in the second half of the nineteenth century
by the development of the social sciences, which fl ourished on claiming to
study human beings in the same way as things. The physical and biological
sciences, industrial techniques, the social sciences and the scientifi c organisation
of labour were all linked, and everything pointed to the idea that
humans themselves could be observed and treated in the same way as things,
and put to use without any thought for the good or the just. Simone Weil
observed that ‘ nothing is more foreign to the good than classical science,
since it takes the most basic work, the work of the slave, as the principle on
which it reconstructs the world; the good is not even mentioned as a contrast,
an opposite term ’ .
26
And so a consensus emerged, in the name of scientifi c progress, concerning
the most effi cient method of working. Discussions could take place on
working hours and on how the rewards for one ’ s labours were to be allocated,
but not on the work itself, which was supposed to obey scientifi c and
technical imperatives. This is what was called the ‘ Fordist compromise ’ ,
after Henry Ford, who decided to share with the factory workers a portion
of the productivity gains achieved through the Taylorist organisation of
their labour. In 1914, Ford introduced a kind of ‘ welfare capitalism ’ — which
proved to be extremely profi table and spread rapidly as a model — when he
doubled the hourly wage to gain the loyalty of his workforce and transform
them into clients for his cars. The overall result was to confi ne the issue of
social justice to the three fi elds mentioned in the Preamble to the Constitution
of the International Labour Organisation, namely the quantitative
terms of the employment contract (salary, working time, social protection);
physical safety at work; and collective freedoms (freedom of association and
collective bargaining). The work ’ s organisation was treated as an entirely
technical issue, a question of effi ciency and not of social justice, beyond the
concerns of a political or a social democracy. The encroachment of technology
on the sphere of justice is a constant in the contemporary history of law.
But once technology has justifi ed the division of labour between those forbidden
to think and those paid to do so, the nature of this division changes.
It is no longer a fundamental injustice which the law must redress, but a
necessary evil which the law must indemnify. As such, the aim of labour law
ceases to be to introduce a just division of labour and ensure that each of
us may experience ‘ genuinely human work ’( un ‘ travail r é ellement humain’ )
but rather to provide compensation for an alienation at work which is
henceforth deemed inevitable for most of us. This is why a ‘ caring ’Left
has sprung up ( ‘ une gauche d ’ accompagnement’ ), making humanly more

27 French Code of Public Health, Art 1110-9: ‘ Every person in ill-health has the right
to receive palliative care and support, if their state requires it ’ . (Code de la Sant épublique,
Art.1110-9: ‘ Toute personne malade dont l ’ é tat le requiert a le droit d’acc é der àdes soins palliatifs
et àun accompagnement’ ). 28 French Labour Code, Art L.5131-3 and R.5131f. cf F Petit , Le droit àl ’ accompagnement
( 2008 ) Droit Social 413 – 23 . As Franck Petit points out, the French term ‘ accompagnement’ ,
which was initially used only in the context of medical or social care, especially end-of-life
care, is now used in French labour law to designate ‘ help ’of all sorts: ‘ Help to Work ’for young
people; assistance for business start-ups; help for accreditation of prior learning, etc. 29 cf T Revet , La force de travail ( É tude juridique) ( Paris , Litec , 1992 ) 727 . 30 cf A Supiot , Critique du droit du travail ( Paris , PUF , 1994 ) .

bearable the sacrifi ces considered unavoidable in the name of technological
and economic progress. Ever since mass unemployment set in, the right to
‘ care and support ’( ‘ le droit àl ’ accompagnement’ ), initially granted to the
terminally ill (as palliative care), 27 has positively invaded labour law. 28
The basic concepts of modern labour law refl ect this restrictive interpretation
of the scope of social justice. The key concept of subordination makes
obedience to orders the essential criterion of the legal defi nition of the
employment contract, and the concept of employment encompasses all the
securities which the law guarantees for this state of subordination: limits on
working hours, minimum wage, hygiene and safety, job security, and social
insurance. To employ someone is etymologically to make them bow to one ’ s
will ( in-plicare), to im-plicate them, and employment denotes the conditions
and limits under which a worker may be made to do this in the execution of
his work. ‘ The right to [obtain] employment ’inscribed in the French Constitution
is the right to receive the means to live decently from working in
subordination to someone else. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(1948) gives a more comprehensive version in its Article 23, ‘ The right to
work ’ . This article is particularly striking because it is the only one, along
with Article 22 on social security, to link explicitly the rights it proclaims to
the notion of human dignity. But this link is construed exclusively in terms
of a ‘ right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his
family an existence worthy of human dignity ’ . In other words, human dignity
is linked to fi nancial remuneration, but the contents of the work itself
seem to fall outside the scope of human rights.
Labour law thus served to reconcile the two in principle irreconcilable
legacies of the First World War: the reifi cation of labour, transformed into
‘ labour power ’which can be bought and sold like units of electricity, 29 and
on the other hand, the obligation for every employment contract to contain
measures shielding the worker from the physical and economic effects of
this reifi cation. 30 In this light, labour law has made the fi ction of labour
as a commodity into something both tolerable and sustainable, and, along
with social security legislation and the public services, it has become one of
the institutional pillars of the labour market. The changing vocabulary in
The Deconstruction of Labour Law 235

31 See above, ch 1, p 25ff.

this domain is instructive. With the consolidation of employment protection
during the post-war boom years, the initial expression ‘ labour market ’gave
way to ‘ employment market ’ . But with the neoliberal turn of the 1980s,
the expression ‘ labour market ’won back fi rst place in political and economic
discourse. The European Commission and international economic
organisations kept harping on about those ‘ vitally necessary labour market
reforms ’ — reforms which would have to be ‘ brave ’ , understandably, since
picking on the weak takes some guts — but this refrain was in fact the code
name for dismantling the labour law inherited from the Fordist era. Its goal
was to inject liquidity into ‘ human capital ’in order to bring about the ‘ total
mobilisation ’of labour power on international competitive markets.

II. THE DECONSTRUCTION OF LABOUR LAW

This attack on the Fordist compromise had two principle causes, as summarised
above. 31 The fi rst was technological. The digital revolution and
the attendant changes in our collective representations transformed our
model of work from mechanical (the clock) to cybernetic (the computer).
Theories of management shifted accordingly from Taylorism to management
by objectives. The second cause was political. The collapse of communism
and the liberalisation of trade in goods and capital resulted in global
competition not only between companies and between workers, but also
between different welfare and tax regimes. These changes undermined the
country-specifi c compromises which had been achieved through welfare and
employment legislation, between the reifi cation of work and the protection
of the worker. And this is why we have ended up with exactly what the
International Labour Organisation sought to avoid: today, the failure of
certain countries to adopt humane conditions of labour has indeed become
a real ‘ obstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the
conditions in their own countries’ . The ILO has been unable to prevent or
even temper this regression, which is encouraged by international economic
and fi nancial institutions and by the European Commission in the name of
these countries ’comparative advantage in maintaining a cheap labour force.
Politically weakened by the disappearance of East – West rivalry, the ILO has
neither carrots nor sticks with which to urge states to ratify its Conventions
and apply its Standards.
The digital revolution and the new governance by numbers which has
accompanied it have totally transformed how work is organised. It is no
longer enough to be obedient, one must be competitive and meet everhigher
targets as well. These are the terms of today ’ s ‘ total mobilisation ’ .

fascisme et taylorisme, n°32/33 (Paris, Editions Recherche, 1978), p 518.

However, this way of governing human beings already existed in a similar
form in totalitarian regimes, as Murard and Zylberman describe in the
case of Nazism: ‘ The only thing which matters is the constant movement
forwards towards objectives which are constantly redefi ned [ … ]. In a State
without laws, obeying to the letter is nothing; the healthy citizen takes his
cue not from orders but from the supposed wishes of the leader ’ .
32 Today,
governance by numbers, with the supposed objectivity of its fi gures, has
simply replaced the supposed wishes of the leader. Contemporary forms of
human resources management no longer require workers to obey mechanically,
like a piston or gears, but to react to signals, in order to meet preprogrammed
objectives.
As a result, work is no longer structured by the division of labour between
managers and subordinates, with the subordinate ’ s work being broken down
into sets of simple and measurable operations. Today, the capacities of all
workers, including managers, must be mobilised. Subordinate and manager
alike must be quick to react and to fulfi l the quantifi ed objectives assigned
to them. The opposition between autonomy and subordination is no longer
decisive in this new conception of work. Whereas the organisation of industrial
labour was predicated on the distinction between independent and
salaried work, and the subordination of those managed to those managing,
post-industrial labour rests on programming everyone. The only differences
are legal and fi nancial: managers get the carrot (bonuses, stock options,
golden handshakes, etc), and the managed get the stick (lack of security in
the job, and of job security per se). Neoliberals had their hearts set on engineering
this break with the Fordist compromise and destroying employment
protection, considered to be an obstacle to the spontaneous order of the
market, and a source of extra costs and rigidities. Their way of achieving
this was principally to introduce competition internationally between workers.
This was made possible by keeping energy and transport costs artifi -
cially low, such as to make relocation to countries with a cheaper workforce
an attractive proposition. Additionally, digital technologies have enabled
the deterritorialisation of any work dealing with signs (not with things).
Trade union reaction has generally been to protect the status quo against
this systematic deconstruction of labour law, a defensive position which can
be explained by the drop in union membership and by management ’ s position
of strength at a time of mass unemployment and the free circulation of
goods and capital. This strategy has led the unions to withdraw into defending
the positions least affected by the rise in unemployment and in insecure
work, namely the public sector or, within the private sector, those in stable
jobs. Although this reaction is understandable, unions thus cut themselves

off from the world of insecure work, particularly from the younger generations,
thereby reinforcing the dualisation of the labour market, and the
social divide, and so intensifying the effects of the attacks on the Fordist
compromise.
Over the last 30 years, employment has thus seen a slow and inexorable
erosion of the protections provided by labour law. This development is particularly
clear within Europe. From the end of the 1970s to the enlargement
of the European Community to ex-communist countries in 2004, the deregulation
of the labour markets championed by Great Britain under Margaret
Thatcher remained a marginal position. Up to the Treaty of Maastricht, her
government managed to block almost all the draft directives in labour law;
and in the Treaty itself, Britain managed to obtain an opt-out from the social
clauses in the Annex. However, as soon as the European Union opened its
doors to the ex-communist countries, Britain ’ s isolation came to an end.
Unlike with the preceding enlargements, this one substantially changed the
existing balances within the Union, and particularly within the Court of
Justice of the European Union (CJEU). As the Bundesverfassungsgericht
noted, the CJEU, which has considerable normative power, does not obey
the democratic principle on which the Union claims to be founded. 33 Its
composition and rules of deliberation discount Member States ’demographic
weight in favour of a one-country-one-seat system. Its earlier case
law had been very cautious around social issues, but after 2007 – 08 it displayed
what were clearly neoliberal sympathies in its famous Laval and
Viking judgement. This jurisprudential turn — the neoliberal deconstruction
of labour law — has proved irreversible, as shown by a judgement delivered
on 15 January 2014 in the Association de m é diation sociale case. 34 At issue
was whether a domestic court can disapply a national provision when it is
contrary to a principle recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights
(today an integral part of the Treaty) and implemented by a Directive.
In the Mangold35 and K ü c ü kdeveci cases relating to the principle of nondiscrimination
on grounds of age, as established by Article 21 of the Charter,
the European Court had ruled that a national court can disapply such a provision.
The question was the same in the Association de m é diation sociale
case, but with one difference: it concerned workers ’rights to information
and consultation, already recognised in Article 27 of the Charter, and implemented
through Directive 2002/14 establishing a general framework for
informing and consulting employees in the Union. However, in this case, the
Court refused to give any normative effect to the provisions of the Charter.

What were the Court ’ s arguments for refusing to give horizontal effect to
workers ’rights to information and consultation, while admitting it for the
principle of non-discrimination ?The Court held that the principle of nondiscrimination
‘ is suffi cient in itself to confer on individuals an individual
right which they may invoke as such ’ .
36 And why should the right to be
informed and consulted in the cases specifi ed by a legal instrument of secondary
law (such as the Directive 2002/14) not also be ‘ an individual right
which they [individuals] may invoke as such ’ ?From a legal standpoint there
is no reason whatsoever for this exclusion, and one could even go further
and say that the right to information and consultation is easier to implement
than the principle of non-discrimination. There is no need to compare
employees in order to know whether any of them have been left out of the
bodies set up to represent them (which was the specifi c issue in this case).
A worker ’ s right to information and consultation, just like the right to form
trade unions, the right to strike and to collective bargaining are not unenforceable
or simply normative claims. They are individual rights exercised
collectively,
37 overriding rights which must be concretised by employers and
which the State must simply protect, as it protects all civil and political rights.
So the Court ’ s decision, just like the Viking and Laval judgements and all
those delivered since then in the same vein, was in no way prescribed by the
texts. It expressed a certain conscious orientation of the Court. What it was
doing was applying the Law and Economics doctrine, according to which
every legal rule must be judged in terms of its economic effects. This is why
the Court squeezes out collective freedoms, while at the same time, and just
as energetically, it enlarges the scope of the principle of non-discrimination.
Collective freedoms being a market force, the Court sees them as potential
obstacles to the exercise of economic freedoms. Fighting discriminations, by
contrast, corresponds to the search for greater liquidity of ‘ human capital ’ .
This is naturally considered positive, since it responds to what Gwenola
Bargain has called ‘ economic actors ’search for anonymity, the freedom to
contract at lower rates ’ .
38 The rights to which the Court gives the greatest
effect are thus those which, like the principle of non-discrimination, facilitate
the liquidity of human capital on the labour markets by obliging individuals to
consider themselves and others as identical and interchangeable contracting
particles, regardless of their sex, age or nationality. An example would be
the prohibition of women ’ s night work, a prohibition considered discriminatory
and therefore made illegal by European legislation, 39 resulting in an

increase across the board of the proportion of workers having to do night
work — increases of 100 per cent for women and 25 per cent for men over
the last 20 years. 40 This type of development is absolutely in line with a logic
of total mobilisation of the labour force, and is diametrically opposed to a
logic of work of human quality in humane conditions, which would seek to
reduce night work for both sexes. And while the CJEU extends such rights
with one hand, with the other it tries to stifl e the exercise of rights which
might hamper the ‘ spontaneous order ’of the labour market, not least the
right to contest this order, a right which can be broken down into elements
such as, precisely, workers ’rights to information and consultation, and the
rights to representation, collective bargaining and strike action.
However, neither defending the status quo nor pulling apart the protections
inherited from the Fordist era are viable long-term solutions. Those for
whom the Fordist compromise signalled a kind of end of history of labour
law forget Marx ’ s account of the inherent instability of modern industry ’ s
modes of organisation. Modern industry ’ s revolutionary character is such
that it ‘ is continually causing changes not only in the technical basis of production,
but also in the functions of the labourer, and in the social combinations
of the labour-process. At the same time, it thereby also revolutionises
the division of labour within the society, and incessantly launches masses
of capital and of workpeople from one branch of production to another ’ .
This process fi nally ‘ destroys all the labourer ’ s guarantees of existence, and
constantly threatens, by taking away the instruments of labour, to snatch
from his hands his means of subsistence ’ .
41 This is why, at the other extreme,
asserting that a labour market has a viable future when it simply discounts
the longer timeframe of human life is to take the fi ction of labour-as-acommodity
as a reality, and to sow the seeds of violence, as the ILO makes
clear in its Constitution. It doesn ’ t take genius to see that the European
Union ’ s abandonment of the goal of social justice and its policy of methodically
dismantling the social state inevitably undermine its political legitimacy
and will ultimately threaten its very existence.

III. TOWARDS A NEW COMPROMISE

In response to the crisis of the social state, we should not be debating whether
to protect or destroy the Fordist legacy, but rather what new compromise
can be reached between entrepreneurial freedoms and worker protection.
This issue has received much attention since the end of the last century, and
the ideas emerging can be put broadly into two camps.

The fi rst goes by the name of fl exicurity, a notion which the European
Commission elaborated in 2007. 42 Inspired by the ‘ Nordic Model ’ ,
43 it has
been endorsed in France by a myriad of reports and expert opinions, all of
which share the same vision of labour law as a variable to be adjusted in the
light of economic policies. The report of the de Virville Commission in 2004,
with its 50-odd proposals for ‘ a more effi cient labour code ’ 44 is an instance
of this. The Cahuc-Kramarz Report 45 was behind the creation in 2005 of
the contrats nouvelle embauche (CNE) and the contrats premi è re embauche
(CPE), which came under such intense political and legal fi re (for their
attacks on labour law) that they brought the Villepin government to its
knees. 46 The Camdessus 47 and Attali 48 reports were effectively echo chambers
for the demands of ‘ international economic organisations ’for a ‘ fl uidifi
cation ’of the labour market that could ‘ dynamise ’growth. 49 And more
recently, three eminent economists decided to endow France with a new
social model, beginning with dismantling the minimum wage. 50 One must
have a very short memory indeed to think that these ideas are anything new.
They were already in circulation in the nineteenth century, to oppose the
prohibition of child labour, and they have been constantly preached over the
last 40 years by the neoliberal zealots who led the world into bankruptcy
in 2008. As Jean-Jacques Dupeyroux remarked, already 20 years back, on
reading one of the countless reports of this sort — Mr Minc ’ s, as it happens,
for whom the culprit already then was the insane generosity of the minimum
wage — ‘ for the last two centuries, the same neurotic obsession of the
well-off: the workers are raking it in ’ .
51 Who can seriously believe that in
order to extricate France from its economic doldrums, all one has to do is
to get rid of the seuils sociaux— whereby the employer ’ s obligations are correlated
to the number of employees in the company — make Sunday a work

day, do away with the minimum wage, ban legal challenges to redundancy,
and other such wonder-working recipes invented to deconstruct labour law ?
And this, without ever evaluating the reforms to introduce corporate governance,
trade liberalisation and the deregulation of the fi nancial markets ?
And without a word on the evident design faults of the Euro system ?Nor on
the responsibility of the French economic elites themselves, who seem — to
put it mildly — to lack something of the industrial culture of their German
counterparts ?Would it not be a more courageous move for political and
economic leaders to reconsider their own responsibilities before abolishing
what meagre protections the weakest in society still have ?
The second approach is to let work, rather than the market, take centre
stage, and to reopen the debate on ‘ genuinely human work in humane
conditions ’(un ‘ r é gime de travail r é ellement humain’ ). This was what the
Boissonnat report, entitled ‘ Work in 20 years ’time ’ , did in 1995. It recommended
laying new foundations for labour law, to include all forms of work
and not only salaried work. 52 This idea found its way into the expert group ’ s
Report for the European Commission, ‘ Au-del àde l ’ emploi’ , published in
France in 1999. 53 The Report ’ s key ideas included the notion of ‘ membership
of the workforce ’ , a status designed to allow people real freedom of
choice throughout their working lives, enabling them to move from one job
situation to another while also achieving work – life balance. The Report
recommended introducing ‘ social drawing rights ’to realise this, modelled
on special leave (training leave, parental leave, etc), so that workers would
have the concrete means to exercise their freedom of choice. This thinking
also helped redefi ne trade union goals in France, which were reformulated
in terms of ‘ social security for working life ’and ‘ securing career tracks ’(the
French trade union confederations CGT and CFDT respectively). 54
One has only to compare, term-for-term, what is implied in these two
approaches to understand how far apart they are. The notion of ‘ fl exicurity
’refers to concepts of fl exibility, economic effi ciency, the market, human
capital and employability. ‘ Membership of the workforce ’rests on those of
freedom, social justice, law, work and capacity.

The fi rst approach is in line with Article 145 of the TFEU (ex-Article 125
TEC), which prompts Member States to work towards ‘ promoting a skilled,
trained and adaptable workforce and labour markets responsive to economic
change ’ . The markets ’supposed needs are primary, and these must be
met by supplying human ‘ resources ’to businesses in real time. The second
approach is in harmony with the Declaration of Philadelphia, which enjoins
states to promote ‘ the employment of workers in the occupations in which
they can have the satisfaction of giving the fullest measure of their skill
and attainments and make their greatest contribution to the common wellbeing
’ ; and with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states
that ‘ Everyone has the right to engage in work and to pursue a freely chosen
or accepted occupation ’ . In the fi rst case, the starting point is the supposed
needs of the market, to which the workforce must be made to adapt; in
the second, the starting point is human creativity, with the goal of constructing
a legal system and an economy through which this may best fi nd
expression. 55
According to Roland Barthes, ‘ History never ensures the pure and simple
triumph of something over its opposite: it unveils, in its making, unimaginable
solutions and unforeseeable syntheses ’ .
56 The history of law confi rms
this idea. The development of labour law since the millennium is the result
of the tension between these two approaches to work. It certainly refl ects
the new state of relations between political and economic forces, which are
highly detrimental to workers due to the distortion between collective freedoms
(which are recognised — where they still exist — only within national
borders) and the freedom of capital and goods to circulate internationally.
Among mainstream political parties, belief in the benefi ts of worldwide
competition has achieved the status of dogma, and a broad consensus has
emerged that the freedom of capital should have an absolute priority over
the freedoms of work. At the opposite extreme from the Declaration of
Philadelphia ’ s recommendations, people are at pains today not to measure
the new international economic order in terms of its effects on social justice.
There is a sort of taboo against doing so, with some rare exceptions
(for example, the Report produced by the International Labour Bureau in
2008). 57 This is why any genuinely reformist commitment has collapsed,
with both Right and Left apparently abandoning any idea of rethinking
social justice. They practise what Bruno Trentin, following Gramsci, calls
‘ transformism ’ , which ‘ identifi es politics with the art of adapting to circumstances
and with the precedence given to the governability of evolving mores

and of society ’ .
58 As such, it is hardly surprising that the present climate

favours taking apart rather than reinforcing what only recently was still
called the European Social Model. The President of the European Central
Bank announced this model ’ s fi nal demise in 2012 without anyone batting
an eyelid. Clearly, the dominant trend is to make national legal systems
compete against each other and to ‘ reform the labour markets ’to increase
their reactivity and their adaptability to the expectations of investors. It
must be said that our politicians have performed quite some feat in making
us forget that the 2008 crisis was caused by the fi nancial markets and not
by the labour markets combined with our countries ’deliriously excessive
welfare provision for employees and the unemployed.
But certain labour law reforms, however embryonic they may be at present,
show that new defi nitions of ‘ human work in humane conditions ’are
being explored, however tentatively. Europe already has the legal bases for
further progress in this direction. The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is
one such instrument — if only the Court of Justice would stop spending its
time taking the teeth out of its social clauses. And there are also the Treaties,
and secondary law. The social objectives assigned to the European Community
and to Member States by Article 117 of the Treaty of Rome have
not been removed from the TFEU, despite some attempts to do so. 59 Article
151 provides that:

The Union and the Member States …shall have as their objectives the promotion
of employment, improved living and working conditions, so as to make possible
their harmonisation while improvement is being maintained, proper social protection,
dialogue between management and labour, the development of human
resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion.

In the Gim é nez case of 1987, the Court judged that these provisions were
purely programmatic, and that ‘ the general guidelines of social policy
defi ned by each Member State [cannot] be subject to review by the Court to
determine whether they are compatible with the social objectives laid down
in article 117 of the Treaty (i.e. art 151 TFEU) ’ .
60 But at the time it still
endorsed the idea that ‘ the fact that the objectives of social policy laid down
in Article 117 are in the nature of a programme does not mean that they
are deprived of any legal effect. They constitute an important aid for the
interpretation of other provisions of the treaty and of secondary community
legislation in the social fi eld. The attainment of those objectives must
nevertheless be the result of a social policy which must be defi ned by the
244 ‘Genuinely Human Work in Humane Conditions’ I

61 ibid §14. 62 Bundesverfassungsgericht ( ch 7fn 64), §258.

competent authorities ’ .
61 The attainment of social objectives thus depends

on political will, which seems precisely to have deserted the European institutions,
not least the Court of Justice, after 2007. But ignoring these objectives
could well end up antagonising certain Member States. The Bundesverfassungsgericht
’ s ruling on the Lisbon Treaty laid the foundations for a constitutional
review of EU infringements of the basic principles of a social state.
The judgement stated that ‘ the Basic Law not only defensively safeguards
social tasks for the German state against supranational demands, but aims
at committing the European public authority to social responsibility in the
spectrum of tasks transferred to it ’ .
62 Even in France, it seems unlikely that
our higher courts would be able to muster such purposiveness. However,
the French Government cannot entirely ignore the French Republic ’ s vocation
of social justice, which is why the ‘ labour market reforms ’of 2013,
which were undertaken to increase fl exibility, actually focused on reducing
job insecurity. So we should be wary of any too one-sided interpretation of
the transformations occurring in labour law, since some changes also point
to new defi nitions of what genuinely human work and humane conditions
could be.

‘ Genuinely Human Work
in Humane Conditions ’II

From Quantifi ed Exchange
to Ties of Allegiance

‘ People not purse are a man ’ s wealth ’ 1

Bamileke proverb

WORK CONTRACTS UNDER the Fordist system represented a
quantifi ed exchange: for a certain quantity of work the employee
received a certain quantity of money. The terms of this exchange —
the number of hours worked and the level of the salary — were negotiated
by collective bargaining. In a country like France, there were statutory
limits set to this negotiation, namely a minimum salary, a maximum working
time, and overtime payments for hours worked in excess of the legally
set limit. Social law — labour law and social security legislation — has made
this fi ction of work as a measurable quantity of time (hence a negotiable
commodity) tolerable and sustainable because it introduces into the work
contract protective measures which make it viable over the worker ’ s whole
life. This covers both the worker ’ s physical and economic security, and his
contractual freedom (via guaranteed collective freedoms). The work itself is
not part of this construct because the employer is the only person to have
the right to organise the time he has bought. This explains the crucial role of
legal subordination in the qualifi cation of the work contract. Work is simply
a quantifi able length of time during which the employee suspends his own
volition and is at the ready to obey the orders he receives from his employer,
or the employer ’ s representative (the worker ’ s manager). This defi nition of
work time is statutory: ‘ Effective working time is the time during which the
employee is at the employer ’ s disposal and complies with his or her orders,
without being able to go freely about his or her own personal business ’ .

3 I borrow this concept from A Berque , Histoire de l ’ habitat id é al. De l ’ Orient vers l ’ Occident
( Paris , É ditions du F é lin , 2010 ) 347ff . Berque attributes this foreclosure to the ‘ ontological
topos of modernity ’ . 4 Cour de cassation, Chambre sociale (Soc) 3 June 2009, No 08-481. Similarly, but rejecting
the qualifi cation of the employees as ‘ artiste interpr è tes’ : Civ 1, 24 April 2013, No 11-19091. 5 They Shoot Horses, Don ’ t They ? Film by Sydney Pollack (1969) from the eponymous
novel by Horace McCoy. 6 See above, ch 7 , p 127ff.

This ‘ foreclosure of work ’ 3 became particularly prominent through a
well-known ruling by the French Cour de cassation in 2009, in which one
of the stars in a TV reality show had his participation requalifi ed as a work
contract. 4 The show, ‘ Temptation Island ’ , sought to ‘ put the feelings of nonmarried
couples to the test ’ , when invited to spend 12 days together on an
exotic island practising leisure activities — diving, horse-riding, water skiing
and sailing — alongside members of the opposite sex, all of them single,
under the watchful eye of a large number of TV cameras. In return for
the sum of 1,500 euros, each participant agreed to ‘ let the public in on his
private life ’ , by allowing the cameras to fi lm ‘ the interpersonal relations
generated naturally when couples and singles live their daily lives together ’ .
There is nothing new about exploiting human misery for entertainment; one
need only think of Sydney Pollack ’ s fi lm They Shoot Horses, Don ’ t They ? 5
in which victims of the 1929 Wall Street crash are recruited into a dance
marathon, lured by the promise of prize money. Television exploits the same
market when it promises fame to young people invited to perform before
millions of people, in games whose rules are always the same — variations
of the Prisoner ’ s Dilemma 6— and basically involve being prepared to do just
about anything to outstrip the others. When some of the contestants wanted
their commitment to the show to be requalifi ed as work contract, the company
replied that participating for free in leisure activities is not work. The
Cour de cassation dismissed this argument on the grounds that the participants
‘ were obliged to obey the rules of the programme, which had been
defi ned unilaterally by the producer, that they were given guidelines on how
to analyse their behaviour, that some of the scenes were rehearsed in order
to bring out their key moments, that the producers set the times at which
they would go to bed and get up, that they were obliged to be permanently
available, and were forbidden to leave the site or communicate with the
external world, and that any infringement of these contractual obligations
could be punished by dismissal from the show ’ . Since the service they provided
consisted in ‘ taking part in obligatory activities and expressing predictable
reactions ’ , the contract between them and the production company
was fi nally qualifi ed as a work contract.
Although the Cour de cassation received fi erce criticism for this ruling, it
is perfectly sound from a legal standpoint. The notion of work, as it appears
in the work contract is ‘ abstract work ’in Marx ’ s sense, that is, work defi ned

not by its use value, but by its exchange value. 7 The essential function of
the work contract — and hence of the labour market — is to convert the
infi nite diversity of human activities, and the particular meaning we give
to each, into commensurable (and hence exchangeable) quantities of time
and money. It was this notion of abstract work that the Cour de cassation
invoked in the ‘ Temptation Island ’case, stating that ‘ what the participants
contributed to the show was due to produce a commodity with an economic
value ’ .
8 If the employees are not at any physical or mental risk from their
activity, it is not for the judge to comment upon its content, its meaning
or its usefulness. These are issues only for the manager, as the relay of the
employer ’ s prerogatives, according to the contract.
What is most interesting about this case is not the court ’ s application of
the criteria qualifying a work contract — on which, as it happens, it cannot
be faulted — but the shift of meaning which management by objectives and
participatory management have brought to the notion of subordination. TV
reality shows are a perfect example of management by objectives and the
fi ction it relies on: not the worker-commodity, but programmed freedom. By
substituting programmes for commands, these new forms of work organisation
give workers a certain amount of autonomy in how they carry out their
tasks. TV reality shows make psychological experimentation on human
beings into a lucrative spectacle, in which the guinea pigs obey the aptly
named ‘ programme rules ’(rather than a manager ’ s orders). They are programmed,
do not act freely, and express, accordingly, ‘ predictable reactions ’ .
This limit case shows that labour law has no diffi culty integrating programmed
activities of this sort, if their performance can be shown to involve
a relation of subordination. However, the work contract is thereafter
modifi ed from within: programming is now included in the notion of ‘ subordination
’(and not simply obedience). Over the last 30 years, we have seen
‘ new forms of subordination ’ ,
9 which blur the limits between freelance and
subordinated work. The evolution of labour law shows a certain autonomy
in subordination, resulting particularly from the employee ’ s right to interrupt
the relation of subordination for reasons of security (the right to leave,
or to refuse to return), and from the right to pursue other activities, whether
remunerated or not (special leave). And, symmetrically, workers who are
freelance encounter situations of dependence in autonomy, resulting particularly
from contracts which integrate their activity into production or
distribution networks. These two movements complement each other, and
transform working relations — whether salaried or freelance — into relations
of allegiance.

10 See above, ch 1, p 26 and ch 8, p 147ff. 11 Belgian law pioneered the ‘ activation ’of the unemployed. See D Dumont , La Responsabilisation
des personnes sans emploi en question ( Brussels , La Charte , 2012 ) 613 . 12 Offi ce for National Statistics, ‘ Analysis of Employee Contracts that do not Guarantee a
Minimum Number of Hours ’ , 30 April 2014, 21.

These trends have amplifi ed in recent years, and so they can be analysed
more fi nely. We shall restrict ourselves to looking at changes in the economy
of the work contract, which has been the foundation of the labour system
since the industrial era. Our legal analysis shows that, as the strictly quantifi
ed exchange which previously characterised the contract declines, so ties
of allegiance between the employer and the employee have become more
visible. This allegiance combines two elements: a personal element whereby
the employee is obliged to be available and responsive to the employer ’ s
expectations at every moment; and a real element, consisting of the rights
attached to the worker to make him or her more autonomous and less
dependent on his present employment.

I. TOTAL MOBILISATION AT WORK

In a work system organised through management by objectives, total mobilisation
requires qualities other than obedience, namely the ability to react
in real time to signals received, in order to meet objectives assigned by a
programme. 10 Under this new regime of work produced by governance by
numbers, workers do not carry out orders in a timeframe agreed in advance,
but must be prepared to respond to the needs of the market as judged by
the employer or, if they are unemployed, by the back-to-work agencies. 11 In
other words, they must be ready to be mobilised at any moment, and must
spring into action when the time comes, in order to realise the objectives
they are assigned.
Availability and response time are the two aspects — passive and active —
of this total mobilisation, which in legal terms takes the form of a certain
indeterminacy in the terms of the contractual exchange.

A. Availability: The Indeterminacy of Working Conditions

One of the most explicit signs of the requirement of constant availability
in this legal regime of allegiance is the ‘ zero-hours contract ’(ZHC). It
has had immense success in the UK recently, totalling 1.4 million contracts
at the beginning of 2014, of which 583,000 were for the person ’ s main
employment. 12 This new type of contract reveals the ambitions of the system
of allegiance: to make the worker totally available, and correlatively

to remain totally vague as to the contents of the work. ZHC is a generic
term for agreements where a worker is at the employer ’ s disposal, with the
employer specifying the number of hours of paid work, and when they are
to be carried out. 13 These contracts derived from new practices, in the context
of drastic reductions in unemployment benefi ts, and they were initially
confi ned to a few industries, primarily the hotel and catering trade, services
to individuals, retailing, and the building trade. The worker ’ s availability
in ZHC should not be confused with being ‘ on call ’ , when the worker must
also be ready to react to the employer ’ s mobilisation orders, because in the
latter case the length of time worked and the amount of pay received will be
known in advance. ZHC should also be distinguished from employment ‘ at
will ’ , which is the rule in American law, and refers to the employer ’ s discretionary
right to terminate a contract whenever he or she wishes.
The boom in ZHCs raises a problem of legal qualifi cation, which can
best be addressed comparatively. Should the workers involved be regarded
as ‘ workers ’or as ‘ employees ’ ?The closest equivalent of this distinction in
French law is that between freelance and salaried workers. This is a rough
equivalent only, however, because the UK does not have codifi ed labour
law; that is, a systematic set of rules applicable to all employees. Every UK
statute has a different scope. Some statutes cover both workers and employees,
others apply only to certain categories of employees. However, the differences
between the two categories of worker are discernable in case law,
where salaried work can be summarised as work carried out: a) personally;
b) under the supervision of the employer or his or her representatives;
and c) within a relationship of mutual obligation. 14 This third parameter is
the vaguest, and it is what caused the problems with the ZHC. The courts
accordingly dealt with litigation on a case-by-case basis. In 2012, the UK
Employment Appeal Tribunal requalifi ed a ZHC into an employment contract
because the regularity of the hours worked in practice testifi ed to the
mutual character of the obligations in the context of a ‘ framework contract ’
(which the judge called a ‘ global or ‘ umbrella ’contract of employment ’ ). 15
The fundamental issue here is whether a ‘ pure ’ZHC — that is, one
which has no minimum guaranteed hours of work — is a contract at all. In
French law, such a contract would be considered void. As the French Civil
Code states, ‘ An obligation is void when it has been contracted subject
250 ‘Genuinely Human Work in Humane Conditions’ II

16 French Civil Code, Art 1174 (Art 1304-2 since 2016). 17 French Civil Code, former Art 1131: ‘ An obligation without cause, or founded on a false
cause, or an illicit cause, can have no effect ’ . The idea of ‘ balance ’replaced that of ‘ cause ’in
2016, as the wording of the new article 1169 suggests: ‘ An onerous contract is a nullity where,
at the moment of its formation, what is agreed in return for the benefi t of the person undertaking
an obligation is illusory or derisory ’[my emphasis]. 18 cf H Collins , The Law of Contracts, 4th edn(Cambridge, Cambridge University Press,
2003) 58ff . 19 Soc 8 October 1987, No 84-41902 and 84-41903, Bull civ V, No 541, 344 ( Raquin and
Trappiez).

to a potestative condition on the part of the party who binds himself ’ .
16

The employer does not commit himself to anything because he will only
provide work for the employee ‘ if he wants to ’ . The employee ’ s obligations,
on the other hand, are real enough (being at the employer ’ s disposal), but
since there is no counterpart, the contract has no ‘ cause ’in the legal sense,
and hence may have no effect. 17 In common law, this sort of contract should
also be void: the contract in common law is defi ned not as a relation of free
wills, but as a bargain which requires an offer, an acceptance and also a consideration,
that is, something in return which has economic value. 18 So the
ZHC is not a real contract; it is a pure bond of allegiance, which transforms
the worker into a resource which can be mobilised at any moment.
In French law, the requirement of availability has not given rise to such
extreme indeterminacy concerning what each party brings to the work relation.
But indeterminacy has nevertheless gained ground in recent years,
partly due to changes, since 1996, in how contracts may be varied. In principle,
for the contracting parties, contracts substitute for the law, and can
only be modifi ed by mutual consent. In the case of the employment contract,
however, this principle must be reconciled with the power which one of
the parties has to control the activities of the other. The contract underlies,
but also restricts this power. So where should the limit pass ?Until 1996,
the guiding thread was the interpretation of the intentions of the parties. If
the employer changed an ‘ essential ’provision, that is, one which had been
decisive in the employee ’ s consent to contract, then this was a ‘ substantial
variation ’to the contract, and required the other party ’ s consent. Already
in 1987, in case law, the employee ’ s consent could not be presumed simply
because the contract continued, and it was the employer ’ s responsibility to
solicit the employee ’ s consent, even at the risk of having to begin dismissal
procedures if the modifi cation was refused. 19 This change refl ected a move
towards greater autonomy for the employee not only when entering into
contract, but also throughout the contract ’ s execution. It implied, essentially,
autonomy in subordination. A further step in the transformation of
subordination was taken in 1996. The Cour de cassation, in order to decide
if a change constituted a variation to the employment contract, replaced
the subjective interpretation of the parties ’intentions with an objective

defi nition of the employer ’ s management prerogatives. 20 The employer
may not vary the contract unilaterally, but he or she can impose changes
in the employee ’ s working conditions, since this is one of his management
prerogatives.
The change involved here is not simply terminological, but affects how
the employment relationship itself is conceived. It has generally been interpreted
as strengthening the individual contract, whose binding force cannot
henceforth be overridden by the employer, even on minor (non-substantial)
points. There is a great deal of truth in this. In 1982, the French
Auroux labour law reforms advanced the idea that employees do not cease
to be citizens on entering the workplace. 21 The reforms sought to ensure
that employees did not lose their status as legal subjects due to the employer
’ s management prerogatives. This was why new rights were admitted,
such as the right to leave dangerous situations or the right to have a direct
voice; and also functional limitations were set on management ’ s powers, as
laid down in the Law of 4 August 1982: ‘ No one may put restrictions on
the rights of persons, and individual and collective freedoms, which are not
justifi ed by the nature of the task to be carried out nor proportionate to
the end pursued ’ .
22 This fi ne principle already suggested that the notion of
subordination was changing. Employees are not simply tools for use by the
employer, but are acknowledged as active subjects, bearers of individual and
collective rights, which should be preserved as far as is possible. But there
was the other side of the coin: the law explicitly recognised the employer ’ s
right to restrict the rights and freedoms of employees to the extent that this
was necessary for the work to be performed effectively.
The new rules for varying a contract pointed in the same direction. They
‘ introduced citizenship into the company ’by preserving the attributes
which the employee had as a contracting party, but they also strengthened
the employer ’ s right to change the employee ’ s working conditions, by giving
it an objective basis, whether or not the clauses were important to the
employee. In the case at the origin of this change, the employee had not
managed to meet the fi nancial objectives prescribed by his employer, so
he was downgraded to his previous post, on a lower salary. The Cour de
cassation decided that the employee ’ s refusal to accept the changes in his
working conditions decided by the employer justifi ed dismissal for gross
misconduct, that is, without advance notice or severance pay. 23 This ruling,

handed down in this context of management by objectives, transformed —
and did not simply weaken — the notion of subordination. Clearly, as soon
as the employee regains all his attributes as a contracting party, he must at
once be mobilised to meet all the objectives defi ned by his employer. And
mobilisation here means accepting in advance all changes in working conditions,
whatever the subjective importance they might have for him. The
employment contract here implies advance acceptance by the employee of
any changes in working conditions decided by the employer. 24
The indeterminacy which results from this is in principle limited by the
intangibility of the obligations which the employer has himself assumed. But
case law brought about changes on this point also, in defi ning ‘ objectively ’
the employer ’ s management prerogatives. This undermines the binding
force of the contract itself, through the introduction of clauses presented as
‘ purely informative ’into the employment contract, which are consequently
not binding on the employer. The case at the origin of these changes concerned
an accountant in a company. 25 Since her contract stated clearly that
her place of work was in a Parisian suburb called Anthony, she refused
to go and work in the company ’ s new premises some 10 miles away, but
more than one hour away by public transport. After being dismissed for
gross misconduct, she appealed, invoking the binding force of her employment
contract. But in vain, because the Cour de cassation decided that ‘ the
mention of the place of work is for information only, unless a clause states
clearly and precisely that the employee will perform his or her work exclusively
in this place ’ .
26 Since then, this case law from 2003 has been confi
rmed through the ‘ objective ’notion of ‘ geographical sector ’of activity, 27
which overrides the indications in the contract. Despite its supposed objectivity,
it appears extremely vague, accommodating — perhaps — the availability
of public transport, 28 but not the distance from the employee ’ s home to
the new place of work, which, although considered ‘ subjective ’ , was taken
into account before the case law changes of 1996. The Cour de cassation
subsequently took a further step towards objectifying the employer ’ s prerogatives
when it stated that

if an employee is occasionally required to work outside the geographical sector
in which he or she usually works, or outside the limits stipulated in a contractual
clause concerning geographical mobility, this may not constitute a variation to

the employment contract [ … ] if this posting is in the interests of the company,
is justifi ed by exceptional circumstances, and if the employee is informed of the
temporary nature of this posting, and its anticipated length, a reasonable amount
of time in advance. 29

Hence the contract must give way before the requirement of mobility or,
more precisely, the solidity of the contractual bond is inversely proportional
to the binding force of its content.

***

This erosion of the binding force of the employment contract is also evident
in the French law of 14 June 2013 ‘ relating to job security ’ .
30 Proposed by
a left-wing government, it was the result of a cross-industry national agreement,
and was meant to arrive at new compromises between fl exibility for
the company and employment security. With this in view, two new types
of company-wide collective agreement were invented, in order to suspend
certain clauses in individual employment contracts. One concerned agreements
on mobility within a company, for companies with no redundancy
plans, but which wanted to be able to count on greater mobility from their
workforce, between posts and geographically. 31 The second type concerned
agreements to maintain employment, and applied to companies suffering
from ‘ serious circumstantial economic diffi culties ’ , which were allowed,
under certain conditions, to envisage lowering salaries. 32 In both cases, any
employees who refused the suspension of the related contractual clauses
would be fi red, a dismissal qualifi ed in the legislation in such a way that it
could not lead to judicial proceedings.
These new agreements not only relativise the binding force of the contract,
they also impose new obligations on the employer, which would previously
have been termed ‘ paternalistic ’ . The employer must henceforth take into
account employees ’family situations, and see to it that they maintain and
improve their skills. 33 Instead of a predictable quantity of time and money,
these contracts promise a lasting personal bond. Of course, the promise
of secure ties is often hollow, whereas the insecurity concerning the hours

worked and the place of work, and even concerning pay, is absolutely real.
Yet a legal analysis shows that this shift from exchanging specifi c services to
infeudalising persons is a deep-seated trend. The agreements on mobility and
on maintaining employment were based largely on older plans called ‘ competitiveness-employment
agreements ’ ,
34 invented under a previous French
government of the opposite political colour, suggesting that these changes to
the work contract are subtended by an implicit political (and not trade union)
consensus, and are not the product of a moment of political hyper-activity.
This is but one sign of a much broader phenomenon, which is the erosion
of the binding force of individual employment contracts with respect to collective
agreements and habitual practice in the company. The French Constitutional
Council decided, without batting an eyelid, that the establishment
of a collective agreement concerning annualising the working hours, ‘ does
not constitute a variation to the employment contract ’ . This measure had
been introduced under a right-wing government and was not repealed when
the Left came to power. 35 Yet it potentially imposed major constraints on
employees, since they can no longer anticipate when they will be working,
and it may also contradict clauses in their employment contracts, and thus
curb contractual freedom, which is recognised as a constitutional freedom.
The Constitutional Council decided that

the law-maker intended to enable employees ’working time to be adapted to the
company ’ s rhythms of production; [ … ] this possibility of organising working time
without having to gain the consent of each individual employee is conditional
upon the prior existence of a collective agreement in the company, which permits
this sort of modifi cation [ … ]; it follows that these provisions, since they are based
on suffi cient grounds of general interest, do not infringe contractual freedom in a
manner contrary to the Constitution. 36

Making employees adaptable to the rhythms of production is thus presented
as justifi able despite infringement of contractual freedom. A similar spirit
imbues Article 145 of the TFEU, which calls for a labour force that can
adapt and react rapidly to the needs of the economy. This position implicitly
derives from the economic analysis of law, and its balancing of law
and effi ciency. The constitutional blessing given to employees ’adaptation
to the rhythms of production rides roughshod over ‘ the general principle
of adapting work to the worker ’ , as a European directive concerning health
and safety at work, and the organisation of working time, clearly states. 37

B. Readiness: The Indeterminacy of Work Operations

New management methods seek to mobilise the intellectual capacities of
workers. Instead of having their work broken down into a set of simple
operations which must be performed in the shortest possible time, workers
are driven by the results to be attained. For employees this change is doubleedged.
On the one hand, they regain a certain mastery over the performance
of their tasks, which can mean a certain freedom in the work, for which they
are answerable. On the other hand, the fi xing of objectives by management
means the obligation to produce set results while being prevented from participating
in the meaning of the work, which can increase workers ’alienation.
On the legal plane, this change in the forms of organisation of work
raises the question of the place of objectives in the work contract: can the
employer decide them unilaterally ?By what method will their achievement
be assessed ?And if they are not met, what conclusions can be drawn ?If
we can answer these three questions, we will be able to shed light on the
nature of the new ties of allegiance which are forming today in the economic
sphere.
Fixing objectives is one of the manager ’ s prerogatives 39— or even a duty,
if the employment contract stipulates that all or part of the worker ’ s pay
will be dependent on achieving these. 40 For the objectives to be enforceable,
they must fulfi l three conditions defi ned in case law: the employee must have
been informed of them; 41 they must be realistic ( ‘ reasonable and compatible
with the market ’ ); 42 and the worker must have the personal and material
means to achieve them (they must have received the required training and
have the required qualifi cations to carry out the tasks). 43
Assessing the attainment of objectives is the corollary of the autonomy
granted the worker to meet them. This is why issues of assessment are

law, as long as the sum can be determined, and it is not lower than the statutory minimum, or
the amount set by collective agreement. 50 French Labour Code, Art. L 1331-2. 51 Soc 2 March 2011, Neopost. This case law establishes that potestative conditions, already
admitted in other types of contract, can be used in contracts under labour law. cf J Rochfeld ,

inseparable from systems of governance by numbers. Michael Power has
shown in a seminal work that evaluation is the new, and far from neutral,
core ritual of what he calls the Audit Society, and one which produces many
nefarious effects in the way organisations function. 44 One such effect is to
introduce new risks to mental health. 45 ‘ Employee evaluation methods and
techniques ’ 46 cover a vast range of tools which the management sciences
have attempted to inventory. 47 The majority are for quantitative assessment,
but some are also qualitative, the most emblematic of these being the
Appraisal Interview, for which the employee is expected to go back over the
tasks he was assigned and refl ect on how he performed them.
The legal force of objectives is limited because in the employment contract
the employee ’ s obligations consist in using certain means and not
obtaining certain outcomes. A decision of the Cour de cassation states
that in general ‘ insuffi cient results cannot in themselves constitute a cause
for dismissal ’ .
48 But this does not mean that the setting of objectives has
no effect on the performance of the contract. Not meeting objectives can,
for example, justify a reduction in salary. 49 If we recall that the amount of
salary paid is the very core of the employer ’ s obligations, and that the sum
cannot be modifi ed even with good disciplinary justifi cations, then we will get
a sense of how deeply management by objectives has affected the economy
of the employment contract. 50 Henceforth, the employer can also lower pay
after unilaterally revising the objectives assigned to the employee. The Cour
de cassation has accepted that this is the employer ’ s right, since ‘ the employment
contract provides that the defi nition of the objectives which condition
the variability of the employee ’ s pay is one of the employer ’ s management
prerogatives. ’ 51 This position goes against the rule that a reduction in salary
cannot be imposed on employees without their consent, a rule which for
some commentators was the pre-eminent sign of the renewed weight given

7 am. The Daimler Group installed an ‘ Absence Assistant ’which removed the mail addressed
to employees during their holidays, and suggested to the sender either that they contact another
person, or that they resend the mail on the person ’ s return. ( Le Figaro, 4 September 2014).

to the binding nature of the individual contract. 52 With this new clause,
however, the employer can lower the pay without having to renegotiate the
contract or start disciplinary proceedings, where using reduction of pay as
a penalty is forbidden.
What conclusions can be drawn from this rather technical overview of
today ’ s total mobilisation of employees, as expressed in law ?First, it shows
that the vocabulary imposed by the Cour de cassation, when it states that
‘ the personal life of the employee ’falls outside the employer ’ s management
prerogatives, is in fact misleading. 53 What falls outside are the choices
made by employees in their private lives, which employers could previously
monitor: employees ’ways of life, family status, religion or way of dressing.
The power over the employee ’ s person has, by contrast, been considerably
reinforced by management by objectives. Salaried employment had always
involved a certain reifi cation of the person, who is both subject and object
of the employment contract. In return for the performance of the work, the
worker received employment protection, which constructed the worker ’ s
professional identity, that is, a relatively stable objective form of recognition.
But today, with management by objectives, there is, paradoxically, a
much greater subjective investment required of the worker. The worker ’ s
(programmed) autonomy, and the destabilisation in time and space of the
performance of the work are major factors here. This trend is reinforced
by the more general demand that the workforce be always at the ready.
This obsession, which in France is shared by both left- and right-wing governments,
is expressed most crudely in their determination to destroy the
Sunday rest. 54 One would think that the very idea of a period of collectively
shared time escaping the grip of the market is anathema to them, while at
the same time the most successful German fi rms are doing just the opposite,
reconstituting ‘ humane conditions of labour ’by deactivating employees ’
work mailboxes during their rest periods. 55 Yet the destructive effects of
Sunday opening or night work — which is also on the increase — on family
life are no secret; simply, the economic indicators used under the regime of
governance by numbers do not take these effects into account. Other signs
of the increasing grip of governance by numbers are the new notions arising
258 ‘Genuinely Human Work in Humane Conditions’ II

56 cf P-F Girard , Manuel é l é mentaire de droit romain ( Paris , Rousseau , 1911 ) 189ff .

in the area of health and safety, such as work intensity and stress at work,
harsh conditions and psycho-social risks. These risks are not only imposed
through orders from above but also from within, through the internalisation
of constraints and risks which, under the Fordist regime, the employer had
shouldered alone.
The legal limits placed on acts of allegiance show that workers are treated
as free and rational beings: they cannot be subjected to restrictions or inspections
without being informed in advance, and they have the right to challenge
those which appear unjustifi ed or disproportionate in the light of the
task to be performed. They are like free men who, having pledged allegiance
to someone, are obliged to do their utmost to be of service to them. As for
employers, they no longer have the right to intrude upon the employee ’ s
private life, but they are obliged to take it into account, for example when
they wish to impose new constraints which may be diffi cult to reconcile with
family life.
Additionally, employers can legitimately set objectives, but only if employees
receive the training and material means necessary to meet these. They
have the right to dismiss staff for economic reasons, but only if they have
done everything possible to keep them on, including changing their conditions
of employment or even reducing their salary. Of course, this picture
of the legal rules applied to employment does not faithfully refl ect actual
practice, but it does enable us to foreground the structure of allegiance, in
which a certain number of new rights are linked to increasing demands for
availability and responsiveness.

II. THE ‘ NEW RIGHTS ’ATTACHED TO THE PERSON

The fi ction of work as a commodity has thus been progressively replaced,
in the employment contract ’ s new economy, with the fi ction of the free
worker. This fi ction is sustained by granting employees new rights, which
are supposed to help them assume their responsibilities throughout their
working lives. Workers ’relative emancipation exposes them to dangers
from which they were previously shielded. To explain this, we must return
to the originary meaning of ‘ emancipation ’in law. In Roman law, emancipation
fi rst appeared as the pater familias’ s punishment of his son, who
was thus deprived of his protection 56— and of his inheritance. This punishment
was less severe than being put to death or sold abroad, but it was
worse than simple disinheritance. Emancipation made the child sui iuris,
that is, it invested him with legal capacity, only if he simultaneously ceased
to exist for his former family, and suffered a series of capitis deminutiones
(reductions in rights). Over time, this regime of emancipation became less

57 ibid, 191 – 92. 58 On this change in the concept of capacity, see S Godelain , La Capacit édans les contrats

Preconditions of a Market Economy ( Oxford/Portland , Hart , 2009 ) 184 . 59 Soc 25 February 1992, Bull civ V, No 122 Expovit.

harsh. For example, the emancipated son could later retain ownership of
his peculium profecticium that is, the goods he had managed to acquire
with the money his father had given him before his emancipation. A frequent
form of emancipation, with remancipatio patri, equated the emancipated
son with a freedman, over whom the father had the prerogatives of
an employer. 57
The status of the emancipated son sheds light on the ambiguous status
of post-Fordist workers. They are, of course, spared the Taylorist straightjacket:
the work is not broken down into a prescribed sequence of gestures,
and there is more autonomy in the way it is carried out. But it is
an autonomy in subordination, which implies less contractual protection
and more responsibility. Freed from Taylorist constraints and with greater
scope of action, workers are also more directly exposed to the constraints
of the market, to which they must try to adapt. In order to accommodate
these new risks, and to ensure that workers are fully mobilisable and reactive,
they obtain protection which is not linked to a particular profession
or company, but rather to their person, throughout their working lives. The
counterpart of the demand for permanent availability is thus the personalisation
of certain rights, which, like the peculium profecticium, are attached
to the person and enforceable against the employer. And indeed, the number
of these employee rights has soared since the beginning of the 2000s. But,
contrary to what one would expect from an increase in effective freedoms,
these rights seem designed to encourage the worker to adapt to the expectations
of the labour market, and to compensate for the loss in employment
and welfare protection. To these new rights correspond new duties for
the employer. The employment contract no longer obliges employers solely
to pay a sum of money, but additionally they must ensure that employees
maintain their work skills. Not simply their physical abilities, but also their
mental capacities and their employability. The duty of care for the person
of the worker, and not only for his physical well-being, had been gradually
excluded from the employment relationship as paternalism waned, and as
social security took over responsibility for the longer period of the employee
’ s life. This duty is making a comeback today, but in new forms. Broadly,
among the new obligations incumbent upon the employer, there are those
he must discharge himself, and those he can pay an organisation outside the
company to fulfi l.
Supporting employees ’capacities belongs to the fi rst category. 58 This
duty was invented by the French Cour de cassation in 1992, 59 and later
260 ‘Genuinely Human Work in Humane Conditions’ II

60 French Labour Code, Art L.6321-1: ‘ Employers must ensure that employees are adapted
to their job positions. They must ensure that employees maintain the capacity to perform their
tasks, particularly in the light of the evolution of their jobs, of technology and of work organisation.
They may suggest training to help boost skills or combat illiteracy ’ . 61 See below, ch 14 , and above, ch 11 , p 211ff. 62 For this notion, see G Lyon-Caen , La Pr é voyance ( Paris , Dalloz , 1994 ), 126 .

became law, containing provisions on the employer ’ s obligation to achieve
certain results (to ensure employees ’adaptation to their jobs), an obligation
of means (ensure that their occupational skills are maintained) and a simple
moral obligation (encourage skills development). 60 The second of these
obligations — monitoring employee skill levels — is particularly important
here because it is emblematic of ties of allegiance. Typically, emphasis shifts
from law to contract to embody the master ’ s duty to attend to the longterm
interests of those who serve him. This is the type of relation pertaining
between contracting companies and their interlocking chain of service
companies. 61

A. Developments in Collective Social Insurance

The other category of duties incumbent upon the employer covers those
he meets through fi nancial contributions to collective funds, managed by
a third party. The funds are private social insurance schemes ( la pr é voyance).
62 It is worth looking at these more closely because they are the site of
an obstinate struggle between two approaches. For one school of thought,
these funds constitute a form of property rights guaranteed by the insurance
market. For the other, these are social rights based on social solidarity. In
order to grasp the importance of this divergence, we must take a brief step
back in time.
In France, from the abolition of the corporations to the creation of the
social security system, social protection was in the hands of private actors.
The initiatives came from the employees themselves, who built up precautionary
savings, or from employers who considered they had a moral debt
to their employees when they were old, ill, incapacitated through a work
accident, or heads of household. These individual initiatives took on a
collective dimension when employers turned to insurance companies to
spread the fi nancial burden between them, and when employees founded
mutual benefi t associations, which played the same role, as regards collective
assistance, as trade confraternities had played under the Ancien r é gime.
These mutual benefi t societies, which were legalised in 1852 and are today
covered by a specifi c legal code, are non-profi t-making bodies managed by
representatives of their members. So already at that time there were two
types of collective protection funds, both of which were private initiatives.
The ‘New Rights’ Attached to the Person 261

63 French Social Security Code, Art L 111-1. 64 cf P Durand , ‘ Des conventions collectives de travail aux conventions collectives de s é curit
ésociale ’( 1960 ) Droit social, 42 . These joint representative bodies ( institutions paritaires)
were called ‘ L4 ’ , referring to the article of the Social Security Code which regulated them at
the time.

One was linked to the insurance market and the other to occupational solidarity
schemes.
When French social security was created in1945, it inherited this tradition
to a certain extent. Unlike its British counterpart, which was a public service
run by the state, French social security involved a mixture of public and
private law. The originality of the French system was its social-democratic
principle, according to which representatives of the interested parties themselves
managed a system which covered the whole population. But this new
scheme also represented a qualitative break with earlier collective endeavours.
It was based on ‘ national solidarity ’ ; 63 it was obligatory (no longer
voluntary); and the rights which it generated were attached to individuals
and accompanied them ‘ from the cradle to the grave ’ . Social security is the
primary agent in protecting career paths, and it is also the main way in
which employers can externalise their social responsibilities. It has become
a required third party to any employment contract, endowing employees
with personal rights which replace their dependence on an employer ’ s paternalism.
Since these rights are necessarily limited, the creation of the social
security system did not do away with the need for what thereafter was called
‘ complementary social protection ’ . The social partners were subsequently
authorised by law to set up non-profi t-making joint representative bodies
by collective agreement, to ensure fair distribution between the contributors
to the fund of the burden of the sums to be paid out to employees or
their benefi ciaries. 64 These institutions operated alongside the mutual benefi
t societies. Profi t-making insurance companies were, however, excluded
from schemes for complementary risk cover. At the time, it was considered
that these complementary schemes should be based entirely on principles of
voluntary solidarity and social democracy. This was the normative matrix
in which complementary retirement pension schemes were set up, in 1947,
then unemployment insurance in 1958, which was again the result of a collective
agreement, and was managed jointly by the social partners. When
these different regimes became obligatory, they began to resemble the social
security system. European law treats them as all the same, even if they are
still managed separately. For the other risks covered by complementary protection
schemes, voluntary solidarity remains the norm.
The ultra-liberal turn and the pressure exerted by European law as from
the 1980s had the effect of integrating private insurance into the complementary
social protection system, and of gradually forcing all the operators
on this gigantic and lucrative ‘ market ’to follow the same rules. Between

‘ Pr é cis ’ 2011 ), 1030ff . 66 cf J Barth é l é my , ‘ Les fondamentaux du droit de la “ PSC ” ’( 2013 ) Droit social, 873ff . 67 This advantage was considerably reduced in 2011 under the presidency of Nicolas
Sarkozy. Today, these contracts are taxed at 7 % , compared to 9 %for normal contracts. They
were criticised in the same year by the European Commission, which regards this provision as
state aid contravening the rules of the European market. 68 French Labour Code, Art 2221-1, which states that the book of the Labour Code devoted
to collective bargaining and collective agreements ‘ defi nes the rules for the exercise, by collective
bargaining, of employees ’rights concerning all their conditions of employment, their
professional training, and their social guarantees’ . 69 French Social Security Code, Art L.911-1ff. 70 Art L 911-2 of the Social Security Code gives an indicative list of these risks.

1985 and 2003, no less than eight laws and ordonnances were passed. 65
The most important of these was the Evin Law of 31 December 1989. Its primary
aim was to bring into force, in the sector of collective protection plans,
the European directives relating to the free provision of services regarding
personal insurance. In the name of ‘ reinforcing the guarantees offered to
people insured ’(the law ’ s title), the joint representative bodies ( institutions
paritaires) and the mutual benefi t societies ( mutuelles) were obliged to have
a certain level of capital corresponding to their commitments. This implied
abandoning the principle of redistribution in order to fl uidify the market
and make the three types of operators — the joint representative bodies, the
insurance companies and the mutuelles— compete. 66 The link established in
1945 between the various dimensions of complementary social protection —
based on collective agreements, non-profi t-making and democratically managed
— was thus broken. As a trade-off, the insurance companies which were
accepted into this market had to obey certain rules inspired by the principle
of solidarity — life-long cover, uniform fees, no individual surcharges — with
a tax break for contracts deemed ‘ in a spirit of solidarity and social responsibility
’ , for healthcare without any selection on medical grounds. 67
Today, collective social protection takes the form of ‘ social guarantees ’ 68
or of ‘ collective guarantees for employees ’ .
69 They are fi nanced by the
company, and attract tax incentives and favourable rates for the employers
’contributions. In principle, they are the result of collective agreements,
and are designed to include risks not covered by the social security, or only
incompletely. 70 They are at the intersection of labour law, social security
law and insurance law, and have two features in common. The fi rst is that
their fi nancial management is externalised; collecting social contributions
from companies and paying benefi ts to employees are tasks devolved upon
specialised agencies. Employees thus hold a debt claim against these bodies,
distinct from the salary claim, although it too stems from the employment
contract. As in social security law, the involvement of a third party, who
owes the welfare benefi ts, is a mechanism enabling the short time of the
contract to be harmonised with the long time of the worker ’ s life, without

the latter being dependent on an employer ’ s paternalism. The other feature
these guarantees have in common is that they spread the fi nancial burden
across the contributing members. But the way this equalisation is organised
is the cause of irreconcilable tensions between two different visions of the
system. For some, this is fi rst of all a market, and as such should be open
to competition between service providers. For others, it is the expression
of occupational solidarity, which should be encouraged. From the perspective
of free competition, the equalisation is achieved exclusively through
actuarial techniques applied to aggregate risks; that is, it involves simply a
calculation of probability, true to its vision inspired by governance by numbers.
Consequently, it is hostile to social bonds, viewing them as nothing but
a risk factor. From the perspective of solidarity, the role of equalisation is to
ensure that everyone enjoys certain protections, and also to compensate for
inequalities in wealth and in exposure to these risks. In other words, it obeys
the rule of ‘ to each according to his capacity, to each according to his needs ’ .
This is still the crowning principle of the mutuelles today, whose mission
is, through ‘ securing against risk, through solidarity and mutual aid [ … ],
to contribute to the cultural, moral, intellectual and physical development
of their members, and the improvement of their living conditions ’ .
71 These
goals are of course entirely alien to the insurance market.
When a scheme for ‘ employment security ’became law in 2013, it created
a head-on clash between these two visions. In return for ‘ negotiation
over anticipated economic changes ’ , that is, the weakening of the binding
force of employment contracts, ‘ new individual rights for securing
career pathways ’were introduced. 72 However, this resounding announcement
proved hollow, as the very fi rst article shows: the provision simply
extended the right to complementary cover for illness, maternity
and accident to all employees. How are we to understand this abuse of
language by which one of the oldest rights granted to employees — the right
to health cover — is presented as a ‘ new right ’ ?The solution to this enigma
can be found not in labour law but in social security legislation, which
increasingly refuses to cover what are called ‘ minor health risks ’ . Over the
last 20 years, as Didier Tabuteau has shown, French social security has
operated a ‘ salami policy ’whereby it ‘ cuts up obligatory health cover into
fi ne slices so that it is gradually absorbed, and not rejected, by the bodies
handling complementary social protection ’ .
73 In the context of drastic
reductions in ‘ public spending ’ , this underhand process which privatises the
most profi table sectors of the gigantic market in health, seems by now to

be irreversible. 74 The total expenditure on health in 2012 was 243 billion
euros, the equivalent of 12 per cent of the GDP. 75 But — through the magic
of governance by numbers — one has only to privatise the service for the
fi gure to disappear from the expenditure column and transform miraculously
into an economic growth factor for the nation. This is what occurred
with the market in health protection, which represented 31.1 billion euros in
2011, 76 a fi gure which automatically increases every time the social security
reduces the number of situations it covers. It is much clearer, in this light,
why complementary health cover was given such a high profi le in the law on
employment security. Far from giving employees ‘ new rights ’to help them
face the increased insecurity of the job market, these rights simply tempered
the effects of the reduced health cover provided by the state ’ s social security,
while at the same time the methodical privatisation of health cover continued,
under the label of reducing ‘ public expenditure ’ .

B. The Market versus Solidarity

There remained, then, the issue of the type of privatisation to choose:
should there be free competition and the insurance market, or national
solidarity systems and non-profi t-making bodies ?The generalisation of
complementary health insurance, introduced with the law of 2013 on
employment security, gave the insurance lobby the chance to table this
vexed issue, which had been coming back and back ever since 1945. The
2013 law authorised the social partners to develop ‘ a high degree of solidarity
’within occupational sectors, by providing that a single body should
handle this protection. In 2011, the lawfulness of designating this one body
was recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union, despite
its penchant for economic liberalisation. 77 But the French Constitutional
Council handed down a decision of infringement of the right to free enterprise
and freedom of contract, and achieved the near-impossible in not even
mentioning solidarity. 78 Whereas this decision satisfi ed a long-standing

demand on the part of the insurance sector, small and medium-sized businesses
regarded it as a disaster, and stressed the vulnerability of small businesses,
henceforth exposed to the ‘ soliciting and pressures of all sorts which
the insurance sector will not hesitate to exert ’ , as the representative of the
Union of Artisans stated. 79
The generalisation of complementary health insurance highlighted two
very different conceptions of the rights designed to protect the worker ’ s
employment over time. The version chosen by Parliament was that of collective
guarantees which are realised individually. They are collective not only
because of the nature of the act which creates them (a collective agreement),
but also because the agreement ’ s signatories are authorised to ground these
rights in a regime of solidarity managed by the representatives of those who
fi nance it. When these individual rights, which are meant to secure employees
against risk throughout their working lives, are backed up by this sort of
regime of solidarity, these rights are social rights. The conception imposed
by the French Constitutional Council was, by contrast, that of purely individual
rights, which are not rooted in a regime of solidarity between members
of the same profession, but in a debt claim against a fi nancial body or
insurance company. In other words, these are not strictly speaking social
rights but patrimonial rights, based not on solidarity but on capitalisation.
This second, purely fi nancial, vision supports an expansionist market forever
in search of greater liquidity of ‘ human capital ’ . It ousts the principle
of solidarity, increases inequalities between employees, and endorses the
‘ Matthew effect ’ , whereby those who have will receive even more, and those
who have not will receive even less. As the latest developments in other areas
of social protection have shown, one of the determinant conditions of the
system ’ s effi ciency is protection of the principle of solidarity. A particularly
striking example of this is professional training. The French Constitution
states that ‘ the Nation guarantees equal access of the child and the adult to
instruction, professional training and culture ’ .
80 The ‘ Delors ’Law of 16 July
1971 realised this social guarantee, and laid the foundations for the French
system of continuing professional development (CPD). At the time, it was
decided to set up a market in training services, rather than making CPD into
a public service (like education), or linked to a non-profi t-making regime of
solidarity. So on this particular market, a demand for training from companies
meets a supply from training providers. The system is fi nanced not
by welfare contributions but by taxes. Companies must spend at least a
minimum sum on training, which may be partially spent by the training
activities they organise for their own staff; the rest is handed over to certifi ed
bodies, whose structure is repeatedly rethought. Since 2009, these bodies

5 March 2014. This reform increased the fi nancing and the role of the Fund set up by the social
partners for safeguarding career paths. 20 %of the Fund will be pooled across industry sectors
to benefi t the employees of small businesses, who lost out heavily in the previous system, which
was entirely founded on the idea of regulating a market in professional training. 83 French Labour Code, Art L.6323-1, modifi ed by Law No 2014-288 of 5 March 2014. 84 French Labour Code, Art L.6323-3.

must jointly represent the social partners, and cannot themselves be training
providers. This market in training is regulated by industry-level collective
negotiation and by central government and regional administrations.
Despite the many attempts since 1971 to reform this market, it has continued
to generate considerable inequalities in access to training. Those
who lose out the most are small- and medium-sized enterprises, women,
and job-seekers — the sign that the ‘ Matthew effect ’is indeed taking its toll.
As a recent report to Parliament states: ‘ The system is so unsuccessful in
redistribution that SMEs of 10 to 49 employees fi nance the training policies
of larger-sized businesses to the tune of 50 million euros. Less than 3 %of
the sums collected for training provision are disparity-adjusted to the benefi
t of SMEs. ’ 81 This report illustrates the ongoing inequalities generated by
dismissing the principle of solidarity when establishing rights attached to
the employee ’ s person. In the case of professional training, these inequalities
were so glaring that in 2014 a cross-industry agreement between the social
partners became law, in order to include an element of solidarity in favour
of small business employees, and not simply follow the rules of the market
in professional training. 82 Another effect of this relative retreat of market
logic in favour of the principle of solidarity was the law ’ s provision for the
creation of a personal training account open to all individuals, and valid
from leaving school right up to retirement. 83 The account is available not
only for employees in work. It can be used by account-holders as they wish;
for example, they do not have to obtain their employer ’ s consent to the
training — which is partly fi nanced by the company — if it takes place outside
of working hours. Lastly, ‘ the account-holder ’ s accumulated training hours
are not lost when changing jobs or in the event of loss of employment ’ .
84
This is called the ‘ portability ’of professional training rights, which, like a
savings account, can be drawn on throughout the individual ’ s life in the
case of career diffi culties or, at the other extreme, to achieve new career
goals.
Although many of these ‘ new rights ’attached to the individual — working
time accounts, skills ’assessments (or skills’ ‘balance sheets’ — bilans de
compétence), personal training accounts, etc — use a vocabulary drawn from
banking, this does not necessarily mean that they are backed on capitalisation.
As part of the individual ’ s labour force status, they are inalienable

and non-distrainable. They are a grey area between patrimonial and nonpatrimonial
rights. 85 And above all, they are mostly backed by the solidarity
of the members of an occupational group, and not by an amount of capital.
As such, these rights are a modern version of a type of wealth well known
in some traditional societies, in which a person is rich not because they have
accumulated a pile of gold but because they have forged links with a suffi
cient number of other people to be able to rely on their help. ‘ People not
purse are a man ’ s wealth ’ , as a Bamileke proverb puts it. 86 The rich man is
one who has ‘ lots of people ’he can rely upon. This does not dispense with
the need for contingency planning, but, as in the case of African tontines,
the safest savings prove to be those backed up by solidarity between people,
who are, by turns, creditors and debtors in the same system.
Yet the idea of economic security underpinned by solidarity between people
rather than by an individual ’ s capital is anathema to ultra-liberal dogma.
It regards society as a collection of subjects surrounded by objects, in which
the alpha and omega of the subject ’ s relation to the object is individual ownership.
That is why ultra-liberals have such immense diffi culty envisaging
human beings as interconnected with their lived environments, both social
and natural.
The concept of ‘ social drawing rights ’is useful for understanding these
new rights attached to the person, as well as their similarities and differences
from social security, which also embodied a return to rights founded
on solidarity. 87 These rights are attached to the person of the worker and
not to their employment, which is why they can ensure the person ’ s continuing
status within the workforce whatever the disparities and discontinuities
in their working lives. They allow employees to step outside the relation
of subordination and devote themselves for a time to another socially useful
activity. They are drawing rights, because they can only be ‘ drawn ’ , or
exercised, under two conditions: attaining a certain level of ‘ reserves ’ , and
the decision to use these. And they are social rights, not only in the way
they are constituted (different sources of matching funds, mobilising different
circles of solidarity), but also in their objectives (exercising these rights
gives access to socially useful activities). Social security protects against the
risks of everyday life, while social drawing rights enable people to have real
freedom of choice in how they conduct their professional lives. Recent legislation
on ‘ securing career paths ’seems to adopt the perspective of these new
268 ‘Genuinely Human Work in Humane Conditions’ II

rights, particularly with respect to professional training and development,
and health and safety at work. However, the overwhelming tendency is still
for work to be conceived in a reifi ed way, as ‘ human capital ’held hostage
to the total market. We can see, therefore, that ties of allegiance are indeed
advancing inexorably, but the form they take is not set in stone. All depends
on the strength of collective action and the political responses to it.
The employment relationship has always been at the heart of how people
are governed in the modern age. This somewhat austere legal analysis of its
contemporary metamorphoses was the prerequisite for proceeding to identify,
in more general terms, the structure of the ties of allegiance developing
at all levels of our societies.

The Structure of Ties of Allegiance

Ubi emolumentum, ibi onus. 1

THE TIES BETWEEN controlling companies and subsidiaries, and
imperial states and controlling companies, have a similar structure
to the ties of allegiance examined above, which are operative in the
individual employment relationship.

I. ALLEGIANCE IN BUSINESS NETWORKS

A vivid image of the ties of allegiance operating in business networks
is provided by a particularly monstrous case, that of the Rana Plaza disaster
and its aftermath. The facts were widely reported in the Press: a Bangladeshi
garment factory situated on the outskirts of Dhaka supplied cheap clothing
to many Western retailers. On 24 April 2013, the company ’ s premises in the
building called Rana Plaza collapsed, causing 1,133 deaths, most of them
women workers, and 2,000 injured, many of them handicapped for life. The
images of this industrial catastrophe, the largest since the Bhopal disaster in
1984, were seen the world over, turning the spotlight — for a brief moment —
on the realities of work in poor countries in the age of globalisation.
The day before the accident, cracks had been observed in the building,
which was in imminent danger of collapsing. 2 The building was then evacuated.
The following day, the female garment workers, under the threat
of fi nes and wage deductions, were forced to return to their workstations.
Designed as residential accommodation, the building was built on marshy
ground and its use violated the most basic safety regulations. Without permission,
four extra fl oors had been built on top of the initial fi ve. A generator
had been place on the roof, and its vibrations, coupled with those of the
machines, caused the building to collapse. The garments found in the rubble

This accident gave the lie to the fable that globalisation provides workers
in emerging economies with a fulfi lling and prosperous life. For a while, it
drew the Press ’ s attention to the social impact of the new forms of organisation
of work in the globalised economy. And since it risked casting doubt
on the civilising virtues of economic globalisation, the latter ’ s devotees
were quick to stress the proper message. In the words of the Editor of a
major French Left-wing weekly, ‘ We would be quite wrong to embark on
an angelic condemnation of globalisation or declare that its days are numbered
[ … ] For these young women, the workshop is preferable to the family
and the economic oppression they experience in rural areas. Paradoxically,
their job at Rana Plaza gave them a form of freedom. ’ 3 This colonial discourse
in a new guise claims, as it did previously, that one can decide from
Paris what is good for these ‘ natives ’in southern countries, while bracketing
out the fact that some died crushed by the steamroller of all-out trade.
The President of the Chamber of Commerce in Lyon had already — at the end
of the nineteenth century — summed it up: ‘ civilising people means teaching
them to work in order to buy, trade, and spend ’ .

image, most of the Western fi rms involved in the tragedy made much of
their ‘ social responsibility ’ , but when the Press — whose role regarding the
deregulation of international trade is similar to that played by the major
industrial-era strikes — voiced its indignation, these companies were forced
to confront their real responsibilities. Faced with pressure from the media,
and from two international organisations which had developed good practice
guidelines in the area of corporate social responsibility — the ILO and
the OECD — these companies, which in 2013, the year of the accident, raked
in 24.5 billion dollars from Bangladesh, were obliged to take action to prevent
such accidents in the future.
This event shows that removing barriers to trade also has negative effects
for transnational companies. On the one hand, they have thrown off
state control and can thus freely relocate, and practise fi scal, employment
and environmental forum shopping. The larger companies create networks
across the globe, in which they enslave smaller companies. On the
other hand, they enter a sort of legal vacuum which exposes them to new
risks, which they attempt to contain by brandishing their capacity for selfregulation
and their ‘ social responsibility ’ .
As long as the international legal order was made up of juxtaposed sovereign
states who controlled their own frontiers, business activities were
situated at the intersection of private and public law. The state dealt with
what the Digest calls ‘ sacred things ’ , that is, the domain of things which are
beyond calculation, such as personal status and the survival of the political
community. 5 Relieved of this responsibility, exchanges between individuals
could then be pursued purely according to a logic of calculated utility.
Milton Friedman ’ s famous line that ‘ the one and only social responsibility
of business is to increase its profi ts ’ ,
6 can be seen as displaying a very
primitive conception of business, 7 but it is not in itself scandalous: as long
as entrepreneurs obey the law and pay their taxes, there is indeed no reason
why they should be required to envisage occupational and environmental
issues over the longer period of human life. Small businesses operate within
these limits, but today transnational companies escape state control because
of trade deregulation, and are allowed to choose the laws most profi table
to them from the whole planet. In other words, the present context enables
them to elude what the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948
calls the rule of law.
The Rana Plaza disaster is a tragic illustration of the opportunities
and risks for transnational fi rms of stepping outside the law. They can

this. It stands at 0.6 per cent; that is, at 1/100th of the distributor ’ s margin: 9

But on the other hand, these multinationals run the risk of having to answer
for violations of fundamental human rights, when the over-exploitation of
human beings and natural resources becomes known to the public. Unlike
the integrated production chain of the Fordist manufacturing system, transnational
businesses create networks of autonomous legal and economic entities,
in a typically feudal structure. 10 Legally speaking, these companies are
not liable for any wrongdoings committed, or risks incurred, by their subsidiaries,
their sub-contractors or their suppliers. Legal personality protects
them from prosecution if there is an accident. To a certain extent, therefore,
this mode of work organisation enables the sites of economic power to be
separated off from the sites of imputation of liability, as the last 20 years of
sub-standard food product scandals have shown on numerous occasions.
The other side of this coin, however, is that the transnationals no longer

have direct control over manufacturing conditions, and the indirect control
they try to keep is diluted along the chain of sub-contractors and suppliers.
This has two negative consequences for them: they lose their technical skills,
such that their vassal companies can one day become their competitors —
one of the bitter truths to emerge from European and American fi rms ’conquest
of the Chinese market; and they also risk fi nding themselves at the
centre of a humanitarian and ecological scandal, their brand name dragged
through the mud in the media, spattered with the blood of the female garment
workers of Rana Plaza. In such cases, the fa ç ade of legal personality is
no longer much help to them because public opinion, that is, their customers,
will hold them responsible.
As a result, major businesses have chosen to restructure their relationships
with suppliers and sub-contractors to avoid being held directly responsible
for work-related or environmental damage. They want to be able to monitor
their activities and provide them with the means to operate in a responsible
fashion. Although technically the ties of allegiance forged between
companies are not the same for a relation between parent company and
subsidiary, contracting company and contractors, or clients and suppliers,
these relations are all modes of vassalage, and can consequently be treated
together. The relation of vassalage becomes clearer if we compare it with the
relation of salaried employment and its recent transformations, as discussed
in the last chapter. Allegiance in employment is perceptible in the employee ’ s
autonomy-in-subordination with respect to the employer; as we have seen,
where the bond of allegiance requires greater commitment from the employee
’ s person. Employees can no longer simply obey orders mechanically for a
certain length of time in a certain place prescribed in advance, but they have
to be totally mobilised to achieve the objectives assigned, and they must
also accept the related performance evaluation procedures. In exchange, the
employer must be mindful of employees ’mental and physical health, and
their professional capacities, in order to maintain their ‘ employability ’on
the labour market.
Similar ties of allegiance are formalised in the two agreements signed after
the Rana Plaza disaster, one between mostly European companies, 11 the
other between North American ones. 12 The ‘ American ’agreement was less
restrictive, and made sure the unions had no hand in supervising its application.
The ‘ European ’agreement was more ambitious and provided more
food for thought. It was signed, on 15 May 2013, by a number of multinationals
and the international unions of the relevant industry sector, Industri
ALL and Uni Global Union, under the auspices of the ILO. It was applicable
274 The Structure of Ties of Allegiance

13 Le Monde, 14 October 2014.

for a fi ve-year period, during which security and fi re risk inspections in the
textile industry would be stepped up, and workers ’health and occupational
safety conditions would be improved. To date, the agreement applies to 103
brands of purchasers, with planned inspections of 1566 factories. Its implementation
is supervised by a steering committee chaired by a representative
of the ILO and comprising equal numbers of customer companies and trade
unions. A binding dispute settlement mechanism has also been devised.
The Agreement has fi ve goals: to set up credible inspections; to work on
prevention, ensuring that factories comply with safety standards; to provide
training on safety issues; to introduce a bottom-up communications system;
and to guarantee transparency on the audited sites (access to data). The signatory
companies have pledged funds corresponding to the pro rata value
of their orders, to train the inspectors, carry out the inspections, and to get
factories up to standard. The fi rst inspection report was delivered in autumn
2014: it revealed 80,000 infringements of safety rules, and prescribed work
estimated at more than one billion dollars. 13
Three features of ties of allegiance become apparent in this collective
formalisation of relations of production. The agreement confi rms suppliers
’dependence because they are obliged to accept the inspections commissioned
by the consortium of signatory companies, and they must apply the
corrective measures prescribed by the inspectors, and implement the training
programmes on staff safety. The economic penalty for non-compliance
is extremely harsh: they will not be allowed to trade with any of the companies
which are parties to the agreement, a situation which amounts to
economic banishment. This dependence means that suppliers must bare all
for the signatory companies, just like employees in their appraisal interviews.
Secondly, the customer companies must support their suppliers so that they
can assume their new responsibilities. This requires the economic relationship
to be viewed in a long-term perspective, a dimension usually ignored
by ‘ value-creating ’cost-killers. The customer companies vow to ‘ maintain
long-term sourcing relationships with Bangladesh ’and to negotiate terms
such that the supplier factories are fi nancially able to ‘ respect the security
requirements stipulated in the Agreement ’ . This support can also take the
form of fi nancial aid provided by the main company to the supplier. The
agreement also sets up a system of fi nancial solidarity between the signatories,
whereby the amount contributed by each company for inspection and
training is proportional to its turnover in Bangladesh. Together with the
adoption of shared safety standards, this mutualised auditing framework
functions as a genuine working conditions watchdog, so that the costs of
safety at work are never the object of a competitive race to the bottom.
Lastly, the agreement establishes that customer – supplier relations are jointly
Allegiance in Business Networks 275

14 The scope of this right includes: a guarantee of employment during the works to implement
security standards; the right to withdraw from dangerous situations; the right to collective
representation (50 %on health and safety committees, which are to be created by the
Agreement); a complaints procedure. 15 French Labour Code, Art L.8222-1, which obliges customer companies to ensure their
sub-contractors are not employing illegal workers. 16 Cour de cassation, Chambre criminelle, 25 September 2012, No 10-82938 ( Erika case),

and severally liable with respect to certain third parties. The supplier ’ s
employees can thus get behind their employer ’ s fa ç ade of legal personality,
and submit their case directly to the customer company to which their
employer is answerable. The customer company consequently has a right
to intervene in the management of the supplier ’ s staff on issues concerning
the application of the agreement. 14 This Agreement, considered exemplary
not only by the unions, but also by the ILO and the OECD, is indeed a
model of its kind, due to its international dimension and its standard-setting
character. Although its geographical focus is limited (the textile industry in
Bangladesh), as is its material range (the safety of buildings, fi re prevention),
its normative structure is much the same as many mandatory provisions
already present in domestic and European law.
Transnational companies are not, however, the only ones to develop a
legal defi nition of allegiance. The relations of dependence between companies
have long been the object of legislation and case law in domestic
law, where the same three characteristics are evident: the supervision of the
vassal by the suzerain; the support of the suzerain by the vassal; and the
responsibility of the suzerain for the doings of the vassal.
As customers, multinationals have thus been given the power and the duty
to supervise the supply chain, and to combat illegal work by checking their
subcontractors ’registration and employee declarations. 15 A similar legal
obligation emerged from the Erika case, concerning the chartering of shipping
vessels. The Erika ecological disaster in the Atlantic was caused by the
break-up in heavy seas of a 25-year-old oil tanker unfi t to sail. The company
Total denied civil and criminal liability, on the grounds that it was neither
the owner nor the charterer of the vessel, since the transport contract had
been drawn up by one of its subsidiaries. However, Total was found guilty
of not exercising ‘ the due diligence incumbent upon it ’ , insofar as it had not
carried out the technical checks which it had itself envisaged, in accordance
with which it ‘ had the right to board the tanker Erika, to observe operations
of loading and unloading, to inspect the cisterns and to have access to
the ship ’ s documents, all of which gave it the power to supervise the cargo
and also the ship ’ s functioning ’ .

17 According to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, ‘ any person owning, operating, or demise
chartering a vessel ’is liable for the pollution it causes. 18 French Commercial Code, Art L.442-6-I. See R Libchaber , ‘ Relation commerciale é tablie

sociale) of the Cour de cassation, Goodyear Dunlop of 1 February 2011, F-P + B, No 10-30.045,
10-30.046, 10-30.047, 10-30.048. The Commercial Division is much less bold, and tends to
keep the iron curtain of legal personality down, for example, in order to protect a parent company
from liability for its subsidiary ’ s bankruptcy, even when its actions were contributory factors.

all those directly or indirectly involved in a transport are considered liable,
a rule which prompts charterers to check the conditions under which their
contracted transporters operate. 17
Concretely, the duty to support means that the suzerain company must
make sure that its vassals are economically viable. This duty is enshrined in
the French Commercial Code for the relations between large retailers and
their suppliers, in the form of a prohibition on

subjecting or seeking to subject a trading partner to obligations that create a
signifi cant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties; obtaining, or
seeking to obtain clearly abusive terms concerning prices, payment times, terms
of sale or services that do not come under the purchase or sale obligations, under
the threat of an abrupt total or partial termination of business relations; abruptly
breaking off an established business relationship, even partially, without prior
written notice commensurate with the duration of the business relationship and
consistent with the minimum notice period determined by the multi-sector agreements
in line with standard commercial practices. 18

The obligation to make sure that the vassal company is economically viable
has also been confi rmed in case law, regarding clandestine labour. 19 More
generally, a duty to be mindful of sub-contractors explains why companies
are obliged to keep them informed. 20 This could make a company liable for
the consequences of closing down its subsidiary, when there are no grounds
for this other than increasing its own profi ts to the detriment of jobs in the
subsidiary. 21
Joint and several liability is a technique increasingly used for the legal
control of company networks, in both domestic and European law. The
suzerain company is accordingly responsible for the doings of it vassal.
Unsurprisingly, the EU Court of Justice admitted this ‘ lifting of the veil ’on
companies ’legal personality whenever it was a question of enforcing EU
competition rules. 22 After recalling that in European law, an undertaking
‘ encompasses every entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of
the legal status of the entity or the way in which it is fi nanced ’ , the Court

stated that ‘ the concept of an undertaking, in the same context, must be
understood as designating an economic unit even if in law that economic
unit consists of several persons, natural or legal ’ . When an economic unit of
this sort infringes competition rules, the Court continued, ‘ according to the
principle of personal responsibility, that entity must answer for the infringement
’ . But who should be personally liable for the infringement when the
undertaking is an ‘ economic unit ’which transcends the legal personality of
the companies comprising it ?The Court had no doubt about it: ‘ the conduct
of a subsidiary may be imputed to the parent company in particular
where, although having a separate legal personality, that subsidiary does not
decide independently upon its own conduct on the market, but carries out,
in all material respects, the instructions given to it by the parent company …
having regard in particular to the economic, organisational and legal links
between those two legal entities ’ . In such a situation, the Court went on, ‘ the
parent company and its subsidiary form a single economic unit and therefore
form a single undertaking ’ . The parent company may therefore be fi ned
‘ without having to establish [its] personal involvement in the infringement ’ .
This case law is particularly interesting because it allows the courts to get
round the different legal personalities and impute responsibility to where
the power really lies.
In French labour law, a similar solution was adopted to combat clandestine
work: any person who indirectly uses clandestine workers is jointly
and severally responsible for paying the corresponding taxes and employer ’ s
contributions, and for settling their wages. In the case of sub-contractors,
the company and the sub-contractor are jointly and severally responsible. 23
More generally, joint and several responsibility results from the concept of
‘ co-employers ’in French labour law, a concept which the courts can use to
enable employees of a subsidiary to identify the controlling company, and
to bring proceedings accordingly. 24
In English law, a parent company ’ s joint and several liability has recently
been upheld in case law concerning the health and safety of a subsidiary ’ s
employee. Following a particularly interesting reasoning, the parent company
was judged responsible for this employee ’ s health and safety. 25 Here,
the company ’ s responsibility was not deduced from the effective supervisory
power of the parent company over the subsidiary, but was due to the
278 The Structure of Ties of Allegiance

concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. 27 cf the Savary Report on the government bill to increase the liability of contracting authorities

superior knowledge it had, or should have had, of the dangerous nature of
the working conditions managed by its subsidiary.
The judge considered that, consequently, ‘ the parent company knew, or
ought to have known that the subsidiary or its employees would rely on its
using that superior knowledge for the employees ’protection ’ . The duty of
care incumbent upon the suzerain extends over both the vassal and the vassal ’ s
employees. This duty is therefore not the consequence but the cause of the
parent company ’ s involvement in the affairs of its subsidiary, an involvement
which is necessary in order to protect the subsidiary and its employees.
European law recently introduced the joint and several liability of customer
companies, with a view to increasing protection for posted workers
providing services. Ever since the Bolkestein proposal, European authorities
had attempted to introduce competition between national legislations,
using the international posting of employees as a key weapon. This was a
way for companies to practise forum shopping for social legislation without
even having to relocate their activities — a recipe taken straight out of the
book of governance by numbers. For example, a 1996 Directive authorised,
under not very stringent conditions, employees to work under the
foreign legislation of countries where there were lower levels of protection,
using a foreign company of service providers. 26 Thus European law,
in a gesture which takes us back to the personality of laws, encourages
competitive practices between employees in the same country but working
under different legislations. The number of posted workers employed
in France, as a way of dodging employer ’ s contributions, has soared to an
offi cial fi gure 20 times higher than 12 years ago, a hike from 7,495 in 2000
to 169,613 in 2012. 27 In 2014, a complementary Directive attempted to
remedy the most fl agrant abuses arising from these practices, yet without
challenging the ‘ competitive advantage ’which some Member States gain
through exporting low-cost employees. 28 Labour-exporting companies thus
continue to evade payment of the social contributions which their competitors
in the same country are obliged make. The 2014 Directive principally
sought to protect the employees concerned from not being paid by the traders
in people who hire them to work abroad for the destination company.
It provided that the destination company has joint and several liability for
the payment of the salaries of these posted workers. 29 This applies only

to the building trade, but Member States can tighten the provisions and
include other sectors. They can also authorise companies to guard against
this risk by fulfi lling due diligence obligations.
30 This internalisation of rules
is a technique on the rise, as we shall see regarding compliance programmes.
Joint and several liability also fi gures in environmental law, when a parent
company wrongfully contributes to the bankruptcy of a subsidiary, which
is therefore unable to fi nance the rehabilitation of the site(s) it occupied.
Today, liability extends not only to the parent company, but, where applicable,
to the companies of which this parent company is itself a subsidiary
or a sub-subsidiary. 31
The ‘ Catala ’draft bill for the reform of French contract law suggested
that this type of liability be given broader scope, and that ‘ one who manages
or organises the work of another person and gains an economic advantage
from this is liable for the harm caused by the latter in carrying out this
activity ’ . A similar rule was planned, namely that ‘ one who controls the
economic or patrimonial activity of a dependent professional, although acting
in his own interests, when the victim establishes that the harmful event
is related to this control ’will be considered liable. 32 The adoption of this
bold proposal would have provided a legal basis for the adage ubi emolumentum,
ibi onus ( ‘ Whoever benefi ts bears the burden ’ ), extending liability
for the harmful consequences of an economic activity to whoever controls it
and profi ts from it. It could have prevented the involvement of French companies
in the Rana Plaza disaster, for instance. But the Medef, the French
employers ’union, wheeled out the heavy artillery and effectively blasted
the proposal off the legislative map, 33 such that the draft bill presented in

drawn attention in the French media to a practice developing over the last
20 years in the United States: multinationals suspected of having infringed
American legislation on corruption or tax fraud, or who breached the embargos
decided by the American government against certain countries, were
obliged to submit to ‘ compliance programmes ’ . The accusations were based
on texts which provide for the application of US law abroad. Examples
include the Helms-Berton (1996) and Amato-Kennedy (1996) Acts, concerning
the embargos against Cuba and Iran. Or the Dodd-Franck Act of
2010, which ignored the Supreme Court ’ s Morrison ruling, 35 and endowed
the Security Exchange Commission (SEC), the stock exchange watchdog,
with the power to crack down on ‘ any conduct in the United States which
contributes signifi cantly to an infringement, even if the fi nancial transaction
was agreed outside the US and involves only foreign investors. ’Or equally,
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in its 1998 revised version, which
applies to all people connected in some way to the American territory. This
can include a company trading on the American markets, 36 or even one
which has signed agreements whose currency is in dollars. These provisions
also make it possible to get behind the corporate veil of the different companies
which make up a business. 37
Compliance procedures can be implemented by companies voluntarily in
the countries in which they operate, to avoid legal proceedings, but they can
also be imposed, and not solely by the United States. The World Bank uses
them to exclude companies suspected of corruption from bidding for the
projects it helps fi nance. 38 But the US is the only country powerful enough
to oblige multinationals to accept some of its laws, in the form of compliance
programmes. A remarkable joint research project, headed by Antoine
Garapon and Pierre Servan-Schreiber, has recently shown the extraordinary
growth in these programmes over the last decade. 39 This new form of negotiated
justice should not be confused with the practice of the ‘ guilty plea ’ .
The latter takes place before a judge, whereas these procedures to bring
companies into line are precisely aimed at keeping the courts out of any
bilateral negotiations between the Department of Justice and the company
Multinationals’ Allegiance to Imperial States 281

40 On this schizophrenic position, see P Servan-Schreiber, ‘ L ’ avocat, serviteur de deux

under suspicion. Bilateral negotiation of this sort is what the Speedy Trial
Act of 1974 enabled, because it ensures that defendants have suffi cient time
to prove that their conduct has been blameless. In practice, however, the
suspected company is required to confess its wrongdoing during this time
period, and without any of the normal guarantees of an adversarial process.
The procedure is as follows: the US Department of Justice (DoJ) receives
information suggesting that a certain company has infringed American law,
for example by trading with Cuba, corrupting a foreign civil servant in
order to obtain a market opening, or helping to commit tax fraud against
the US. The indicting information can come from any source — and the DoJ
is not obliged to reveal its provenance — including from informers enticed
by the prospect of receiving a reward proportional to the penalty infl icted
on the company: the traditions of the Far West die hard. There are sound
reasons to believe that the information can also be supplied by the National
Security Agency (NSA), whose immense ears pick up information which it
can see no good reason not to divulge, at times, to the DoJ. Armed with
these suspicions, the DoJ announces to the company that it will be taken to
court, unless it fulfi lls the following three conditions.
The fi rst condition is that the company should confess its wrongdoing
in greater detail, in a statement of facts which confi rms the DoJ ’ s version,
and which the company pledges never to contest subsequently (a ‘ muzzled
clause ’ ). This confi rmation of the facts, as presented by the DoJ, is not an
acknowledgment of guilt in the legal sense because it is produced under
threat of legal proceedings, not as part of them. The consent simply confi
rms a certain state of the facts, which the company is thereafter obliged
to investigate (at its own cost) by means of an internal inquiry carried out
by a lawyers ’offi ce approved by the public prosecutor. The company thus
pledges to be entirely open with the investigators, who behave like directors
of conscience — inquisitorial but also protective of those who confi de
in them. 40 The cost of this inquiry, which involves combing through all
the documents and correspondence connected with the alleged facts, can
reach astronomical fi gures — one billion dollars, in the case of Siemens 41— to
which should be added the settlement fi ne negotiated between the parties.
The second condition is precisely the payment of a settlement fi ne.
The fi gures for these attain millions, even billions, of dollars, and they
are a particularly profi table source of revenue for the US Treasury because
they are mainly levied against foreign fi rms. 42 The American authorities
282 The Structure of Ties of Allegiance

Corrupt Practices Act, Title 15, Ch 2B, §e.

can also demand punitive measures against natural persons who abetted
the violations. The idea here is to prevent corporate liability from replacing
the responsibilities of those who benefi tted from the wrongdoing: the persons
involved are liable to disciplinary sanctions (losing their job) and criminal
proceedings.
The third condition is to bring the company into line with American law
by setting up a compliance procedure, based on programmes supplied by
the DoJ, and supervised by an independent monitor ratifi ed by the DoJ. 43
Unlike the idea of conformity, which implies the state of corresponding to
a norm, the term compliance implies a procedure of standardisation, and
hence the programming of how a company should operate: any deviation
from the norm by the company must be abolished, so that the latter ’ s normal
state of functioning conforms to the demands of the American authorities.
Additionally, unlike voluntary monitoring of conformity, the programming
involved in compliance is supervised by an independent inspectorate for
the entire duration of the agreement (from one to four years). Its role is to
supervise the application of the agreement, report any shortcomings, and
certify at the end of the process that the company has now adopted a suffi
ciently robust compliance programme for the attested violations not to
recur. Another particularity of this system is that it requires compliance with
American law alone, despite its possible confl ict with the legislation of other
countries in which the company also operates. For example, on issues of
transparency, American law may force a French company to disclose to
the American authorities information which under French law is expressly
classifi ed.
The commitments emerging from the compliance programme are set out
in a ‘ deferred prosecution agreement ’ , which guarantees that there will be
no legal proceedings for as long as the company respects the agreement.
The threat of prosecution is extremely effective because were prosecution
to be triggered, the multinationals concerned would be banished from the
American markets until the end of the trial. The post-Rana Plaza agreements
also brandished this threat of banishment, but whereas the market power
of multinationals is within particular industries and within the countries in
which they operate, the USA ’ s power market is infi nitely greater, effectively
sovereign, and it cannot be challenged without economic death. To date,
no multinational has taken the risk of banishment, and all have complied
with the DoJ ’ s desiderata. They have thus sworn allegiance to the American
authorities, entering into a legal structure similar to the one identifi ed in the
employment relationship and in the relations between customer companies
and their sub-contractors or suppliers.

Conclusion

Ways Forward

Mathematical formalism, whose medium, number, is the most abstract form of the
immediate, arrests thought at mere immediacy. The actual is validated, knowledge
confi nes itself to repeating it, thought makes itself mere tautology. The more
completely the machinery of thought subjugates existence, the more blindly it is
satisfi ed with reproducing it.

Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, ‘ The concept of Enlightenment ’ 1

ALTHOUGH A FEELING of civilisational disquiet is nothing new —
it was diagnosed by Freud in 1929, in the aftermath of the Wall
Street crash 2— it certainly seems to have gripped Europe today with
an intensity unknown since the Second World War. Legal analysis may not
probe to the depths of psychoanalysis, but it can certainly help identify the
underlying forces at work in a given society, and diagnose the ills affecting
it. Our contemporary economistic credo simply explains away this disquiet
by means of formulas, indicators and charts. Thus we are shown graphs
of variations in unemployment rates, with the promise that the curve will
shortly ‘ show an upturn ’ , according to a logic which blithely confuses how
a situation develops with its geometrical representation. 3 These sorts of confusion
refl ect more generally how the regime of governance by numbers
loses all contact with reality, and substitutes the map for the territory in
its organisation and running of public affairs. The dismissal of the real in
favour of its quantifi ed representation leads to what the American economist
Paul Krugman has called ‘ an intellectual breakdown ’(applied here to
the French leadership), 4 the result not of mental, but of institutional deterioration.
This phenomenon has various causes, and has taken various forms
over its long history, as we have attempted to show.
284 Conclusion

that has now turned into intellectual collapse. And Europe ’ s second depression goes on and on ’
(P Krugman, ‘Scandal in France’ The New York Times (16 January 2014)).

With the advent of modernity, the age-old Greek ideal of government by
laws rather than by men developed a new fi gure: government as a machine.
An identical collective imaginary thereafter subtended the development of
science and technology, and of law and institutions. It was the dream of a
world entirely mastered and transparent to itself, in which each person may
act as a sovereign subject, freed from the power of men as from material
needs. Classical physics, the second industrial revolution and the rule of law
contributed, each differently, to giving this imaginary its fi rst modern form,
that of a world ruled by general, abstract laws which can ensure that actions
are performed effi ciently. After the Second World War, a new mode of this
impersonal power developed, with numbers progressively superseding laws
as the basis of obligations between people. Governance by numbers, sustained
by the ICT revolution, attempted to bring about a society in which
there would be no heteronomy, in which legislation would be replaced by
programming and rules by technical regulation. Soviet central planning was
the fi rst system to reduce the function of the law to an instrument for implementing
calculations of usefulness. The cybernetic imaginary amplifi ed this
tendency by imposing its vision of a networked natural and human world
in which the difference between humans, animals and machines tends to
zero, since each can be conceived as a homeostatic system communicating
with the others. This new stage corresponded to the passage from economic
liberalism, in which economic calculations were subject to the law, to
neoliberalism, in which the law was piloted by economic calculations. The
market paradigm is today applied to all human activities; it has replaced the
Basic Norm on a global scale. Capitalism has thus mutated into an anarcho-capitalism
which destroys frontiers, subjugates states and dismantles
the rules designed to protect the three fi ctional commodities identifi ed by
Karl Polanyi: nature; work; and money. And not a day passes without the
media — that modern equivalent of religious zealotry — banging on about
how necessary this subjugation is. Yet it cannot but result in the collapse
of the whole system: it was only within the framework of national legal
systems which can ensure some damage-limitation that the fi ction of nature,
work and money as commodities was sustainable.
Whenever an ideology loses a sense of limits, these will inevitably return
in catastrophic ways, as soon as its limitless pretentions come up against
the reality principle. So it is with our anarcho-capitalism, which gave us a
foretaste of its destructive potential in the 2008 fi nancial crisis, despite the
amazing sleight of hand of arguing in its aftermath for a rapid dismemberment
of the social state. We can predict that this dismemberment and the
establishment of calculations of individual utility as the sole norm — fl ying
in the face of democratic principles — will generate new forms of violence,

combined with the ecological disasters generated by the over-exploitation
of the planet ’ s natural resources. When the state no longer assumes its role
as guardian of people ’ s identity, and of their physical and economic security,
then people will inevitably pledge allegiance to any group claiming to
provide such guarantees — be it clans, religious factions, ethnic identities or
mafi a networks. Such networks of allegiance, both legal and illegal, have
already penetrated every level of human activity. Within them, each person
depends on the protection of those stronger than he and on the dedication
of those weaker. Governance by numbers, as a radical form of impersonal
power (an impersonality to which the law already aspired), has thus paradoxically
spawned a world of bonds of dependence. In it there can be no
difference marked between countries and businesses, or public and private.
The realm of the law had been structured around the vertical axis of a public
sphere (the sphere of the incalculable), and the horizontal plane of private
interests (which can be conceived as the sphere of mutually adjusting calculations
of individual utility). The suppression of the Law ’ s heteronomy — legal
rules treated as just another product competing on a market of norms — has
generated a double movement of privatisation of public responsibilities and
‘ publicisation ’of private ones. This is not a value judgment on our state of
affairs, but simply a snapshot of the laws in force today. It can show us why
governance by numbers is an unsustainable system, and why our representation
of the future is no longer one of revolution but of catastrophe.
One of the defi ning characteristics of the West is that it idolises ideas,
a tendency as dangerous when its object is law as when it is numbers.
The role of a legal system, in the epoch of ruling by law, was precisely to
temper this idolatrous tendency by fi ltering laws through systems of interpretation
which the law-makers themselves were obliged to respect. Arguably,
the same critical fi lters should be applied to numbers. Mathematics
are a potent tool, but they may also generate a sort of mysticism, as the
great Polish late-nineteenth-century mathematician Sophie Kowalevski
described, in a letter to a friend: ‘ Everything in life seems to me so drab, so
uninteresting. In such moments, there is nothing better than mathematics.
No words can describe the balm of feeling that a world exists from which
the Self is entirely absent. If only one could always speak only of impersonal
subjects! ’ 5 Kowalevski ’ s experience shows us the fascination exerted
by numbers, ever since Pythagoras, but also the exorbitant price paid for
letting calculation dominate the legal sphere: it eliminates any thought for
people of fl esh and blood. In order to avoid this, a sense of measure must
be preserved in every practice of quantifi cation. Law can help maintain or

restore this measure, by making it obligatory to observe the adversarial
principle in the way numbers are treated and interpreted, whenever the
results are to have normative force. 6 However, restoring this sense of measure
cannot be achieved without challenging politically the power which the
plutocratic ruling classes have won in most countries today. Their motivation
is anything but mystical, and their unbridled greed and destructive
power make Marx ’ s critique of capitalism from 150 years ago once again
acutely topical.
In view of the dogmatic position acquired by neoliberal economic doctrine,
including in the sphere of law, there is little chance that criticism of
this system of belief will be heard on the ‘ market for ideas ’ 7 which seems
to have replaced the public forum today. Criticism can nonetheless help us
refl ect on the future, and make the transition from diagnosis to antidotes.
And the fi rst thing to do is to dismantle the systems of allegiance being
woven before our very eyes as defensive reactions to the unsustainability of
the regime of governance by numbers.
This is why the employment relation, which has been the matrix of many
forms of government since the industrial era, has been a major focus here.
In tracking its transformations, we identifi ed the emergence of the tie of allegiance,
which in its modern form has two essential features. First, the total
mobilisation of one person in the service of another. Unlike its Taylorist
version, however, this mobilisation manages the mind as much as the body,
organising work not through mechanical obedience to orders but through
the programming of feedback. The corollary of the sphere of autonomy
granted to workers for carrying out their prescribed objectives is the right of
employers to have their workers ’ ‘ functioning ’measured and evaluated at
any time. The work objectives are thus made inseparable from quantitative
performance indicators which the worker has no part in defi ning. Workers
subjected to these ‘ objective indicators ’are divorced from the reality of the
world on which they act, and bound into a speculative spiral from which
they may not escape other than mentally deranged or criminally indicted.
The second feature of the tie of allegiance is the employer ’ s responsibility
to ensure that employees continue to be economically productive, to adapt
in ‘ real time ’to the needs of the market, whether they are in work or have
been made redundant. The degree of commitment required of the employer
depends on the occupational status of the employee, ranging from a maximum
for highly qualifi ed staff on permanent contracts, and hardly any at
all for the unqualifi ed casual worker. A similar situation obtains in relations
between dominant and less dominant businesses, and between the American

Empire and multinationals: vassal businesses swear to stand always at the
ready, constantly scrutinised and called to account by suzerain businesses
or the sovereign authority, which in return promise to see to their economic
survival.
The disappointing ruling of the French Constitutional Council on the
French Law on employment protection of 2013, discussed above, 8 is a
good example of how the total market can capture new protective measures
while stripping them of their dimension of solidarity. Employee protections,
which the employer must contribute to, were to be attached to
the employee in person, and not to his or her job. There are two ways of
conceiving this protection beyond the particular employment contract: in
terms of insurance, using actuarial risk assessments; or in terms of pooling
risks, based on solidarity within each industry sector. The Constitutional
Council ’ s decision in favour of the insurance lobby points to what
will doubtless be the most important institutional challenge of the years to
come: how much space will be given, in the legal order, to the market and
how much to solidarity. If the ideas I have developed in this book are correct,
then we are no more likely to return to the reign of the law than we
are to see governance by numbers become a permanent fi xture. As we have
seen, contemporary social relations of production have revived the tie of
allegiance, and this is probably an irreversible trend in the new historical
era opening before us. Like every legal bond, the tie of allegiance implies
the existence of a third which guarantees its binding force. For example, in
the agreement made between European companies in the aftermath of the
Rana Plaza disaster, the ILO guarantees the fund these companies set up for
legal and fi nancial solidarity with their Bangladeshi providers. By contrast,
in the French Constitutional Council ’ s ruling on complementary employee
health cover, solidarity between companies was destroyed, and the protection
owing to employees was left to the insurance market.
The principle of solidarity is today the legal order ’ s last bastion against
the market. 9 Hayek, a remarkable, if remarkably limited, thinker understood
this, and declared it bluntly: ‘ Solidarity ’ , he said, ‘ is an instinctual
hangover from the days of tribal society ’ .
10 It must be eradicated in order
for catallaxis to rule on a global scale, that is, ‘ the order generated by the
mutual adjustment of many individual economies on a market ’ .
11 ‘ A Great
Society ’ , he declared, ‘ has no place for “ solidarity ”in the strict sense of the
term, that is, for people coming together around known goals. The two

( Paris , Belin , 2014 ), 238 . For a similar position, see the concept of ‘ anthropo-cosmic

are even incompatible ’ .
12 Since the total market requires the liquidity of

‘ human capital ’in order to establish itself globally, it thereby also requires
the liquidation of all the forms of human ‘ alliance ’implied by solidarity. If,
however, in the footsteps of Karl Polanyi, one says that the markets are ‘ a
useful, but secondary, element in a free society ’ ,
13 things look quite different.
The problem is then to ‘ re-embed ’markets in society, and not to reduce
human life to economic life, nor economic life to the market economy.
A break with capitalism ’ s present form is vital for restoring a balance
between competition and cooperation, which in turn is essential for making
work humane, for the spirit of enterprise, 14 the successful functioning of the
markets in products and services, and the protection of the planet.
The social state was a fi rst attempt to do this, re-embedding the economy
in society. Despite its real successes, it had two weaknesses. The fi rst and
most obvious weakness was that it rested on national legal frameworks.
These have been drastically affected by the elimination of trade barriers and
by the introduction of competition between social, tax and environmental
legislation internationally, as well as by the digital revolution, which has
made it possible to deterritorialise all tasks focusing on signs not things.
The second weakness, which is more rarely noted, is that the social state,
in this similar to Communist regimes, excluded fair organisation of work
from the fi eld of social justice. There was a consensus to the effect that the
organisation of work at its different levels (the individual, the company, the
nation and international trade) was a purely scientifi c and technical issue,
illustrated by Taylorism in the past, and today incarnated in management
by objectives and governance by numbers. What is overlooked here is the
anthropological dimension of work, understood in its broadest and most
concrete sense of human beings ’need to inscribe into their everyday living
environment the mental images which guide their action and collaboration.
Excluding this dimension has had devastating effects not only on the
institution of reason, but also on creativity and respect for the ecumene.
Restoring sustainable institutional frameworks requires regaining a sense of
limits — not only territorial limits, but also limits on the hubris of accumulation
and on humankind ’ s omnipotent treatment of nature — and also a sense
of solidarity: solidarity within and between human communities, and also
ecological solidarity between the human species and its lived environment. 15
This is the broad context within which today ’ s revival of ties of allegiance
and their reshaping of the legal order should be placed. This revival
Conclusion 289

catalyses the decline of the state, and brings back the law of the jungle, as
many regions of the world demonstrate. But this change can also encourage
us to examine the functions of the state afresh. Now that it has lost its
monopoly on organising solidarity, the state ’ s role should be to guarantee
the articulation between national solidarity and solidarity organisations
within civil society and internationally, which are woven through these
networks of allegiance. In the face of private interests, and fi nancial or
religious powers, however, the state must remain the ultimate guarantor,
capable of making the general interest and democracy prevail for everyone.
A fi rst step in this direction would be to restore the principle of democracy,
not only in the political sphere (where it has been discredited by the EU),
but also in the economic sphere, by empowering those who work to have a
say in the goals and meaning of what they do.
