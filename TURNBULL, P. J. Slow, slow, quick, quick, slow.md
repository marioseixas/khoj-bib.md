Slow, slow, quick, quick, slow:
The ‘thick and thin’ of
comparative (statactivist)
research with a European trade
union federation

Peter Turnbull
University of Bristol, UK

Abstract
The greater insight and deeper understanding generated by slow comparative international
research is beyond doubt. However, there are times when researchers need to ‘quicken
up’, most notably when engaged in ‘real-time’ social science that is directly responsive to
policy initiatives by the (supranational) state and/or new business strategies and employment
practices developed by (multi-national) employers. This is a particular challenge
for scholars working with European trade union federations, especially when they are
drawn into political campaigns and/or European policy debates. Such engagement often calls
for a (quick) step from slow (typically qualitative) to fast (predominantly quantitative)
research, using statistics for activism in order to build evidence for representation that can
pass the test of science as well as the test of action. The evidence is necessarily ‘thin’ but
nonetheless sufficient, on occasion, to warrant collective action.

Introduction

The manifesto for ‘slow’ comparative research on work and employment (Almond and
Connolly, 2020) is a public declaration that will no doubt resonate with industrial relations
researchers as both activist-scholars and university employees. Comparative international

research that is little more than a series of flying overseas visits – or what Bate (1997:
1150) derides as ‘jet-plane ethnography’ that produces ‘quick description’ rather than
‘thick description’ – is surely anathema to the activist-scholar who is concerned with ‘not
only what trade unions are, but what they might become, and how’ (Hyman, 2001: 225,
original emphasis). The slow process of access to the ‘common sense’ of relevant actors
demands immersion in the societies, industrial sectors and organizations subject to
theoretical and empirical scrutiny, which clearly favours emancipatory and participatory
action research approaches (Almond and Connolly, 2020: 69–70). In fact, the very act of
incorporating participatory social action into one’s research slows down the research
process (Cancian, 1993: 96). Unfortunately, in the modern-day (neoliberal) university,
going slow runs counter to ‘the current drama of get-rich-quick research activity’ (Stewart
and Mart´ınez Lucio, 2017: 552, original emphasis). As a university employee, regardless
of whether or not one is involved in activism beyond the academy, the pressure to ‘publish
or perish’, and only in ‘high ranking’ journals, has created a highly competitive, often
toxic environment (Smyth, 2017) where the majority of academic staff now claim they
have insufficient time to undertake the research they need to ‘get ahead’ (Times Higher
Education, 04/02/2016 and 08/02/2018). Nonetheless, being a ‘slow professor’ (Berg and
Seeber, 2016) is surely more appealing than a ‘fast food professor’ (Marinetto, 2018:
1015).
The proficiency of slow professors is the culmination of an ‘intimate knowledge of
several thousand concrete cases in their area of expertise’ (Flyvbjerg, 2006: 222), where
the cases in question are not simply countries, sectors and organizations, but everything
from the ‘politics of everyday’ and people’s experiences at work (Courpasson, 2017) to
the ‘politics of opportunity’ and the ability of social movements to transform social
relationships (McAdam et al., 2001). Slow comparativism ‘supports the organic engagement
of researchers within different national contexts’ (Almond and Connolly, 2020:
70) and this context-dependent knowledge and experience, typically accumulated over
many years of idiographic research, is ‘at the very heart of expert activity’ (Flyvbjerg,
2006: 222). That said, there are often times when even slow research has to ‘quicken up’.
In particular, when activist-scholars are engaged in ‘real-time’ social science that is
directly responsive to public issues, they must:

accommodate the schedules of policy-making not the ideal working conditions of scholarship.
This usually means deploying in new contexts knowledge that academics have
already developed, or quickly preparing new analyses of existing data … This sort of real
time social science depends on longer-term research projects already underway and on the
development of social science expertise through careers of scholars who learn about issues
even when they are not immediately the focus of public attention (Calhoun, 2009: 300).

For academics working with European Trade Union Federations (ETUFs), the timing

of when to quicken up is largely determined by the policy-making process, when opportunities
arise to respond to policy proposals at the national and especially the international
level (i.e. the agenda defined by the institutions of the European Union)
(Hyman and Gumbrell-McCormick, 2020: 262). Such opportunities are not simply given

2 European Journal of Industrial Relations 0(0)
and must always be created, but the formal status of ETUFs as social partners in the
European social dialogue presents both on-going opportunities and transformative
moments for activist scholarship. The more challenging question is how to quicken up.
How do we build expert (slow comparative) knowledge and respond to the (real-time)
opportunities for activism that present themselves from time to time? If close contact can
be maintained with our trade union partner(s), founded on trust and a shared commitment
to social transformation, then it is much easier to execute the very tight turns that animate
the rhythm of ‘slow, slow, quick, quick, slow research’ when dancing with our research
partners to the tune of policy makers. With solid (slow) foundations in place, built not only
on trust and commitment but also social scientific expertise, it is possible to generate
evidence that can be used to bolster the representation of workers’ interests in relatively
short (quick) order.
Proponents of participatory action research and other slow qualitative research designs
often downplay the utility of fast(er) quantitative data (e.g. Brook and Darlington, 2013:
240). Such data is typically equated with a positivist (nomothetic) research strategy of
‘thin comparativism’ whereby standardized questions are posed to as many respondents
as possible (e.g. via a questionnaire survey) in order to maximize the comparability of
respondents and establish relationships (correlation) between variables. To be sure, ‘in
divorcing variables from the socio-cultural-political contexts in which their concrete
meaning is interpreted and realized by actors, cross-sectional research often fails to
understand how phenomena or issues are socially constructed’ (Almond and Connolly,
2020: 64). Nonetheless, ‘the use of statistics is part of the repertoire of contention and a
major resource for contemporary mobilizations … to be strong one must ally oneself, and
statistics is a primary cement of such alliances’ (Bruno et al., 2014: 200 and 213).
Statactivism – a portmanteau word used to denote the mobilization of statistics – involves
a denunciation of certain representations of reality (e.g. official data on the violation of
workers’ rights), seizes on elements not often taken into account (e.g. undeclared work)
and creates equivalency among disparate conditions in order to bond together emerging
social categories (e.g. false or bogusly ‘self-employed’ workers). As such, these social
(statistical) categories ‘form the basis for individual and collective identity’ (Porter, 1995:
42).
The generic use of statistics as a tool for struggle, especially for ETUFs when representing
the collective interests of member organizations vis-a-vis the supranational `
state, international employer associations and multi-national employers (MNCs), is
discussed in the following section. The specific use of statistics to ‘quicken up’ slow
research is then demonstrated in relation to policy debates in the European transport
sector, based on more than 20 years of slow comparative research with different transport
sectors of the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF). The deep foundations of
slow research provide a springboard for much quicker, real-time research when the
occasion arises. Moreover, contrary to the assumption that, in theory, ‘one could use
evidence-based principles to promote workers’ interests against those of the management,
but “in theory” is where this idea is likely to be destined to remain’ (Morrell and
Learmonth, 2015: 525), quick research with the ETF has utilized a framework that draws
on such principles to generate ‘evidence for representation’ (EfR) in double-quick time.

Turnbull 3
Using the authority of ‘facts’ without forgetting their statistical construction, the

statactivist can ‘uncover the lies that [management and the state] proffer’ (Bruno et al.,
2014: 208). In a subsequent section, two particular examples of such mendacity are
addressed by way of illustration: first, an assurance by the European Community
Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA) that there was no intention on the part of its members
to increase the number of non-EU nationals on intra-EU regular passenger and ferry
services (CEC, 1999: 17) after the ECSA ‘sank’ a proposed manning Directive (CEC,
1998) designed to protect seafarers’ terms and conditions of employment; and secondly,
claims made by the European Commission that, despite the ‘mis-application of the social
rules in road transport’ (e.g. driving, working and resting time requirements), in the bus
and coach sector at least, existing regulations ‘ensure both fair working conditions for
drivers and fair competition between operators’, such that ‘there does not appear to be a
requirement for any further labour market policies to address these problems’
(Commission Staff Working Document, 2017: 56–7 and 87). Quick research can
promptly dispel such duplicity, although disclosure (denouncing a certain state of reality)
and affirmation (creating equivalency among disparate conditions to cement emerging
social categories) (Bruno et al., 2014: 200) does not necessarily provoke collective action.

Statactivism and evidence for representation with European
trade union federations

The (mis)use of statistics is widely associated with the exercise of power, especially by the
state (Porter, 1995: 43) and in particular the neoliberal state in its quest to foster market
competition (Bruno et al., 2014: 201). Conversely, statistics have long been used to not
only describe the lives of working people, but to demonstrate the relationship between
employment and social conditions with a view to their improvement (e.g. Booth, 1892).
Actors gain power from the data that supports their policy agenda, at the same time as
these data give power to their policy agenda. Power in any social context is not just about
position but also purpose. With the necessary savoir-faire, the statactivist can mobilize
data as a tool for struggle during political fights and, in certain cases, ‘as a means of
emancipation’ (Bruno et al., 2014: 199).
The dual role of statistics is to represent and criticize reality, albeit a synthetic representation
of reality but nonetheless one that can create a shared reading of social and
economic conditions. This is especially important for ETUFs as ‘meta-organizations’ (i.e.
an association of associations) as their members are not individuals (e.g. transport
workers) but collective organizations (e.g. national transport unions) (Hyman and
Gumbrell-McCormick, 2020: 225). If it can be demonstrated that workers in different
European countries share common interests, express shared grievances and experience
similar forms of exploitation, possibly at the hands of the same MNC, then quantifying
these outcomes of a Single European Market ‘necessarily implicates statistical categories
and statactivism, helping to define the subject that serves as receptacle for the desire for
and praxis of emancipation’ (Bruno et al., 2014: 210). Social categories need to be defined
in order to be defended, exploitation needs to be exposed before it can be ended. To be
sure, evidence is not answers – data must always be interpreted in context and there is no

4 European Journal of Industrial Relations 0(0)
guarantee that research evidence will yield a warrant for action – but the simple fact that
‘another number is possible’ creates a shared reading of reality that, at a minimum, will
strengthen the ETUF’s ‘force of argument’ and, on occasion, the ‘argument of force’.
Organizations that have other organizations as members typically lack hierarchical
authority or the power to sanction members. For ETUFs, consensus is therefore sought
through a process of ‘deliberative democracy’ (Hyman and Gumbrell-McCormick, 2020),
because: ‘When policies are adopted deliberately – after sufficient discussion, debate, and
the sifting of reasons and evidence, including from experts – they are more likely to be
policies that people are prepared to live with’ (Keohane et al., 2009: 8, emphasis added).
Collective reasoned reflection is essential to ensure that policies are understood internally
at all levels – from rank-and-file members to national union officials to the permanent
secretariat of the ETUF – and sufficiently robust to withstand the critique of external
interlocutors such as MNCs, European employer associations and the European institutions
(e.g. Commission, Council and Parliament). As recognized social partners, when
ETUFs participate in sector social dialogue committees and the European policy-making
process, they are expected to present robust evidence that can withstand the scrutiny of
peer review and benchmarking against other studies (Smismans, 2015: 22). Indeed, it is
axiomatic that any data that challenges capital(ism) will always be questioned in terms of
rigour and objectivity (Porter, 1995: 5–6; and Stewart and Mart´ınez Lucio, 2017: 540).
Statactivism delivers on both rigour and relevance, generating statistical and other forms
of evidence for representation that challenges EU policies and the business and employment
strategies of employers, in real time, in order to protect and promote the interests
of workers.
The ETF, in common with other ETUFs, has long been embedded in the European
social dialogue and oriented towards the ‘logic of influence’ (Dølvik, 1997) whereby
union organizations adapt their aims and methods to the decision-making processes
through which they seek to represent their members. Transport unions in Europe were
divided on whether the Comite syndicales des transports dans la Communaut ´ e euro- ´
peenne ´ (CSTCE), established in 1958 and commonly known (or derided) as the ‘Brussels
Committee’, should simply service the various Joint Committees established by the
European Commission for joint consultation or whether it should function as an international
trade union federation for transport workers that could organize political
campaigns, support members embroiled in conflict with employers and/or the nation state,
and possibly even coordinate industrial action across member states. Movement in the
latter direction was signalled by the creation of the Fed´ eration Syndicale des Travailleurs ´
des Transports Europeens ´ (FST) in 1996, and most notably by incorporation into the
regional structure of the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) in 1999 as the
ETF. For example, with the support of the ITF, the ETF was able to organize an effective
campaign of political and industrial action by dockworkers against employer and
Commission proposals to liberalize the port services market (Turnbull, 2006b, 2010b). In
hindsight, however, it is evident that mobilization on this scale is rare and might best be
described as a sporadic interruption of the more normal technocratic character of international
and specifically European trade unionism (Gentile, 2016: 122). For other ETF
transport sectors, a more diplomatic approach has prevailed, characterized by social

Turnbull 5
dialogue with European employer associations and lobbying the European institutions (cf.
Hyman and Gumbrell-McCormick, 2020: 268).1
With labour diplomacy comes a more bureaucratic meta-organization, running the risk
that ‘internationalism from above’ might ‘marry efficiency to impotence’, leading to a
suppression of both political alternatives and mobilization capacity (Hyman, 2005: 145).
That said, domination is manifest in control over the means of knowledge production as
well as material production, and evidence (the force of argument) invariably comes before
action (the argument of force). Through statactivism, evidence can establish the foundations
if not the focus for action. Mobilizations take place around social indicators (e.g.
real wage levels, the prevalence of zero hours contracts, accident and injury rates, etc.),
which requires both an ‘authority of facts’ and the utilization of politically accountable
forms of knowledge. Such knowledge, as depicted in Figure 1, might be used to make
public and legitimate (or illegitimate) a common practice not yet brought to light, to
deconstruct and de-legitimize existing statistical indicators, or to institutionalize new
social categories. For example, the extensive hiring of pilots on ‘self-employment’
contracts by several low-cost airlines, most notably Ryanair (Harvey and Turnbull,
2015, 2020), was not widely appreciated prior to the publication of a report commissioned
by the European Cockpit Association that involved national case studies and a survey of
more than 6600 European pilots (Jorens et al., 2015).2 Initially, the Commission referred
to this practice as a new ‘business model’ but eventually acknowledged that such hiring
practices constitute a form of ‘bogus’ or ‘false self-employment’ (Turnbull, 2020).
The four different types of knowledge depicted in Figure 1 are interdependent and
thereby equally important for effective representation. While the mantra of evidenceFigure

6 European Journal of Industrial Relations 0(0)
based policy-making is ‘what works’, the normative foundation of EfR is ‘what’s right’
(i.e. socially just). Armed with knowledge for understanding, the statactivist can ‘do the
research right’ (i.e. according to the rigours of social scientific methods) as ‘it requires
institutional or personal credibility even to produce impersonal numbers’ (Porter, 1995:
214). More importantly, the power of social scientific evidence resides not only in more
‘objective’ empirical data but ‘knowledge for understanding’. Theoretical interventions –
‘deploying in new contexts knowledge that academics have already developed’ (Calhoun,
2009: 300) – can function as a form of political practice precisely because problems are
always in need of a theoretical explanation as well as a practical solution. Hence, the
importance of combining social scientific evidence with sector-specific (contextdependent)
evidence in order to translate this knowledge into action.
Crucially, this is not a unidirectional diffusion of ‘expert knowledge’ – or what
Burawoy (2005: 10–11) labels ‘professional sociology’ – rather a dialectic interaction of
mutual education. EfR involves a critical engagement between the researcher and the
research partner, the co-production of research with as opposed to research on or for. EfR
is critical in the sense of avoiding the subordination of academic work to the immediate
interests and demands of political organizations such as ETUFs – a danger inherent to
what Burawoy (2005: 9–11) has classified as ‘policy sociology’. By retaining the independence
needed for the proper development of scholarly reflection, the statactivist can
proactively engage in support of workers’struggles for democracy, equality, decent work,
fair pay, etc. Critical engagement ‘expands the role of the sociologist into the furnace of
action itself and the grounding of ideas within the movement itself’ (Lambert, 2008: 98,
original emphasis). Doing things right (the test of science) is the foundation for doing the
right thing (the test of action).
Working with ETUFs, the statactivist is engaged with an expert community that
understands the significance of statistical significance, given that the typical professional
international trade union official today is a graduate with language skills who, having
spent some time as a researcher in a national labour movement, has progressed to an
international federation (Hyman, 2005: 147). Equally important, as diplomats engaged in
political lobbying and social dialogue with European employer associations, the modernday
secretariats of ETUFs are well-versed in dealing with a variety of different stakeholders.
They appreciate the importance of understanding the interests of employers and
policymakers if they are to generate legitimate knowledge in the eyes of external interlocutors,
especially as these stakeholders have the power to make certain ideas (appear)
universal (e.g. ‘freedom of access’ to a single market or what constitutes‘fair competition’
and a ‘level playing field’) (ETF, 2019: 15). The appeal of numbers is especially
compelling for bureaucratic officials of the European Commission, who lack the mandate
of a popular election: ‘A decision made by the numbers … has at least the appearance of
being fair and impersonal’ (Porter, 1995: 8). EfR thereby generates both statistical and
practical confidence in a ‘shared reading’ of the research evidence, making public issues
out of private problems in accordance with the precepts of ‘organic public sociology’
(Burawoy, 2005: 7–9). At a minimum, stakeholders must acknowledge that workers have
a case and there is a case to answer.

Turnbull 7
Knowledge for framing is also central to EfR, as international solidarity ultimately

rests on ‘an active strategy by union leaders and activists to enhance knowledge, understanding
and identification of common interests cross-nationally’ (Hyman, 2005: 149).
Variously described as ‘organic intellectuals’ or ‘political entrepreneurs’ who possess ‘the
vision to explore transnational strategies and the leadership skills to convince their
constituency’ (Greer and Hauptmeier, 2008: 80), this is the group of collaborators ‘who
can take the lead in co-analysis, who are motivated to appropriate the project, and who
engage in some sort of critical reflexivity and conceptual production upon their own
practices’ (Arribas Lozano, 2018: 106). Meta-organizations need to connect the secretariat
of the federation to the rank-and-file members of affiliated unions, via union officials
and activists who not only draw on shared trade union identities and familiar ideas about
union action, but who move cognitively and physically outside their spatial origins and
are open to new repertoires of contention. They continue to be linked to national and local
place and the social networks that inhabit that space, but they frame knowledge (research
evidence) as not simply a threat but an opportunity to externalize conflict and forge new
and/or stronger alliances with their counterparts in other countries (Tarrow, 2005). As
‘practical theorists’, union officials engage with activist-scholars in a form of ‘critical
sociology’ (Burawoy, 2005: 10–11) that reflects on the normative as well as the descriptive
foundations of the research, on political as well as academic accountability (i.e.
the ‘test of action’ as well as the ‘test of science’), on ‘what matters’ (to the workers) as
well as ‘what’s interesting’ (to the researcher).
EfR offers a way for comparative industrial relations researchers to reconcile the longstanding
dilemma of how to combine idiographic and nomothetic research methods (cf.
Hyman, 2001). The co-production of knowledge and the combination of different forms
of knowledge depicted in Figure 1 is clearly attuned to slow (idiographic) research,
building long-term relationships with the ETUF and its members, engaging with and
understanding the interests of different stakeholders, and learning about relevant issues
even when they are not at the top of the policy agenda. In this way, researchers come to
appreciate that interrelationships between different societal elements renders the experience
of every national trade union movement (more or less) unique. But without
common variables, there is only difference. Thus, as Hyman (2001: 210) notes, ‘Formulating
and “testing” explanatory generalizations are necessary, and reciprocally
conditioning, elements in comparative research. In the process, we may attain a deeper
and more sensitive understanding of difference in similarity and similarity in difference’.
In this regard, EfR is equally well-suited to faster (nomothetic) approaches. For
example, questionnaires can be readily and rapidly developed and distributed with the
assistance of both the ETUF’s secretariat and national union officials/activists. More
importantly, through co-production of the questionnaire, survey questions will ‘speak to’
respondents and enable the ETUF and its affiliates to ‘speak for’ their respective
members: questionnaires can encourage respondents to express their interests, articulate
personal claims and reflect on shared grievances, which in turn can be presented as a
collective and coherent political claim. Even if fast questionnaire survey research does
nothing more than record empirical events and establish correlation between variables,
this might be sufficient to put workers’ interests (the case to answer) on the policy agenda.

With EfR, the statactivist can go much further, drawing on different forms of knowledge
to look beyond the observable and investigate the causal mechanisms behind the empirical
world of quantifiable events. In the world of international transport, where both
capital and labour are highly mobile, these mechanisms are played out in a Single
European Market that allows capital to exploit labour via regulatory ‘spaces of exception’
(Lillie, 2010) and digital platforms that not only give firms access to more data but also a
dominant market position and potential control over the rules of what is supposed to be a
‘level playing field’ for competition (Srnicek, 2017: 47).

Lies, damned lies and statactivism

Slow, slow comparativism – ports, civil aviation and … maritime

Slow research on the CSTCE began in 1995, prior to the creation of the FST, as part of a 3-
year project on the comparative economic performance of European ports (Barton and
Turnbull, 2002). At the time, the CSTCE/FST was a rather peripheral player on the
waterfront as there was no European sector social dialogue committee for port transport
and many dockworker trade unions objected to making financial contributions to what
they regarded as an ineffective European Comite´, especially when they were active in the
ITF. However, the policy context changed dramatically in 2000 when the ETF received a
document from the European Commission with a series of questions that were clearly
designed to ‘test the water’ for plans to liberalize the port services market. The author was
asked to write a response for the Dockers’ Section of the ETF, to be submitted to the
Commission following a review of the document by affiliated dockworker trade unions.
Research with the ETF continued throughout the ensuing ‘war on Europe’s waterfront’
(Turnbull, 2006b), including subsequent participation as an official delegate of the ETF at
a series of six workshops organized by the Commission to determine future EU ports
policy (Turnbull, 2010b). The latter involved quickly drafting responsesin the name of the
ETF to Commission position papers issued less than 10 days before each workshop.
Around this time, attention turned to a participatory action research project with the
Civil Aviation Section of the ETF as part of a long-term study of the Single European
Aviation Market (SEAM) and ‘social dumping’ by low-cost airlines (Turnbull, 2010a).
This research involved a combination of case studies and questionnaire surveys of
aviation workers (Harvey and Turnbull, 2012, 2014), culminating in a 2-day workshop for
all stakeholders3 and a joint declaration by the social partners on the threats posed by
‘flags of convenience’ (FoCs). Registering a ship in a more ‘convenient’ country in order
to avoid taxes and labour standards in the owner’s country is a long-standing and
widespread practice in the maritime industry (Lillie, 2010) and was now a feature of the
SEAM. For the ETF and the Association of European Airlines, at issue was a low-cost
business model that distorted social conditions and competition, posing a threat to
‘comparatively decent employment’ in European civil aviation: the social partners feared
a similar fate to shipping, where ‘the past permissive attitude towards the use of flags of
convenience has been devastating to industry and employment alike’.
4 For example, at the
turn of the millennium, non-EU nationals constituted only 2–3 per cent of the crew onTurnbull
9
board regular short-sea services between EU member states and most services were
carried out by ships under member states’ flags; a decade later, around 1-in-5 crew were
hired from third countries (ECORYS, 2009: v).
Although the maritime industry was not the immediate focus of research with the ETF,
it was still possible, if not inevitable, to learn indirectly about shipping as a result of the
emergence of FoCs in civil aviation and directly as a consequence of the close cooperation
between maritime and dockworker trade unions within the ITF and ETF. In 2010, the ETF
launched a campaign for ‘Fair and Safe Ferries for All’ (Umney, 2012) combining portbased
vessel inspection (supported by national dockworker trade unions) and political
lobbying for a Directive that would make the ITF’s ‘Athens Policy’ a reality. With similar
wording to the Commission’s proposed Common Policy on Manning of Regular Passenger
and Ferry Services (CEC, 1998), which was vehemently opposed and ultimately
scuppered by the ECSA in 2004, the ITF’s Athens Policy states that: ‘the crews of vessels
engaged in European ferry trades, including non-European vessels, shall be covered by
European conditions of employment which are regulated through national collective
bargaining agreements held by the appropriate ITF European affiliates’.
5 When the
Political Secretary of the ETF Dockers’ Section transferred to the Maritime Section, we
entered into correspondence on how to bring new (statistical) evidence to bear on FoCs
and social dumping, in particular with respect to: ‘the terms and conditions applied to
crew members on-board ships trading between European countries and then prolonging
their trade to non-European Southern Mediterranean countries’ (email from the ETF, 18
September 2012).

Quick statactivism – short-sea shipping

Accurate and comparable data on seafarers is scarce (EC, 2020: 11), especially when
shipping lines operate under a FoC in the ‘spaces of exception’ (Lillie, 2010) on routes
between EU and non-EU countries, where seafarers ‘fall between the cracks’ (EC, 2020:
18) or ‘loopholes’ in existing EU regulations (ETF, 2019: 3) and policy makers and other
stakeholders are ‘deprived of key information that would normally be used to identify
problems’ (EC, 2020: 11). Shipping lines are of course in full possession of the necessary
evidence, but they use their considerable financial, technical and other resources to ‘set an
agenda that corresponds to their needs’ (EC, 2020: 17), which includes with-holding
information on crewing and labour costs (EC, 2020: 14). For its part, the ETF has limited
internal research capacity6 and is therefore reliant on national unions and the commitment
of activist-scholars who can generate the necessary (statistical) evidence for representation.
To this end, as part of its work programme for 2013–17, it was agreed with the
ETF’s Maritime Transport Section (MTS) to undertake a 5-month (quick) research project
in order to:

1. identify all ferry routes and vessels in the western Mediterranean;
2. determine whether terms and conditions of the crew differ depending on the
nationalities of seafarers; and

3. analyse the recurrent practice of reflagging to cheaper flags with less stringent
conditions.

Data on shipping is available from a variety of sources, creating the potential for new

analysis of existing data. The annual market report published by Shippax provides a
comprehensive list of all cruise, ferry, ro-ro and high-speed vessel trading worldwide.7
From this database it was possible to identify all short-sea services in the western
Mediterranean and for each vessel record the operator(s), flag and flag changes from 2003
onwards. These data were combined with and cross-checked against Sea-web, an online
database of currently more than 200,000 vessels that is continuously updated.8 Access to
the Sea-web database was secured via the Dockers’ Secretary of the ITF and involved
initial training to use the database at the Federation’s HQ in London. Although our main
concern was to extract data on vessels trading between EU member states and then
extending their services to the Maghreb countries, we also included island cabotage as a
‘control group’ as these vessels are known to be flagged and operated by EU member
states and crewed predominantly by EU seafarers. This yielded a total population of 116
vessels sailing from either France, Italy or Spain to non-EU countries and 227 vessels on
island cabotage (Thomas and Turnbull, 2021).
As expected, on island cabotage almost all the vessels (96%) sailed under their national
flag. In contrast, on ferry routes to non-EU countries there were 33 different operators
under 59 registered owners, with almost 30% sailing under a FoC. There was clear
evidence of flagging out, as less than a third of the vessels flew the flag of France, Italy or
Spain and yet more than 40% of vessels were under French, Italian or Spanish ownership.
Moreover, between 2003 and 2012, almost 1-in-5 vessels had re-registered under a more
convenient flag, allowing the operator to employ seafarers on inferior terms and conditions
of employment. These data exposed the fallacy of the ECSA’s earlier claim that its
members had no intention of flagging out. Amongst the group of vessels flying a FoC, an
average of six vessels per annum changed flag, just one of several indicators of ‘regime
shopping’ in an open market.
In order to demonstrate that conditions on-board FoC vessels are inferior when
compared to EU-flagged vessels, the data from Shippax and Sea-web was married to
information collated by Equasis9 on the detention and deficiencies of vessels recorded by
the Paris MoU on Port State Control.10 The detention of a vessel is clearly an objective
measure: a vessel has either been allowed to sail following an inspection or detained
because of technical deficiencies (e.g. structural integrity of the vessel, equipment,
maintenance, etc.) and/or human element deficiencies, whether in relation to the crew (e.g.
competency and training standards) or conditions on-board (e.g. hygiene, living accommodation,
medical equipment, etc.). While there was no statistically significant
difference in the average number of detentions per vessel between FoCs and other flags, as
documented in Table 1, the average number of deficiencies was significantly higher on
FoC vessels. Moreover, recorded deficiencies are known to be just the ‘tip of the iceberg’
as vessel inspectors often lack the time, resources and sometimes the competencies
needed to detect human element deficiencies (Bloor and Sampson, 2009: 715).

Turnbull 11
When these initial results were presented to the MTS Steering Committee established

to co-produce the research, attention focused on incomplete crew data, both in terms of the
nationality of seafarers and whether they were covered either by an EU collective
agreement, the ITF-IMEC (International Maritime Employers’ Council) collective
agreement that sets out seafarers’ wages and working conditions on board FoC vessels in
international trade, or no legally binding collective agreement. It was therefore agreed to
design a questionnaire that national union officials, activists and vessel inspectors would
complete, covering every vessel on EU to non-EU routes and a representative sample of
vessels on island cabotage. For each vessel, data was requested on crew composition and
nationalities, compliance with the ITF’s standard manning policy and other international
regulations, deficiencies (as per the Paris MoU) and the (in)effectiveness of recording/
reporting procedures, coverage of collective bargaining agreements (if any), and terms
and conditions on-board benchmarked against the ITF-IMEC collective agreement. The
statistical results were once again significant – FoC vessels fell well short of the standards
on EU-flagged vessels – but far from complete. While questionnaire data was returned for
almost every vessel on island cabotage, for trades to non-EU countries questionnaires
were returned for 79% of vessels calling at Italian ports, 73% of vessels calling at Spanish
ports, and only 17% of vessels calling at French ports. Moreover, returned questionnaires
were often incomplete, with missing responses to specific questions.
The absence of statistical data highlighted the need for further action, not simply the
collection of more systematic evidence for representation to ensure a shared reading of
reality based on the authority of comprehensive facts, but targeted vessel inspection and
union organizing. To this end, the next stage of statactivism involved importing the data
into a live Excel file that could be regularly updated when vessels changed flag, hired a
different crew of convenience, called at different ports, etc. Variables were colour coded to
enable union officials, activists and vessel inspectors to readily identify the shipping lines
and/or vessels with non-EU crews, those with a preponderance of previous detentions and
deficiencies, or no collective agreement. By also colour coding the ports where these
vessels called most often, inspection/union organizing could then be targeted at the ‘worst
offenders’, albeit only in those ports where dockworkers are both willing and able to
refuse to un/load a vessel until deficiencies are rectified and demands are satisfied.

Although the data was used to support political action at the supranational level –

specifically the removal of various exemptions in EU secondary legislation that excluded
certain seafarers from their scope11 – industrial action at the national level was muted. The
ETF had previously called for ‘industrial actions with a view to support our legitimate
political demands’ (Philippe Alfonso, Political Secretary, MTS News Online, 20 September
2010), but the MTS Steering Committee made it clear that it would be left to ‘individual
unions to look at industrial actions’ (MTS Minutes, June 2012). As a result, the metaorganizational
politics of the ETF and ITF, specifically long-standing differences between
national dockworker unions (Gentile, 2016), effectively curtailed the option of port-based
inspection backed by dockworkers. The main dockworker trade unions in France
(Fed´ eration nationale des ports et docks ´ ) and Spain (Coordinadora) are not affiliated to the
ETF. Dockworkers in Italy are affiliated to the ETF, but the dockworkers’ cooperatives
(compagnie portuale) are now private companies, and their workforce is consequently more
vulnerable to dismissal in the event of (secondary) industrial action. Union organization in
the Maghreb ports is much weaker, but more importantly any coordinated union action
targeting vessels sailing between EU and non-EU countries falls under the remit of the ITF’s
Fair Practices Committee, a joint committee of seafarers’ and dockers’ unions that runs the
ITF campaign against FoCs. The ITF had already made it clear that, at the height of the Arab
Spring, it was ‘not appropriate’ to involve ITF Inspectors and union representatives from
the Maghreb countries in the questionnaire survey of vessels sailing between EU and nonEU
countries (email from ITF Maritime Section, 31 January 2013). It may be axiomatic that
when we describe we prescribe, but prescription is not permission – making an issue more
visible does not necessarily make industrial action any more viable.

Quick statactivism – long-distance bus and coaches

Ports are places where land and sea transport intersect. As with shipping, knowledge of
the road transport sector was accumulated over the years by osmosis. Then, in 2009, a
project to promote social dialogue in the ports of Bulgaria and Romania (Turnbull,
2006a), jointly funded by the International Labour Organization and European Commission,
was extended to include road haulage. Research with road transport unions
continued with a project to promote the employment of women in the transport sector
(Turnbull, 2013) and participation in the ETF’s Education for Valuable Employment
(EVE) project, led by the Political Secretary of the Road Transport Section (RTS).12 When
policymakers proposed changes to existing EU driving and rest time regulations as part of
the first Mobility Package (MP1)13 in May 2017, the ETF was already in the process of
collecting evidence for road haulage (ETF, 2018). It was agreed to gather comparable
evidence for drivers engaged in international bus and coach services, a sub-sector that the
Commission characterised as under-performing, with a ‘patchwork of rules’ that creates‘a
high administrative burden’ and restrictions on market access that ‘limit competition
between operators and against other modes’ (EC, 2017: 3). The ETF’s starting point, in
contrast, was not the regulatory burden or ‘red tape’ (reglementation ´ ) that Jean-Claude
Junker’s Commission was committed to reducing (EC, 2014: 2), rather poor enforcement
of existing rules (regulation ´ ). Statistics were required to demonstrate this point.

Turnbull 13
Member states are required to organize a system of appropriate and regular vehicle checks

for all categories of road transport (Directive 2006/22/EC, Art.2). States provide detailed
statistics on controls of compliance (e.g. number of vehicles checked at the roadside and at
company premises) but information on the implementation of the Road Transport Working
Time Directive (2002/15/EC), which lays down the rules on the organization of the working
time of mobile workers, is patchy at best. For the review period 2015–16, for example, seven
member states failed to submit a report and only seven member states provided detailed
statistics on controls and their outcomes. Member states are also obliged to undertake not less
than six one-week concerted roadside checks per year with at least one other member state.
Again, not all member states provide information on coordinated checks and only 15 states
met the required number of checks during the relevant review period for the ETF project
(Commission Staff Working Document, 2018: 13).
Although cross-border coordination and cooperation is the sine qua non for enforcement
in international transport, there is no pan-European road transport agency to
promote uniform standards and enforcement (unlike, for example, the European Union
Aviation Safety Agency). However, coordinated checks are organized by EuroControle ˆ
Route (ECR), a voluntary cooperation of European transport inspection services working
together to improve road safety, sustainability, fair competition and labour conditions in
road transport through activities related to compliance with existing regulations.14 ECR
targets particular offences (e.g. tachograph fraud/manipulation) or type of vehicles (e.g.
holiday buses) during coordinated inspection weeks. Analysis of these data revealed that
it is only when inspectors target drivers’ hours that the difference between a ‘regular’ and
‘target’ week is statistically significant, as documented in Table 2. Further calculations
based on ECR data established that, across the EU, around 15–20% of controlled longdistance
buses, on average, record an offence each year. Analysis of all bus and coach

offences between 2012 and 2016 revealed that drivers’ hours constituted the largest
number of offences each year (around 25%), with the exception of 2015 when tachograph
offences were most frequently recorded.
As the tachograph is the most effective way to enforce drivers’ hours, these two
concerns are closely related. However, proposals for the utilization of advanced vehicle
technology would have to wait for Mobility Package 3 (MP3), to be published in May
2018. The ETF wanted (quick) data before the publication of MP3 in order to demonstrate
the routine violation of driving and rest time regulations and to highlight the structural
problems created by opening the market. Mobility Package 2 (MP2), published in
November 2017, proposed further measures to open access to the bus and coach market, a
sector already dominated by just a handful of ‘lean platforms’ (Srnicek, 2017: 49–50)
such as FlixBus. These companies rely not only on market access (e.g. liberalization of the
German bus market in 2013 that opened the roads to FlixBus) but also network effects:
‘the more numerous the users who use the platform, the more valuable that platform
becomes for everyone else … [resulting in] … a natural tendency towards monopolisation’
(Srnicek, 2017: 45). Witness the merger of FlixBus and MeinFernbus, which
created a company with a domestic market share of over 70%. Further consolidation –
with megabus, Postbus and Eurolines – resulted in a company not only with a dominant
position in Germany (over 90% of the market) but by far the largest route network across
Europe and, most recently, expansion into the US market. The driver of market domination
is low prices (e.g. FlixBus offered EUR€1 tickets for its new international services
announced in December 2015), made possible by sub-contracting all services to ‘partner’
bus companies. FlixBus controls the platform, providing the administration and permissions
required to operate long-distance and international services, but the company
neither owns any coaches nor employs any drivers.
During initial meetings of the RTS Steering Committee established to oversee the project,
as well as focus group meetings with activist-drivers from Belgium and the Netherlands, it
was clear that sub-contracting was associated with sub-standard terms and conditions of
employment and routine violation of driving and rest time regulations. Notwithstanding the
veracity of insights proffered by union officials and activists on this new social category of
drivers, it is important to recognize that when stakeholders represent their members’ interests
to the Commission, they are advised that ‘it is important to distinguish evidence from
opinions’ (EC, 2009: 20). An online questionnaire survey was therefore developed, focussing
on objective (time-based) measures for driving, breaks and daily/weekly rest, in accordance
with Directive 2002/15/EC, as well as any work activities performed during designated rest
periods. As drivers experience very different levels of remuneration, working time and work
intensity during high (summer) and low (winter) seasons, which tends to be exacerbated for
sub-contractors, data was sought for different times of the year and different categories of
drivers. Non-probability (purposive) sampling was used to target unionized drivers via
national transport unions and non-union drivers via online forums where participants log-on
to ‘compare notes’ on different operators. The survey returned 696 responses (630 men and
66 women), from 17 EU member states.15 More than a third of the total sample were nonunion
members. Most respondents were directly employed by either operators or‘partner’ bus

Turnbull 15
companies (sub-contractors), and 1-in-7 respondents were hired via an agency or on a shortterm
contract (typically 6–12 months).16
There was clear evidence of both low pay and variable pay. Drivers were paid as little as
EUR€11 per hour and the average (mode) monthly salary during the low season was
EUR€1500–1999 compared to EUR€2000–2500 in the high season. The proportion of
drivers earning less than EUR€1500 per month more than doubled during the low season
(from 1-in-8 drivers to more than 1-in-4). More than 60% of drivers received an irregular
monthly salary, principally as a result of pay per hours driving (over 28% of the sample) or per
hours worked (over 47%). One indication of the absence of ‘red tape’ was the finding that
more than 1-in-10 drivers (over 12%) did not receive a detailed pay slip each month. These
drivers were more likely to be hired via an agency and were less likely to receive a range of
benefits such as health care insurance, sick pay and training, as documented in Table 3.
Questions on driving and rest times were designed to support the ETF’s campaign to
prevent any changes that might further intensify work and to strengthen the Federation’s
call for the more rapid introduction of smart (tamper-proof) digital tachographs. Respondents
were asked how often their daily resting time was reduced to less than 11 hours
(almost 44% replied ‘frequently’ and a further 48% said ‘occasionally’) and how often
they were unable to take their full weekly rest entitlement (1-in-4 replied ‘frequently’ and
a further 39% said ‘occasionally’). Table 4 lists the activities that drivers are expected to
perform during what should be their rest time. Agency/temporary drivers were

parking space for the bus/coach (p < .05), and cleaning the bus/coach (p < .05).
The evidence co-produced with the ETF demonstrated that, in clear violation of
European driving and rest time regulations, international bus and coach drivers routinely
work excessive hours, much of this time is unrecorded and certainly unremunerated, and
their work is intensified as a result of additional (typically unpaid) activities that systematically
eat into their daily and weekly rest time. The report based on the project
(Turnbull, 2018) was published by the ETF in April 2018 and officially launched at a
meeting of the European Parliament the following month to coincide with the final
Mobility Package (MP3). Under the ordinary legislative (co-decision) procedure, the ETF
relies on national transport unions to lobby European Council members, whereas the
Federation can address MEPs both directly and indirectly (via national unions) to build a
network of support across different political groups in the European Parliament that crosscut
national party lines. The success of this political (legislative) campaign was signalled
by the ‘road not travelled’ (i.e. stalling many of the proposals most likely to have a
particularly adverse impact on drivers’ terms and conditions of employment), and by
expediting the more widespread introduction of the latest generation of tachographs. The
smart tacho automatically registers the vehicle every 3 hours of accumulated driving time
as well as the location of passenger pick-up/drop-off. The latter is considered by law to be
working time, but our data clearly demonstrated that these and other activities are often
not remunerated. The ETF expects the latest EU Regulation (2020/1054) on maximum
daily and weekly driving times, minimum breaks and weekly rest periods to curb the
practice of paying drivers only for their driving time rather than their entire working
activity.

Conclusion

Comparative industrial relations research is an iterative process driven not only by the
confrontation between idiographic and nomothetic methods (Hyman, 2001) but also the
(temporal) interaction between slow and fast research. In the neoliberal university, all
academic staff are now expected to ‘quicken up’, but for activist-scholars working with
the labour movement a ‘quickstep’ (fast research) that passes the test of action as well as
the test of science is only possible when founded on many years of slow research. The
latter ensures a deep understanding of industrial relations in different countries, sectors
and workplaces, access to key informants, and the ability to act quickly by mobilizing
the necessary intellectual, human and data resources when opportunities arise.
No doubt cynics might still ask what fast research adds to our existing knowledge of
industrial relations in Europe? After all, neither project reported here revealed anything
about the working lives of seafarers and drivers that the ETF and national transport unions
were not already aware of. Except that this was no longer a matter of ‘opinion’ but rather
statistically significant evidence – ‘facts that stick’ – and the evidence pointed to systemic
features (or more accurately failures) of the market that drive down workers’ terms and
conditions of employment. The playing field was not level, competition was not fair.

Turnbull 17
Shipping lines exploited spaces of exception in order to exploit seafarers. Lean platforms
exploited their monopoly power in order to exploit drivers. Slower ethnographic research
with individual seafarers and drivers would no doubt generate ‘thicker’ and more
compelling stories of the hardships of their daily working lives, based on their own
personal experiences. Except that now they know their experience is shared by many
others, and sharing that knowledge makes them part of a much larger community of
knowing. To be sure, the comparison might be necessarily ‘thin’, but it can still prove
sufficient to cement new social categories with a different interpretation of the present and
vision for the future.
Statactivism involves the (re)interpretation of existing data as well as the collection of
new evidence for representation, which is all the more telling when variables are based on
widely recognized measures such as technical or human element deficiencies in shipping or
driving and rest times in road passenger transport. Clearly, it is not sufficient simply to
establish a statistically significant relationship between the flag of a vessel sailing in
European waters and seafarers’ terms and conditions of employment, or the systematic
under-recording of driving time on European roads and undeclared work during the official
rest periods of bus and coach drivers. Nonetheless, correlation – the case to answer – cannot
simply be discounted. This is especially important for ETUFs in terms of political engagement
with supranational institutions, as demonstrated by legislative (in)action when
research data is used to bolster the force of argument. In contrast, it is far more problematic
for ETUFs, as meta-organizations, to use aggregate data to persuade member unions to
engage in a particular course of national political and/or industrial action.
Fast(er) research is evidently more attuned to generalization across countries and
social categories, whereas slow(er) research is more attuned to the variegated impact of
global neoliberalism and a holistic understanding of a particular time and place
(Almond and Connolly, 2020: 65–6). EfR is a way to resolve this temporal and
methodological dilemma: by drawing on a variety of knowledge (Figure 1), it is equally
well-suited to fast(er) or slow(er) research. Consequently, EfR offers recourse in those
‘moments of confrontation between a general research problematic on one hand, and
what occurs at a local level on the other’, especially in the moments of real-time social
science when researchers need to ‘find a means of dancing between the requirement for
some degree of meta-comparability (a thematic unity across countries) and societal
specifics at a more granular level’ (Almond and Connolly, 2020: 67). As comparative
international scholars, maybe we should all learn to dance slow, slow, quick, quick,
slow.
