Abstract

This paper shows that the international harmonization of commercial legal rules and
commercial legal standards in Latin America have been the result of very specific legal and
economic country-specific factors. The paper proposes that international legal harmonization
within a regional bloc of countries is a function of the convergence of three broad
conditions: 1 first, the a priori international country-to-country compatibility in the form Ž .
and scope of their legal rules applied to domestic commercial transactions; 2 the emer- Ž .
gence and growth of intra-sectoral international markets supported by foreign direct
investment; and 3 the emergence and growth of domestic trade-related industries seeking Ž .
compatible legal rules in their exporting markets abroad. A jurimetric model is introduced
showing that the drive to seek international legal harmonization has been explained by these
specific economic and legal domestic factors.  2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

1. Introduction

Recent literature on legal and economic regional integration has stressed the
key role of emerging trading blocs in shaping the world economy of the 20th-century
Davey et al., 1995 . Economic trends Ž .
such as rapid changes in applied
research, technology, capital flows and trade patterns
have all assumed an
enhanced importance in fostering economic growth. According to Abramovitz
Ž . 1989 , the extent to which a country that is technologically behind a leader is able
to catch up will depend in part on its social capability to absorb advanced
technologies Abramovitz, 1989 . Nelson and Wright 1992 and Porter 1985 state Ž . Ž. Ž.
that the main factors fostering the social capability for technological improvement
include a strong research and development R & D sector, higher educational Ž .
institutions satisfying the demand for scientists and engineers emanating from
emerging markets, and competitive environments acting as disciplinary factors for
firms Schumpeter, 1950; Porter, 1985; Rosenberg, 1985; Nelson and Wright, 1992 . Ž .
None of these publications, however, discuss in depth the required legal changes
needed to foster competitive environments and enhance the capabilities to absorb
technologies.
Developing nations are currently facing a unique opportunity created by global
free trade, the continuous decline in transportation and communication costs
coupled with the unprecedented availability of generic applied knowledge, and the
expanding flows of international financial investments. However, throughout their
history, many of these countries have lacked the institutional capability to create or
absorb the applied knowledge aforementioned Buscaglia, 1993 . Ž .
The main purpose of the analysis advanced in this paper is to explain how the
limited international harmonization of commercial legal rules and commercial
legal standards in Latin America has been the result of specific domestic legal and
economic factors. This paper shows that the international legal harmonization is a
function of the convergence of three broad conditions: 1 the a priori international Ž .
country-to-country compatibility in the form and scope of their legal rules applied
to domestic commercial transactions; 2 the emergence and growth of intra Ž .
sectoral international markets supported by foreign direct investment; and 3 the Ž .
emergence and growth of domestic trade-related industries seeking compatible
legal rules in their exporting markets abroad. Specifically, the compatibility in the
evolutionary natures of two or more economic and legal systems will be introduced
as a factor that will affect the desirability and feasibility of international legal
integrations. Moreover, a jurimetric model is introduced in Section 3 proving that
the drive to seek international legal harmonization in Latin America is explained
by well-specified economic and legal factors
In Section 2, this paper will describe the main drives toward legal integration
within South America during the 19th and 20th centuries. A jurimetric analysis
follows in Section 3 revealing the connections between legal integration and
economic structures. Section 4 offers a conclusion of our analysis.

2. Theory and its application: an account of the international legal harmonization
experience in Latin America

Most of the civil law countries in Latin America achieved their independence in
the nineteenth century and, one after the other, adopted codified law within the
Roman and Germanic tradition. Much of the codification observed in Latin
American legal history until the early 20th century was the product of transplanting
civil, commercial and penal codes from Europe to the different countries in the
region Watson, 1983 . During the period from 1825 to 1890, substantive and Ž .
procedural civil, commercial and criminal codes were all transplanted from the
French Codification, with few adaptations, to the South American scene Merry- Ž
man, 1985a . For example, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, .
Peru and Venezuela adopted the Napoleonic Code even though they had never
been under French territorial control. The impact of the American Constitution on
Latin American public law is another example of a transplant Merryman, 1985b . Ž .
As a result, most Latin American legal systems started from the same evolutionary
base.1
The complexity of a legal system is the product of its evolution. This complexity
is defined in terms of the breadth of socio-economic interactions that a legal
system is capable of addressing. As an economic structure evolves from its agrarian
origin to a more diversified economic structure, the legal system would tend to
branch out from its evolutionary base in order to address the higher diversity of
economic interactions. In this respect, if a legal system were not subject to
substantive changes in its private law, a possible explanation is that its economic
structure may not have experienced much change compared to its agrarian beginnings
i.e., new economic sectors or changes in the relative importance of these Ž
.Ž . 2 sectors Clagett, 1952 . In fact, this economic evolution provides an explanation
of why those legal systems in which only mild changes in the sectoral structure of
their GDP have occurred and where the agricultural sector still prevails such as Ž
Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru address substantive and procedural problems of .
commercial law in strikingly similar ways and without showing much evolution
Ž . 3 relative to their initial legal structures Karst, 1966; de Robertis, 1988 . In fact,
within countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay one can observe that present
economic structures are not too different from the ones observed at the time when
the early 19th century transplants occurred. In short, the complexity in the
evolution of private law is also explained by the complexity in the development of

1
Specifically, the compatibility in the evolutionary natures of two or more legal systems will be
introduced as a factor that will affect the need and feasibility of legal integrations. 2
One can observe that, within the volatile political history of the region, agrarian economies’ public
laws e.g. constitutional or labor law frameworks were subject to drastic changes regardless of the stage Ž .
of development. One can also observe that private law, however, in the form of civil and commercial
codes, have experienced only minor changes since their inception. 3
Karst points at these similarities found among the legal systems of Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru
without addressing its possible causes.

its economic structure. In this context, one can claim that the economic structures
Ž . i.e., composition and relative importance of productive sectors provide the
direction followed by the legal evolution in domestic commercial rules i.e. amend- Ž
ments to the commercial code addressing new specific commands regulating
economics interactions and also provide the direction followed by the legal .
evolution in domestic commercial standards i.e. amendments to the commercial Ž
. 4 code addressing new general norms pertaining to economic interactions .
Testing this general theory within the Latin American historical context, one can
find out that a bottom-up approach to law-making in the commercial area provided
the framework for international legal and economic convergence during the period
within which the Gold Standard ruled international trade.5 This period was
characterized by the emergence of manufacturing capital-intensive industries in
Latin America that were aiming at reaching economies of scale by expanding sales
to foreign markets Muniz, 1951b . In this context, Latin American new industries Ž .
attempted to sponsor international economic integration schemes since the early
stages of their history. As a result, governments reacted before these powerful
industrial groups by seeking international legal and economic regional agreements.
There is a rich historical background addressing legal interrelations within the
region. Starting with the Congress of Panama in 1826 and the Congress of Lima in
1864-65 where Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru took the first steps toward greater
legal harmony by adopting a postal treaty and a trade and navigation treaty Muniz, Ž
1951b . In these treaties, all the contracting parties expressed their resolve to .
provide their reciprocal trade with all possible facilities and protection, ‘as one of
the most effective means of promoting the development and growth of their
industry and wealth and making a future Confederation of states more secure and
prosperous’.6 Both in the Trade and Navigation 1864 Treaties, there is an express
provision for natives or nationals of all contracting Latin American states to be
considered as equals with regard to a wide range of objectives and areas. This
principle went on to become the direct legal foundation of what would later be
known as the Latin American principle of equality of nationals and foreigners
regarding the international liability of states when foreign nationals are subject to
torts andor property damage. Moreover, the First Treaty of Lima signed by
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru in 1848 contains a rule whereby the
contracts signed and documents executed in one of the signatory republics would
have the same force and validity in the others, and the authorities, judges, and
courts would be required to enforce them.7 New initiatives presented by the

4
Forces related to the determination of comparative advantages in production and that the composition
of a country’s trade reflects the relative abundance of factors in that country’s endowment, also
determine the composition and relative strength of productive sectors. These economic forces, however,
are always enhanced or hampered by the political weight of organized constituencies. For an understanding
of the economic factors’ impact on the determination of the productive structure, see Wright
Ž. Ž. 1990 and North 1982 . 5
A partial account of international legal treaties during the 19th century is taken from Muniz 1951a . Ž . 6

governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile led to the Congress of Jurists held in
Lima between 1877 and 1880 establishing uniform rules in the design of private
international law.8
Subsequently, during the Second Congress of Jurists, held in Montevideo in
188889, eight treaties and an additional protocol were adopted. These treaties
were sponsored and drafted by Argentine, Brazilian, and Chilean jurists. The
treaties covered procedural law, literary and artistic property, patents for inventions,
trademarks and brand names, international criminal law, and international
civil law.9 The protocol contained general rules for applying the laws of any of the
contracting states in the territories of the others. Later, Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Peru proposed a major step in legal integration when their intention in
codifying international law was recognized in the Convention for the Drafting of
Codes on Public and Private International Law, signed in 1902, and during the
International Law Convention, signed at the Inter American Conference of Rio de
Janeiro in 1906.10 Both treaties established methods and procedures to further the
process of legal codification and cooperation at the Inter-American level. In all
these cases, the countries pushing for international legal integration were at the
same time experiencing changes in their trade-related economic structures that
were addressed through amendments to their domestic commercial andor civil
codes. In other words, one can conclude that during the 19th century and early
20th century we can already observe a pattern of legal harmonization driven by
international trade and economic change.
The process of codification of private international law in the Inter-American
context has clearly been one of the ongoing legal activities of the American states
since the closing decades of the last century. This work has taken on different
institutional forms and is currently being carried out as a legal process through the
Specialized Conferences on Private International Law CIDIP under the auspices Ž .
of the United Nations. Since the start of the codification of private international
law, two different approaches have been taken: one involved a global approach that
envisaged a single body of rules covering all aspects of private law; the other
approach envisaged a process that was more gradual and progressive, involving the
drafting of specific international instruments. The approach of drafting a single
code was the prevailing one during the aforementioned 1877 Congress of Lima and
culminated in the adoption of a single code of international law, the Bustamante
Code, at the Sixth International Conference of American States in Havana in
1928.11

This constitutes the Latin American legal response to the Paris and Berne Conventions in Europe.

Beginning in the 1960s and as part of the Organization of American States
Ž . OAS framework, the Inter American Juridical Committee made efforts to codify
all the different areas of private international law. To that end and in light of the
US Restatement of the Law of the Conflicts of Laws for private international law,
the Committee proposed to review the Bustamante Code to determine whether it
was possible to merge its provisions with those of the Montevideo Treaties of 1889
and 193940. The First Specialized Conference in Private Law adopted conventions
covering international trade and procedural law in 1975. These are the Inter
American conventions on conflict of laws concerning bills of exchange, promissory
notes, and invoices; on conflict of laws concerning checks; on international
commercial arbitration; on letters; on the taking of evidence abroad; and on the
legal regime of powers of attorney to be used abroad. The 1979 Second Specialized
Inter-American Conference also approved conventions on international trade law
and international procedural law focusing on rules concerning checks and conflicts
of laws involving commercial companies. With respect to international procedural
law, these Inter-American conventions covered standards of proof and discovery
material, enforcement of injunctions, and extraterritorial validity of foreign rulings
and arbitral awards. Lastly, the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Specialized Conference
approved the Inter American Convention on Law to be applied to international
contracts where the first common ground for a hemispheric commercial code was
established. As a result of this effort, the Inter American Juridical Committee
prepared a draft code, but it was not supported by the member states of the OAS
Ž . Muniz, 1951c . This situation led to the abandonment of the global approach of
codification of Inter-American codification, and the beginning of a second stage in
which sectoral codification prevailed Muniz, 1951d . Ž .
In fact, during the mid 20th century one can already observe that, under the
OAS umbrella, those countries that were not undergoing profound economic
changes in their private sector structure did not show and, in fact, did not support a
legal integration sponsored by the relatively more complex legal and economic
national systems of the region. Moreover, the countries supporting legal integration
were in all cases the ones subject to more dynamic economic changes
Ž . Argentina, Brazil and Chile , while reservations and opposition emerged from the
Ž . mostly traditional-agrarian economies i.e. Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay .12
In this context and within the OAS framework, intergovernmental meetings were
scheduled to deal with special technical and limited matters or to develop special
aspects of inter-American cooperation Garcia-Lopez, 1973 . Ž .
As result of all of the above agreements, the legal systems in countries such as
Argentina, Brazil, and Chile started to address new types of economic interactions
reflecting higher levels of specialization and division of labor within their domestic
markets. As the relative growth of their agricultural sectors diminished and
information intensive sectors of the economy grew, commercial codes became

subject to major re-drafting. Table 1 covers the period 18901995 and shows the
number of economic-related amendments introduced to the commercial codes in
each country. The amendments included in this table were all aimed at addressing
new types of economic interactions as the direct result of the growth of the
non-agricultural manufacturing and service sectors. These non-agricultural manufacturing
and service sectors were composed of firms producing agro-manufacturing,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, steel, financial services, transportation, communications
and energy Vazquez Presedo, 1981 . Ž .
Finally, we also measure the number of international legal agreements addressing
harmonization of commercial laws. Table 1 compares the dynamic economies
of Argentina, Brazil and Chile where the average real annual growth in sales of Ž
the non-agricultural manufacturing and service industries during the period
18901995 exceeded 2% annually to countries that experienced no significant .
changes in the number and relative strength of their non-agricultural manufacturing
and service sectors such as Bolivia, Ecuador, Uruguay and Venezuela.
As shown in Table 1, there is a strong association among the three legal and
economic variables. That is, the number of non-agricultural industries experiencing
an average of more than 2% of real growth in their compounded annual sales i.e. Ž
capturing the speed of economic changes in their national economic structure is .
associated with a higher number of legal amendments to the commercialcivil
codes addressing the new type of economic interactions taking place within the new
industries. Moreover, these two patterns are also associated with a strong drive of a
country to harmonize its commercial legal framework through international traderelated
agreements. For example, we observe that Brazil and Argentina who
possess the most dynamic economies during the period 18901995 with 12 and 11 Ž
new non-agricultural trade-related industries, respectively are also the countries .
74 E. Buscaglia Emerging Markets Reiew 2 2001 67 ( ) 85

with the largest number of amendments to their commercialcivil codes 402 and Ž
353, respectively and with the largest number of trade-related legal treaties signed .
Ž . i.e. 20 for Argentina and 24 for Brazil . As was claimed above, more complex
economic systems i.e. a larger number of high growth trade-related non-agricult- Ž
ural industries reflect a higher complexity in their domestic legal systems mea- .
sured through the introduction of amendments in their civilcommercial codes. At
the same time, Table 1 also shows that the more dynamic economies are also more
likely to harmonize their legal systems through international legal agreements. The
international legal agreements measured here cover the harmonization of legal
standards e.g. health standards applied to merchandise crossing international Ž
borders , the harmonization of legal standards applied to commerce in general e.g. . Ž
codifying the principles of territoriality and independence , the harmonization of .
rules e.g. duration and scope of patents , and the harmonization of legal doctrines Ž .
Že.g. the doctrine of equivalence in the treatment of real property or the fair use
. 13 doctrine in the use of copyrights . For example, one can observe that starting in
the mid 19th century, Latin American countries started to adhere to two fundamental
legal standards addressing the enforcement of laws: first, the principle of
territoriality, based on the premise that rights and obligations need to be honored
according to each state’s domestic rules. This principle is also known as the Calo
Doctrine. This doctrine maintains that ‘aliens are only entitled to those legal rights
and privileges enjoyed by nationals, and hence may seek redress for grievances only
before local authorities and to the extent permitted by local law’.14 The second
principle of independence indicated that the definition of rights within one state
does not force other states to grant the same rights. Clearly, these two principles
are examples of international harmonization of laws.
Table 2 breaks down the pattern of international agreements for each country
and shows a clear picture where the region’s most dynamic economies are also the
ones that are more likely to reach international legal commercial agreements
involving harmonization of rules and standards.15
One can also argue that as an increasing number of business exchanges occur in
countries with overlapping growing trade-related sectors, their need for legal
harmonization will tend to increase. This could explain why in Table 2 we observe
that most attempts to harmonize legal frameworks have mainly involved countries
such as Argentina, Brazil and Chile. These countries all experienced growth in

13All of these international agreements deal with measures related to strengthening foreign investment
protection, simplifying technical standards, regulating professional services, standards to be
applied to the intepretation of territoriality and independence, and the harmonization in the enforcement
of tangible and intangible property rights e.g. introducing the doctrine of equivalence, the Ž
doctrine of fair use in copyrights, rules dealing with duration and scope of patents, and standards to be
applied to the intepretation of pipeline protection .. 14The Calvo Doctrine, named after Argentine jurist Carlos Calvo 1824 Ž . 1906 was adopted by most
Latin American states in the 19th century. For an analysis of this doctrine, see Abbott 1976 . Ž . 15Note that an international legal agreement addressing the harmonization of standards is a much
weaker form of harmonization than the international agreements involving the international convergence
in commercial rules.

Asymmetries in market size are usually blamed for failures to reach economic
and legal integration. If one aims at understanding the social forces behind these
and other drives for legal convergence, the most promising approach is provided,
not just by addressing the differences in market size. In contrast, international legal
convergence must also be understood within the frameworks proposed by North
Ž. Ž. 1982 and Olson 1982 and here applied to the international case studied here. In
our case, foreign pressures coupled with the political weight and rent-seeking of
the lobby groups associated with the main productive domestic sectors affected by
integration in our case, trade-related sectors influences the political actors’ Ž .
perceptions of the costs and benefits of legal convergence. For example, Buscaglia
Ž . 1994a shows that during the 19th century the domestic political processes
throughout the region assigned greater political weight to landowners and merchants
linked to the export sectors during a time when the Gold Standard ruled the
world of international trade and financial flows Buscaglia, 1994a . In this context, Ž .
legal change and integration had little to do with social welfare maximization and
much more to do with international political influence and domestic redistributive
arguments, what Schwartz and Sykes 1996 denominate ‘political welfare-maximi- Ž .
zation’.16 It can be then said that redistributive forces may slow down or speed up
the process of institutional reform, but there is no doubt that political welfare-maximization
related factors have had a powerful influence in shaping legal institutions
throughout Latin American history. For example, one can observe that in Argentina,
Brazil, and Chile, ad hoc advising congressional committees composed
exclusively of landowners and merchants connected to the exports sector, joined by

foreign pressure business groups, were asked to provide assessments of the civil,
commercial, and criminal codes during the amendment procedures Perez, 1963a . Ž .
The advice provided by these committees was often quoted and followed during the
debates in the Senate and Chambers of Deputies Perez, 1963b . Moreover, the Ž .
opinions issued by these committees were the foundation of key changes to the
newly enacted codes. No other domestic groups were included in this political
process. All this occurred during the period when the Gold Standard determined
the terms of trade and trade patterns worldwide and during which all countries in
Latin America were dependent upon foreign capital for their development.17
One should also pay attention to other catalysts of legal change. For example,
starting in the mid 20th century, developed economies generating technologies, led
by the United States, started to rely heavily on the application of unilateral
pressure and sanctions in order to stop the infringement of their multinationals’
property rights. Suspension of preferential tariffs and trade sanctions were the
most common policy tools for punishing developing countries.18 Foreign pressures
notwithstanding, this study also shows that the trade-related legal convergence
observed throughout Latin America is mainly explained by favorable incentives
within the political and economic systems of the region.
Based on the historical experience explained above, one can also show that the
most recent legal reforms introduced within the legal systems of Latin America’s
largest exporters during the 1990s are also following this same historical pattern of
harmonizations. Following the same historical pattern described above, legal reforms
in Latin American countries are still the product of the joint effect of local
political conditions and foreign economic pressures Buscaglia, 1994a . In this Ž .
respect, recent constitutional reforms in Latin America have done nothing to
either enhance or to hamper the already strong historical trend in international
economic-related legal harmonization within the region Buscaglia, 1994b; Ž
Buscaglia and Guerrero, 1995 . Furthermore, regardless of the latest constitutional .
reforms in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico, Buscaglia and Guerrero 1995 Ž .
have shown that foreign economic pressures to reform commercial laws during the
period 195094 arose particularly because an increasing proportion of imports to
these countries consisted of information-intensive and capital-intensive goods and
19 services. For example, Buscaglia and Guerrero 1995 show that in countries with Ž .
a poor enforcement record and lack of international harmonization drive, intellectual
property was subject to a constant pattern of infringements due to the lack of
a domestic producer base with a stake in this modern sector.20 As a result,

17For a description of how the Gold Standard affected international business transactions, see
McKinnon 1982 . Ž . 18An example of unilateral measures aimed at inducing legal changes in Latin America is provided by
the Omnibus Trade and Competitieness Act of 1988, 19. 1301-1303 amending Section 301 of the Trade Ž
Act of 1974 to include a ‘Special 301’ to deal with intellectual property protection. . Section 301 .
authorizes the US Government to reduce Generalized System of Preferences GSP benefits i.e. Ž. Ž

advanced-country firms generating these technologies were then demanding their
governments’ use of trade sanctions or threats of loss of trade benefits as a way to
punish less-developed countries’ unauthorized use of intellectual property.21
From a domestic policy perspective, Buscaglia 1994a also shows that a move- Ž .
ment toward legal integration also covered the period within which an import
substitution approach to development was implemented. As a product of the Great
Depression, from the early 1930s until the 1980s, Latin America and almost all
other developing countries encouraged domestic import substitution manufactur- Ž .
ing investment, suppressed agricultural prices, and expanded the size of their
public sector enterprises while attempting to stimulate savings and investment
through taxation and credit allocated by the public sector. The prevailing view was
that a shortage of domestic physical capital was the key impediment to developmentIn
this context, Latin America’s attempts at legal integration during the period
19301980 were also conceived as an integral part of this import-substituting
industrialization ISI , a strategy strongly advocated and supported by the Economic Ž .
Commission for Latin America ECLA , a branch of the United Nations known Ž. Ž
more widely in Latin America by its Spanish nomenclature: Comision Economica
para America Latina or CEPAL . For ECLA . CEPAL, regional integration offered
a way to provide markets large enough to satisfy economies of scale and scope
which would, in turn, strengthen the import-substitution process. Non-reciprocity
and preferential treatment were to be granted through international legal agreements
in accordance with, or dependent upon, the level of economic development
of individual countries. Tariff barriers against countries outside the region would
serve to protect Latin American products and enable them to compete more
effectively against foreign imports. In brief, the ECLA recipe for regional integration
was an inward-looking strategy, conceived and understood as a ‘collective
defense’ for sheltering Latin America from adverse fluctuations in the world
economy Rosenthal, 1991 . Ž .
Import substitution industries grew behind protective walls based on subsidies
and tariffs in a milieu where many other determinants of the rate of economic

from a historical perspective. The Paris and Berne Conventions, administered by the World
Intellectual Property Organization WIPO , governed the international protection of intellectual Ž .
property during more than a century. The Paris Convention, Berne Convention, and others that are
assigned to protect intellectual property, are administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization
WIPO , founded in 1967 as a specialized agency of the United Nations. The three most important Ž .
international agreements under WIPO are: 1 the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Ž .
Property 103 nation members established in 1883; 2 the Madrid Agreement concerning the Ž . Ž.
International Registration of Marks 29 states adopted in 1891; and 3 the Berne Convention for the Ž . Ž.

growth, such as investment in human capital and the role of microeconomic
incentives, were completely ignored by policymakers. Protection of import substitution
industries allowed domestic prices and costs to far exceed international prices
and created little incentive for efficiency. These protected industries produced
substitutes for imports but usually depended on the import of raw materials and
technology. Domestic demands for foreign exchange and the region’s international
debt grew rapidly over time as these firms and their governments imported capital
goods to accelerate investment Buscaglia and Ulen, 1996 . In this context, the Ž .
import substitution approach to development came to an end during the international
debt crisis of the 1980s when developing countries’ policymakers realized that
internal markets and protection of infant industries were not enough to assure
sustainable growth.22
The failure of the ISI strategy combined with the second oil shock, debt crises,
and recession in the developed world which reduced the demand for developing- Ž
country exports led to the 1980s Latin American economic crisis. As a result, .
international legal harmonizations acquired a new form. By the early 1980s most
countries in the region started to adopt pro-business market-driven economic
policies to address the problems posed by large foreign debts, high inflation, and
huge fiscal deficits. The ultimate goal of this free-market economic prescription
was to push through legislative bodies laws needed to deregulate and liberalize
trade so that the market, rather than the state, would be the ultimate referee on
how resources would be allocated.23

3. A jurimetric analysis of the economic factors affecting international legal
harmonization

The regional drive towards legal harmonization in Latin America has never been
uniform. More specifically, one can observe that countries with overlapping dynamic
trade-related sectors i.e. experiencing a higher proportion of intra-sectoral Ž
international trade as a proportion of total trade also have private sectors .
demanding compatible legal frameworks in their foreign markets within the areas
affecting their products or foreign direct investment within their sector of the
economy. We have already described how this has been true under both, the
import substitution industrialization and the export-driven periods. In this context,
imagine two types of countries hoping to harmonize their commercial laws:
countries where private commercial laws are not far from their evolutionary
agrarian base and with weak non-agricultural sectors producing information-inten22
For a complete description of this process, see Buscaglia 1993 . Ž . 23As part of this new strategy and in order to address the crises, some countries ammended their
constitutions e.g. Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico , while others pursued this new approach to Ž .
policy-making on a legal piece meal basis e.g. Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela . For more details on the Ž .
nature of the region’s domestic legal reforms see Barragan 1994 . For details on the macroeconomic Ž .
aspects of reforms refer to Edwards 1991 . Ž .

sive products exist e.g. Bolivia, Paraguay , and, in contrast, countries with rela- Ž .
tively evolved commercial legal systems i.e. legal systems addressing a much wider Ž
range and higher complexity of economic interactions and with a high proportion .
of their trade concentrated on dynamic sectors such as Argentina, Brazil and Ž
Chile . The quantitative evidence Tables 1 and 2 and the analysis advanced would . Ž.
predict that legal harmonization involving agrarian countries, possessing legal
systems that are not far from its evolutionary base, will have less motives to seek
legal integration. For example, one can currently observe that private sector firms
in Bolivia or Uruguay importing Brazilian computer software and hardware,
compact disks, or movies, actually oppose the enactment of foreign investment
protection or intellectual property laws compatible with the needs and interests of
the Brazilian firms exporting these products to Bolivia.24Let’s now test the above
hypotheses. We measure the following independent variables that are aimed at
explaining a country’s drive to harmonize its laws:
The number of economic-related amendments to a country’s civilcommercial
codes Ž . no. of ammendments ;
The annual number of non-agricultural trade-related industries experiencing an
average annual real growth of 2% or more in their compounded annual sales.
This variable is designed to capture the economic dynamics and changes in
economic structure Ž . no. of non-agricultural trade-related industries ;
The average intra-sectoral international trade as a proportion of total trade
Ž . aerage intra-trade as a percentage of total trade ;
The relative size of the national GDP as compared to the region’s GDP
Ž . national GDP as a percentage of the region’s GDP ; and
The annual growth in trade between pairs of countries Ž growth in international
trade..

By applying multiple least squares regression analysis, in Table 3 we can see that
the first three explanatory variables are significant at the 5% level and all have the
expected signs. That is, a country’s larger number of international legal agreements
aimed at harmonizing its commercial laws with the rest of the world will be
explained by first, the higher number of amendments to its domestic civil code
indicating the presence of a higher domestic legal complexity addressing new types
of economic interactions; second, by a higher percentage growth in its international
intra-sectoral trade with the region i.e. showing the presence of domestic economic Ž
actors with a stake in harmonizing international rules in order to expand their
markets abroad on a ‘one lawone market’ basis , and, third, by a higher annual .
percentage growth in sales within the non-agricultural trade-related sectors i.e. Ž
showing the presence of demand driven trade-related sectors aiming at expanding
its markets ..
Please note that the annual number of international legal accords used to
measure our dependant discrete variable include all agreements involving the

An exponential link among the variables was tested and rejected for lack of fitness. The Sims’ test
was also applied in order to show the direction of causality. The data related to the number of
international legal agreements per country as our dependent variable are contained in Carcano 1941 ; Ž . Ž.
from Urrutia 1994 . In dealing with the independent or explanatory variables the data were drawn from Ž .
the following sources: i the annual number of amendments to the domestic civil codes dealing with Ž .

The international legal agreements include data on the harmonization of legal standards e.g. Ž
health standards applied to merchandise crossing international borders , the harmonization of legal .
standards applied to commerce in general e.g. codifying the principles of territoriality and indepen- Ž
dence , the harmonization of rules e.g. duration and scope of patents and the harmonization of legal .Ž .
doctrines e.g. the doctrine of equivalence in the treatment of real property or the fair use doctrine in Ž

trade-related non agricultural industries defined. However, the relative size of a
country within the region national GDP as a percentage of the region’s GDP and Ž .
the annual percentage growth in international trade between two countries growth Ž
in trade show no significance in the explanation of legal harmonizing agreements. .
In other words, relative size and movements in annual international trade, in
general, do not explain a country’s drive to harmonize international legal standards
and legal rules. Finally, we see that 51.4% of the variability in our dependent
variable is explained by the independent variables included here.
Therefore, the jurimetrics results here are consistent with the fact that a large
proportion of international trade based on intra-sectoral exchanges between two
countries creates an incentive for the private sectors in these countries to demand
harmony in the rules of their international trade i.e. a drive towards a ‘one Ž
market-one law’ business condition Buscaglia and Long, 1997 . This simply means .Ž .

that a bottom-up legal framework would emerge if enough overlapping in economic
structures exist. Table 4 addresses this point by showing the proportion of total
intra-sectoral bilateral trade for a sample of agrarian and ‘dynamic’ economies. As
stated, one would expect that the larger the proportion of intra-sectoral trade, the
more pronounced the propensity to seek legal harmonization.
Based on the evidence shown in Table 4, we expect that a larger proportion of
export-driven dynamic economic sectors engaging in intra-sectoral trade, such as
Argentina, Brazil and Chile, would be actively supporting economic integration and
the harmonization of commercial rules applied within their industries sectors. Fig.
1 shows the historical pattern relating high levels of intra-sectoral trade with a
strong drive to seek legal integration. The number of trade-related international
agreements is measured on the vertical axis while a country’s proportion of total
international trade classified as intra-sectoral trade is measured on the horizontal
axis. One can observe a pattern already established in the correlation and regression
analyses presented above. If one considers the period 18901990, the agrarian
economies of South America have shown a poor record in seeking international
legal harmonization while those economies with private sectors engaged in crossborder
trade and investments tend to seek a ‘one-marketone-law’ approach to
international exchanges.25
Historical evidence shows that industries such as agro-manufacturing,
computer-related material, food manufacturing, energy and textiles actively support
policies to harmonize international commercial laws by actively lobbying
before the Argentine and Brazilian Congress.26 These industries have also pushed
for the establishment of more effective and uniform procedures for dispute
resolution mechanisms.27 For example, MERCOSUR’s provision for binational

25The graph shows Venezuela as an outlier within the group. The linearized fit was tested and met.
Moreover, the standard assumptions required by the regression analysis presented above have been
met. 26 Id. at 56. 27This is a clear trend in public opinion observed in Gallup polls throughout the region. For more
details, see Buscaglia and Dakolias 1995 . The results indicate that in samples of 60 Ž . 100 firms per
country, the majority of these enterprises consider the role of the judiciary to be ‘deficient’. These
businesses consider the lack of a reliable judiciary within MERCOSUR countries as one of the main
reasons for seeking a predictable dispute resolution mechanism. Id. at pp. 2531.

corporations has led to the establishment of 11 Argentine-Brazilian joint ventures,
particularly in communications, computer, and pharmaceutical industries that are
designed to expand market operations.28 In addition, at least a hundred agreements
for cross-border cooperation have been signed between Argentine and
Brazilian companies in industries as diverse as automotive, banking, steel, aluminum
and plastic.29 MERCOSUR has also provided the legal framework for sector-bysector
agreements among private entrepreneurial associations that has contributed
to the harmonization of rules aforementioned. For example, Argentine and Brazilian
associations of steel producers have signed 34 and 30 accords regulating the
treatment of patents, copyrights and trademarks.30 In contrast, for the reasons
shown, the same degree of harmonization efforts is not observed among Uruguayan
and Paraguayan firms and no legal integration initiatives have been advanced or
accepted from the governments of Uruguay and Paraguay Ministry of Foreign Ž
Affairs, 1994 ..

4. Conclusion

Social scientists have usually viewed regional institutional integration as a series
of multiple interactions among national governments that would lead to the
creation of new supranational decision-making institutions
to which the national
governments would gradually cede their authority over domestic issues. In this
mainstream view, the citizens of those states would eventually and passively come
to redefine their loyalties and extend their identification to encompass the new

entity Dougherty and Pfaltzgraff, 1990 . In this context, during the 1960s and 70s, Ž .
functional theorists viewed integration as a linear development and as a state-driven
process in which such regional groupings would pass through successive stages of
ever increasing institutionalization. It was assumed that initial state-by-state initiatives
would lead to ‘spillover’ effects in which, as the scope of integration deepened
and broadened, closer cooperation in one area would engender
in a positive way
the movement toward integration in other related areas as well.
However, this mainstream account does not fit the historical evolution of legal
and economic integration in developing countries in general and within Latin
America specifically. Spillover effects failed to materialize Buscaglia and Long, Ž
1997 . After some promising beginnings, most regional integration efforts in . Ž
Africa, Asia and Latin America tended to lose steam and, after a period of time, .
collapse. It has been argued that this linear theory of how integration develops is
not really applicable to Latin America because the ‘balance between the push of
formal institution building and the pull of informal interactions tends to be
unstable and fragile’.31 Nonetheless, conventional theory posits that regional
integration must be accompanied by a process of formal and state-driven institution-building
if it hopes to survive Mols, 1993 . Ž .
In contrast, our framework proposed here views legal harmonization of commercial
rules of international trade as a result of a bottom-up process driven by related
economic industries on different sides of international borders engaging in increasing
intra-sectoral trade. This contrasts with the aforementioned top-down conventional
approach used to understand past drives to legal and economic integration.
In our framework, we showed that once a trade agreement has been organized, its
future development and growth is much determined and driven by the private
sector’s perceptions
whether real or apparent
of the issues and burdens they
must face. In this context, history shows that the states that comprise a successful
regional bloc must constantly deal and address the pros and cons of integration-related
issues brought before them by a variety of private actors, domestic and
international. How are integration-related benefits distributed among, and across,
the member countries? In other words, who gains and who loses from integra- Ž .
tion? Do the payoffs justify the effort? Do some partners reap benefits at the
expense of others? In the final analysis, these are crucial considerations that also
determine the ultimate success or failure of regional cooperationintegration over
the long run. Yet, scholars of the so-called ‘realist’ school of international relations,
which holds that states operate at the international level in a state of
anarchy, must come to terms with the inisible hand behind the success or failure
of their efforts. As shown above through the examination of our jurimetric
evidence, international differences in the composition and nature of the economic
structures of the countries involved will represent the real obstacle or promoter of
legaleconomic integration. Given this context, foreign pressures on developing
countries coupled with the compatibility of economic structures trading across

borders have all combined to create the incentives needed for the international
harmonization of legal rules and standards.
