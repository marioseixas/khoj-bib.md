the functioning of politics due to the emphasis respectively on international conflicts and the promotion of liberal

limited the scope of what could be found as an explanation.

Shiller (2015) defines irrational exuberance as the psychological basis of speculative bubbles, which constitute a
situation in which an increase in the price of shares fills the investor with enthusiasm, which psychologically infects
other people and, in turn, reinforces the rise in shares and amplifies justifications for this rise, attracting more
classes of investors through envy of other people's success, as well as excessive optimism.

The four authors of the study in question are generally cited using their initials, LLSV. According to Collison

La Porta, with 2,394, and Vishny, with 1,531.

According to this explanation, managers return the income from invested resources because they hope to
raise more resources in the future from the capital market. Therefore, establishing a good payment reputation
is essential to influence future investors (SHLEIFER and VISHNY, 1997).

In the study A Survey of Corporate Governance (1997), Shleifer and Vishny conceptualize corporate
governance as a way in which investors guarantee the return of resources invested in companies. Corporate
governance mechanisms, in turn, are conceptualized as economic and legal institutions that can be changed
through a political process.

According to this approach, investors would offer their resources, expecting appreciation in the company's
short-term securities, without reflecting on the means of recovering their investments. An extremist possibility

this would be the occurrence of a Ponzi Scheme, in which the company that raises funds uses resources in a
fraudulent and sequential manner: it pays high returns to past investors with the resources of future investors
(SHLEIFER and VISHNY, 1997).
One of the conclusions reached by the study was that the three corporate governance systems analyzed,
the United States, Germany and Japan, present significant combinations of legal protection for investors with
concentration of ownership, whether through majority shareholders, corporate reorganizations or large bank
creditors.
According to Jensen and Meckling (1976, pp. 308), agency theory explains business behavior based on the
difference in interests between company administrators, holders of managerial control, and investors, holders
of company ownership. The agency relationship involves a contract by which the principal (individual or
ownership group) delegates powers to another (the agent) so that he or she can carry out activities of interest
to the principal. Starting from the premise that both are utility maximizers, the theory assumes that there are
incentives for divergence between the agent's behavior and the principal's interest. Such divergence can be
limited by the principal, but this implies costs (agency costs), which can be summarized as: (i) costs of
monitoring the agent by the principal; (ii) costs (pecuniary or otherwise) of the agent himself to demonstrate
compliance with his obligations to the principal; (iii) costs of drafting contracts aimed at reducing agency costs;
and (iv) residual losses resulting from the reduction of wealth by the principal and resulting from unavoided
divergences between the agent's decisions and the principal's interests.
According to Demsetz (1967), property rights are understood as a bundle of rights over a thing, an instrument
of society that allows an individual to form expectations of keeping that asset under their control in relationships
with other participants in society. Despite this broad definition of property rights theory, Jensen and Meckling
(1976, pp.307) restrict property rights to what is generally defined contractually regarding the determination of
how gains and costs will be distributed among the participants of a business organization. .

According to Fama and Miller (1972), finance theory deals with how individuals and companies allocate
resources over time. She explains how the existence of capital markets, which allow means of exchanging
resources available at different points in time, facilitate solutions to resource allocation problems by companies.

Shleifer and Vishny (1997) cite the expropriation of assets by managers through the use of transfer prices as
direct costs. They also mention Grossman and Hart (1988), who describe other forms of manifestation of this
problem: private benefits of control, such as indirect gains and superfluous travel, irrational expansion of the
company, the manager remaining in a management position even when contrary to the interests of shareholders.

The first analysis in this sense was carried out in The Modern Corporation and Private Property, by Berle and
Means (1932), which dominated the research agenda of the North American commercial law academy in the 50
years following its publication. According to this approach, modern companies are characterized by the separation
between those who have legal ownership over them and those who actually control them. The first group would be
represented by shareholders, while the second by the board of directors and business managers. This division
results in management groups that seek private benefits from control to the detriment of the interests of shareholders,
who, as they are diffuse, have little incentive to monitor the companies to which they have allocated their resources.
As a result, without robust regulation, shareholders would be harmed by powerful executives (CHEFFINS, 2013).

Cheffins (2013) states that the study by Jensen and Meckling (1976) is the most cited in research on corporate
governance. The author, citing Ocasio and Joseph (2005), states that 1976 was also the year in which the term
“corporate governance” was used for the first time in the official journal of the North American federal government.

Faced with the perception of greater importance of corporate governance, scholars of financial economics
would have started to place greater emphasis on the analysis of the political and regulatory environment, what
Jensen (1993, pp. 872) calls “finance politics”. From that moment on, Jensen (1993) argues that economists
inclined to normative theory would be more interested in making the internal control systems of companies
seek efficiency and optimization of the value of companies, while economists focused on positive economics
would have as their greatest challenge understand how these internal systems interact with market, legal,
political and regulatory factors.
In the 1990s, the best corporate governance system was discussed. On the one hand, there was the system
of dispersed ownership, marked by a thriving capital market, with great transparency and strong governance
mechanisms. On the other hand, there was a concentrated ownership system, characterized by weak capital
markets and low transparency (COFFEE, 2000). Shleifer and Vishny (1997) found that successful systems of
corporate governance, such as those practiced in the United States, Germany and Japan, combined
characteristics of these two typical models: legal protection for minority investors and a relevant role for majority
shareholders. Although these authors did not find evidence of superiority of one of these governance systems
over the other two, these three systems together, according to Shleifer and Vishny (1997), were considered
superior to the others, such as Italy and Russia, characterized as having low protection. minority investor or
with companies controlled by families and internal managers.

Jensen (1993), economist of the Law and Economics approach , suggests a change in perception on the
part of economists about the lack of regulation in financial markets in the early 1990s. For Jensen (1993), data
collected until then would have corroborated failures in systems of internal control headed by boards of directors
in large corporations. This would have prevented managers from maximizing the efficiency and value of these
entities, which was one of the propositions of the theory of firm ownership. Jensen (1993) stated that conflicts
between managers and investors would have played a central role in understanding finance.

The CRI is an index that aggregates four variables: (i) existence of mandatory minimum requirements, such as
creditor consensus, for requesting judicial recovery; (ii) possibility of liquidation of guarantees in case of approval of
the request for judicial recovery; (iii) preference for secured creditors in the event of bankruptcy; and (iv) judicial

The ADI is an index that aggregates six variables indicative of the existence of six rules favorable to shareholders
within a jurisdiction: (i) possibility for the shareholder to vote by means other than in person; (ii) possibility of trading
company shares prior to general meetings; (iii) existence of proportional representation on the board of directors;
(iv) existence of judicial mechanisms for challenging majority decisions; (v) minimum percentage of shares required
to be less than or equal to 10% to call an extraordinary meeting; and (vi) existence of preference in the purchase of
new issues (“anti-dilution” rights). If the country analyzed had any of these provisions in its law, a value of 1 was
noted. Otherwise, zero. The ADI therefore varies from zero to six (LA PORTA et al., 1997; SPAMANN, 2010).

Michaels (2009) points out that one of the exponents of Law and Finance literature, Simeon Djankov, held
the post of chief economist at the World Bank for years, leading the Doing Business Project. Djankov was
also Chairman of the Board of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) as well as
Minister of Finance of Bulgaria (2009-2013). Incidentally, the presence of the main authors of this literature
is noted in highly visible positions in the 1990s and 2000s. La Porta and Lopez-de-Silanes were advisors to
the Financial System Commission in Mexico, while Lopez-de-Silanes held a similar in the IMF and the World
Bank (COLLISON ET AL., 2011).

Brazil received one of these projects, which gave rise to the Center for Studies and Research in the Teaching
of Law (CEPED), the result of a partnership between the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV), the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Ford Foundation . CEPED trained 228 lawyers in its five
years of existence (1967-1972), with innovation in legal education through an interdisciplinary curriculum, with
teachers such as Mário Henrique Simonsen, and emphasis on the consequences of law for the economy and
business (TRUBEK , 2007).

Trubek and Galanter (1974) define “paradigm of liberal legalism” as a set of premises about the interaction of
law and society, among them: (i) centrality of the state in controlling and promoting social changes; (ii) legal
norms as instruments of social transformation; (iii) presumption that there is equivalence between legal changes
and changes in social behavior; (iv) presumption that legal professions always defend the public interest; (v)
presumption of institutional convergence of the legal systems of less developed countries towards institutions
from more developed countries.
According to Davis and Trebilcock (2001), this is the view of development as the adoption of a pre-established
model of society, which is later characterized as the theory of modernization. According to this approach,
development implies institutional convergence of less developed countries with standards from Western
developed countries, which can be summarized with the adoption of the rule of law through legal transplants.

83 Research carried out on the websites of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate on November

Complementary Law Project nº 446 of 2014, which, according to its summary, establishes incentives,
including through the improvement of the business environment in the country, for investments made in
business participation through venture capital. This is the result of a study carried out by the technicaladvisory
body of the Chamber of Deputies, the Center for the Study of Strategic Debates (Cedes). The study
deals with private equity and venture capital, or even venture capital or entrepreneurial capital, a form of
investment whose objective is “to enable or accelerate the development of companies – often privately held
and with high growth potential – through the effective involvement of a professional manager in the business”.
On the occasion of its official presentation by Rep. Inocêncio Oliveira, then President of Cedes, a publication
entitled “Capital Empreendedor” was launched, which in addition to conveying the text of the proposal of
PLP 446/2014, exposes the results of the study. Among them, mention is made of “the identification of
shortcomings in our legislation”, such as “insufficient legal protection for investors who direct their resources
to temporary participation in privately held companies”. To illustrate, PLP 446/2014 proposes, as one of the
solutions to the “deficiencies” identified, the improvement of the disregard of legal personality, in order to
avoid that “investors are legally liable for amounts that significantly exceed the capital they invested”
(CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES, 2014).

Schapiro (2009, pp. 197) defines venture capital as an investment tool in emerging companies, according
to which the capital contribution occurs through concentrated equity participation, in charge of specialized
investors, who have mechanisms to actively monitor the management of the invested company. Through
this mechanism, the aim is to reduce the risks resulting from the asymmetry of information between
entrepreneurs and investors, as well as any lack of managerial knowledge in new companies.
