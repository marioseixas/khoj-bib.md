2. What do you think about the methodological plans outlined in section 3? A priori, from an
epistemological point of view , why are the methodological options biased, quantitatively or
qualitatively ? Why ?

5. What advantages and disadvantages do you appreciate in secondary research? Ejemplified your
response to the investigation analyzed in 5.3.

3. Analyze the questionnaires of the investigations reviewed in section 5.1. In particular, we focus on
the formulation of the questions : What is the most important thing that calls for the attention of these
questions?

1. Do you consider empirical research useful in the socio- legal field ? Why? Enumerate five themes
or problems related to legal phenomena that can be empirically investigated

6. Is it possible to analyze the incidence of mass media in the context of “ punitive populism”? Seeking
first information on what punitive populism is and, once you have minimally delimited the object and
the objectives of a possible investment, if it could be carried out resorting to the technique of content
analysis . If it is possible, would it be quantitative or qualitative content analysis ? Why ?

4. Information about the procedure for holding a discussion group . What differentiates between the
discussion group and other types of group interviews ? Why in the investigation carried out in section
5.2 is it explicitly stated that the technique employed has consisted of discussion groups ?
