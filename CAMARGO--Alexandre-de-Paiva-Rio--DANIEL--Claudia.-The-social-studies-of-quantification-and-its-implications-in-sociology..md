The social studies of quantification

and its implications in sociology

Claudia Daniel**
Alexandre de Paiva Rio Camargo*

With this objective in mind, this article offers a broad review of the field's
literature, seeking to arouse the interest of the social scientist community for its
heuristic potential. At the same time, an attempt is made to compile the
contributions of social studies from quantification to sociology as a whole. The
first section presents a historical account of the formation of this perspective of
analysis, its main reference works and most significant contributions. The
second section discusses the reasons why we understand that sociology should
broaden its attention to operations and quantification regimes in contemporary
societies. In addition, it examines the contributions that the field has to offer for
reflection on the core issues of the discipline, such as the problem of the
foundations of social order and political authority, the processes of social
differentiation and configuration of subjectivities, social participation, the critique and transformative social agency.

Keywords: sociology of quantification, history of statistics, government of
numbers, population policy, classification categories.

This work has a dual purpose: on the one hand, to present the relevance, scope
and depth of historical and sociological studies on quantification; on the other
hand, to reconstruct the origins of this field and the transformations it has known
over the last few years. Along the way, we are interested in highlighting the links
between the works that analyzed the processes of reasoning, valuing, measuring
and comparing with numbers and the classic and contemporary concerns of sociology.

Directed by Alain Desrosières, this project resulted from the colloquia he

organized in 1976, which brought together several historians of the
Annales, such as Jean-Claude Perrot, Michele Perrot and Jacques Ozouf,

consecrating a pioneering historiographical concern with statistics as a
state instrument of territorial administration and the population.

Alexandre de Paiva Rio Camargo & Claudia Daniel 44

In the 21st century, social studies on quantification extended these

limits a little and (self)identified themselves as those that try to analyze

processes of production and communication of numbers, in general,

understanding quantification as a social phenomenon in itself (Diaz

Bone; Didier, 2016; Espeland; Stevens, 2008). Quantification would no

longer be restricted to the practices of preparing and disseminating

official statistics, but would encompass other operations and calculation

technologies: accounting calculations, cost-benefit analysis, performance

measurements, risk calculations, ratings and rankings. Quantification

is conceived, then, as a fundamental feature of modern social life,

which is evidenced by its close links with scientific activity, consolidation

of modern states, management of complex organizations, evolution of

markets and economic agency. Therefore, it is difficult to think of the

isolated quantification of the questions that sociology has traditionally

formulated about the reproduction of order, cohesion, social

coordination, inequalities, hierarchies, conflicts, individualization and work organization.

1Since studies on quantification are in full expansion, we do not intend to offer
here a completely exhaustive review of the literature, but rather describe an
overview of a set of studies that share certain common assumptions, outlining
their main lines of investigation.

In fact, the recursive effects of numbers on agency and the reality

they describe is one of the main axes of analysis in quantification

studies. The mere existence of the field presupposes overcoming an

old debate in the social sciences, opposing methodological positivists

– who take numerical proof as a coherent and realistic representation

of reality – to theorists and ethnomethodologists – who accuse

numbers of reducing how to how much, omitting or mutilating the

phenomenon to be researched. While the former forget the work of

objectification that surrounds every type of counting, contributing to

mystify its effects of power, the latter ignore that quantification

presupposes a conventional operational definition that gives it a social

force, and that impels a standardized agency (Besson , 1995, p.

25-67). For this reason, statistics must be understood, at the same

time, based on two registers of language about reality, one realistic

(objectivist) and the other relativist (constructivist) – that is, as being

simultaneously conventional and real (Desrosières, 1993 , p. 398).

In the first section of this work, we try to describe how a research

agenda on quantification over time was configured, its theoretical

matrices and most significant contributions. In the second section, we

try to argue why we believe that sociologists should pay more attention

to the different operations and quantification regimes, supporting

ourselves on the idea that the studies carried out so far resume and

illuminate at least three foundational concerns of the sociological

discipline: i ) the issue of the foundations of social order and political

authority in modernity; ii) the issue of social differentiation and the

constitution of subjectivities; iii) the question about the foundations of
criticism and transforming participation in the social world. In the last

section, we develop a reflection summarizing the exposed argument.

Quantification studies: genesis and approaches

2Before that, it is worth noting that, without being articulated in research collectives, a
series of works stand out outside these trajectories, as isolated contributions, which, in
the mid-1970s and early 1980s, germinated the interest and the kind of questioning that
still mobilizes quantification studies. We refer to the work of Michael Cullen (1975), who
analyzes in a historical perspective the development of practices of recording, codification
and enumeration of those who cultivated statistics as an applied science – not linked to
the academic and intellectual community – in Victorian England, and who expanded our
understanding of the process of emergence of statistical reason in modernity. In a similar
direction, the work of Patricia Cohen (1982) focuses on the propensity to count and
measure typical of North American culture, to carry out a historical study on the expansion
of numeracy – or the generation of basic arithmetic skills, such as counting, numbering
and counting . calculate – among the population of the United States during the 18th and
19th centuries, and which resulted in the expansion of the domain of numbers on themes
hitherto thought only in qualitative terms.

As we stated, quantification studies consider statistical measurement

practices and other quantification operations as a valid object of research.

This presupposes recognizing the irremediably social character of the

actions that contribute (and have contributed) to the mise en nombre

of the world, transforming into quantities what until then was only thought of

in terms of qualities. Starting from this common platform, we can group most

of the most influential studies aligned with this perspective into two

fundamental strands: on the one hand, the French current , which was

formed at the intersection between the socio-history of statistics and the

sociology of science; the economy of conventions and the sociology of

criticism; on the other hand, the Anglo-Saxon current, linked – as we have

already mentioned – to historical epistemology, the Anglo-Foucauldians and
the Department of Accounting and Finance at the London School of

Economics. We will examine these traditions in the following pages.2
As a starting point, we can say that the field adopted the
constructivist lexicon and vocabulary of the new French sociologies
of the 1980s-2000s (Corcuff, 2015). It is a sociology clearly heir to
the critical sociology of Pierre Bourdieu, who promoted not only the
use of statistics in the social sciences, but also an accurate

reflection on the practices that presided over their elaboration. Bourdieu (2007)

One of the peculiarities of the French tradition of research in the
history and sociology of statistics is that it originated in the national
institute of statistics in that country, the Institut National de la Statistique
et des Études Économiques – INSEE (Didier, 2016). Hence, between
the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, the first studies on
the socio-professional categories officially employed in France emerged,
which were analyzed from a diachronic and synchronic perspective,
seeking to understand the mechanisms of categorization, with special
attention to the processes of codification. Inspired by the economy of
conventions, in particular the notion of plurality of logics of action, such
works sought to show how classification categories adhere to the
judgments and typifications that ordinary people make in different
situations of everyday life (Boltanski, 1982; Desrosières ; Thévenot, 1988; Boltanski; Thévenot, 1991).

Since then, the perceptive historical readings of Alain Desrosières
and his successive contributions to the study of a language – statistics
– which, for him, combined the authorities of science and the State,
paved the way for the understanding of statistics as outil de preuve and
outil of gouvernement, two poles in permanent articulation. As numerical
evidence, statistics serves to describe reality and, as such, is an

indisputable reference that precedes debates. In turn, as a State activity,
statistics serves to prescribe and act on this very reality and, as such, is
the target of denunciation and deconstruction of the pyramid of

equivalences that sustain social distinction. In his major work, La
politique des grands nombres (1993), Desrosières sought to reconcile
the apparent divorce between the cognitive and political histories of
statistics, a discipline whose meaning and content were changing
between the 18th and 21st centuries.

it bequeathed a quantitative sociology centered on issues of reproduction
of inequalities and relations of domination between social classes,
apprehended in its conceptual terms of habitus and field. This option
demanded a critical reflection of the official nomenclatures, which would
be carried out by his disciples.

Then, this author adopted the term quantification, conceiving it as

the synthesis of two moments – that of agreeing (convenir) and that of

measuring (mesurer) –, starting to focus on the examination of the

constraints, procedures and social and political effects of quantification.

The methodological realism followed by this tradition introduces the

social at the heart of the logic of metrology, dispelling the impression that

the conventions of statistical forms are arbitrary (Desrosières, 2008). The

real cannot be denied by an absolute constructivism, in which the

measure totally creates the object. Conversely, the role of quantification

in the government of people and things cannot be denied “by an absolute

realism, in which things would have a prior existence independent of their measure”

(Armatte, 2014, p. 22).

In this way, they offer an empirical approach to the capillarized

character of government in modern societies, through the notion of

government at a distance, which they also applied to the politics of

numbers (Rose, 1999). In this context, certain calculation instruments

come to be examined in terms of “government technologies”, that is, as

mechanisms through which government programs become operational
(Miller, 2001; Miller; Power, 2013).

In the Anglo-Saxon field, the sociology of quantification was

nourished by contributions from governmentality studies carried out
mainly in the United Kingdom and Australia. Postulating a style of

analysis, more than a theoretical model, the works of Rose and Miller

(1992), Rose (1999), Miller (2001), Burchell, Gordon and Miller (1991)

and Dean (1999) seek to explain the forms of rationality underlying

different regimes of government, in order to demonstrate the connections
between the ways in which we know ourselves and are led to know

ourselves, and the ways in which we govern ourselves and are governed
in the present. His works explore the resonances between Michel

Foucault's (2008; 2009) latest reflections on population management and
other intellectual projects, such as Bruno Latour's actor-network theory (2000).

A few years later, Theodore Porter's (1995) work, Trust in
numbers, shifted the focus from science and state administration to
the role of quantification in applied fields. Porter showed that the diffusion

Accounting, for example, was recognized as one of the preeminent
instruments of modern quantification, as a device that allows
acting on the lives of individuals and inducing appropriate behaviors
to certain economic objectives. Accounting practices require and
inspire particular forms of organization, being linked to a strategic or
programmatic ambition – to increase efficiency, foster responsibility,
improve decision-making, increase competitiveness –, but
fundamentally provide a means of acting on the individuals in order
to influence their conduct, without losing their “freedom” of choice.
Thus, accounting calculation practices , like other quantification tools,
promote the government of individuals, inducing them to think of
themselves as calculating selves (Miller, 2001).

The work of two graduates of the aforementioned group from
Bielefeld and exponents of the Anglo-Saxon tradition deserves
special attention. The precursor works of the epistemologist Ian
Hacking on the emergence and expansion of statistical reasoning
rescued Foucault's concept of biopolitics, but focusing on an aspect
little developed by the French philosopher – statistics. In the field of
science, the erosion of determinism and the introduction of chance,
even if “tamed” by calculation, boosted statistical rationality , a
process followed in terms of State institutionality by the proliferation
of data-producing agencies throughout Europe. The “avalanche of
printed numbers” produced by these agencies, throughout the first
half of the 19th century, promoted the formation of new categories of
classification of people, in response to the need to uniformly count
and number the population that was intended to govern (Hacking,
1982; 1990). A historical process that will also result in the
establishment of the idea of normality as a key concept for understanding social behavior.

Such antecedents inspired new perspectives on quantification at the

turn of the century. The research agenda was expanded with the

introduction of the analysis of reactivity (reactivity) generated by statistical

measurements (Espeland; Sauder, 2007; Espeland; Stevens, 2008) as a

way to recognize the reflexivity (and not the mere passivity) of the actors

that are the object of the measurements, the feedback effects (feedback

loops) and the performativity (performativity) of the statistics, in terms of

their ability to affect the reality that the numbers do not just describe or reflect.

The development – for many years in parallel – of the two currents

or “traditions” mentioned here resulted in the illumination of the social

and politico-cognitive dimensions of numbers, statistical objects and the

categories of thought they propose. Detachment from classical

epistemology, added to a conventionalist approach, opened up the

possibility of investigating the choices, assumptions, agreements and

commitments that are at the origin of every statistical measurement device.

In this sense, we can identify a first step taken by all this literature,

aiming to recover historicity, in order to break with the perception of

numbers as simple technical objects – strongly related to the ideals of

precision, objectivity or neutrality – and reveal their conventional

character. The second step consisted in making visible the different

social and political effects produced by numbers in modern societies.

Thus, since the 19th century, competing professional groups have

resorted to numbers to consolidate their position in the division of labor,

producing new quantification devices and applying them to hitherto

incommensurable domains, such as the calculation of insurance, in the

hands of actuaries, and the cost-benefit analysis, pioneered by engineers.

the statistical reason depended on the growing importance of mechanical

objectivity in science and public life, that is, on the systematic preference

for standardized analytical protocols and techniques over professional

judgment based on practice, training, and personal experience.

Between the 1990s and the early 2000s, the varied range of case
studies (Anderson, 1988; Beaud; Prévost, 1997; Blum; Mespoulet, 2003;
Curtis, 2001; Loveman, 2009; Otero, 2006; Patriarca , 1996, among

others), the strongly empirical character and socio-historical perspective
of many of these works were fundamental in proving the hypothesis –
central to sociology– that statistics contribute to establishing social reality
before reflecting it. This aspect draws attention to the particular importance
of the historical and historiographical approach in the affirmation of a
relativist and constructivist perspective on a frontier object such as
statistics.

Thus, the very productive rapprochement between history and
sociology seems to us to be a characteristic that is at the genesis of the
field, and which translates the multidisciplinary character of its object. Not
by chance, a large number of its authors have dual training and/or work at
the interface between history and social sciences. In this sense, sociologists
found the debate about the performative and recursive nature of numbers
already fermented by these works of sociohistory and historical sociology,
when they started to be more directly interested in ways of quantifying and
inducing social agency in neoliberalism.

This is a new quantification regime, which is just beginning to be
problematized by the social sciences, attracting increasing attention
(Espeland; Stevens, 2008).

The reflective and critical effects of the historical approach to
statistics as an object of study, which lies at the origin of the field, have
expanded the explanatory potential of more recent analyzes on
quantification in present-day societies. From the 2000s onwards, new
research topics were incorporated, such as performance measurements
or evaluations, rankings (Espeland; Sauder, 2007), benchmarking
(Bruno; Didier, 2013; Fougner , 2008) and the politics of Big Data (Rouvroy, 2014; 2016).

focused on as a mediating element of the most different cultural

practices, a foundational cognitive process, a constitutive phenomenon

of all social life, as demonstrated by the pioneering work of Thomas

Crump (1990). Numerical forms matter here in their convergence with

secular and spiritual powers, the emotional states of ordinary people,

and the experience of the transcendent. Numerology, gambling,

accounting and probability appear interconnected, in their ability to

mobilize, to calculate the occurrence of auspicious events, to compute

the debts and merits of members of a religious community, but also to

inform bets, lotteries and investment strategies. Anthropology rescues

the magical character of the numbers that populate the modern and

contemporary world, which is found in the arbitration of risks and

uncertainties in finance, in the calculation of compensation due to

victims, in the intended equivalence between crime or offense, on the

one hand , and punishment, amnesty and conciliation, on the other

(Guyer et al., 2010, p. 36-61). While sociology, solidly anchored in a

historical sensitivity, calls into question the ways in which we govern

ourselves through numbers and alternative ways of quantifying reality,

works guided by ethnography are interested in the ways of inhabiting a world apprehended numerically.

Some scholars describe quantification studies as a vibrant

others refer to it as a transdisciplinary scientific movement or an

strengthen and acquire new forms in the present, accompanying the

transformations suffered by the regime of capitalist accumulation, starting

in the 1970s. The strong tendency towards financialization, the profusion

of neoliberal modes of government, the development of information and

communication technologies further stimulated academic interest in

quantification. At the same time, exchanges between specialists from

different latitudes have enriched the theoretical perspective, in such a

way that the conceptual toolbox for the empirical investigation of

quantification has been greatly expanded (Espeland; Stevens, 2008; Mennicken; Espeland, 2019).

We consider that sociology should not leave numbers out of its

powerful dereification lenses since, as Espeland and Stevens (2008, p.

433) suggest, “numbers are strongly implicated in the central questions

that cross the discipline”. Both the historical research reviewed above

and the most recent sociological contributions converge in pointing out

that statistics affect the way we perceive and interpret reality; how we

classify and value others, ourselves, and shared situations; they intervene

when we consider our options, decide and act, alone or in interrelationship

with others; they make power relations operable and mediate the

maintenance of – or resistance to – forms of domination. Therefore, we

4Paul Starr proposed a research program on the social and cognitive structure of statistical
systems (Alonso; Starr, 1987, p. 8-9). The social structure would correspond to the social
relations between informants, state agencies, private companies, professional bodies and
international associations involved in the production networks and uses of statistics. The
cognitive structure, in turn, would consist of the determinants of the production and readability
of the numbers: the links between the design of the questionnaires, the assumptions made
about social reality, the classification principles, the measurement methods and the norms of
interpretation and data presentation.

From its origins, social studies of quantification have drawn attention to

and social domination. While Foucauldian approaches analyzed the production

of spaces and subjects of government through numbers, authors linked to

pragmatic sociology, especially Desrosières and his followers, understood

quantification as a system of conventions and a coordination tool.

Authors within the theoretical framework of governmentality studies, such

as Nikolas Rose, Peter Miller and Mitchell Dean, dedicated themselves to

analyzing the constitutive link between the quantification of public life and the

liberal government. The numbers would be presented as an instrument of

realization of the democratic promise of aligning the exercise of public authority

with the private beliefs and values of the citizens.

On the one hand, the numbers put a brake on the discretionary power of

government officials and specialists, by forcing political choices and bureaucratic

decisions to be subject to protocols that make them appear to be products of

standardized analytical techniques. On the other hand, “democratic government

requires vigilant and calculating citizens in relation to the effects of power and

the risks of their private decisions”, constantly affected by opinion and market

surveys, which shift and quantify perceptions of reality (Rose, 1999 , pp.

197-198). The growing quantification of the contemporary world would be a

phenomenon to be understood by two complementary dimensions that

characterize the government of modern societies: the

From the Foucaultian (2008; 2009) and Latourian (2000)
perspective, maps, cartograms, censuses and statistics are approached
as technologies of government at a distance, because they respect the
autonomy of private spheres and suggest appropriate behaviors to
particular conceptions of individual well-being and collective. In this
register, statistics would be a liberal technology of government, because
it proceeds by the delimitation of authority and the codification of
domains of society, with their own economic processes and dynamics
of cohesion, populated by individuals who act according to certain
principles of interest, outside the legitimate scope of a direct intervention.
Statistics is seen here as a device for transferring governmental activity
to the surface of society, by structuring the field of possible actions, and
“providing actors with norms and standards for their own judgments,
aspirations and conduct” (Rose, 1999, p. 48-49).

These are issues sensitive to governmentality studies, but also to
studies of quantification, insofar as they privilege the material, visual and
spatial dimension of government, and call attention to the cartography of
power and authority. It is assumed that the success of a government
regime depends on how actors experience themselves through the
capabilities (such as making rational decisions), qualities (such as having
a job) and status (such as being an active citizen) encouraged and favored
by it ( Dean, 1999, p. 32).

Like Foucault, its authors linked public numbers to liberal and neoliberal
governmentality, leaving aside the variations between statistical techniques
and their correspondence with different modalities of criticism of reality,
precisely what interested Desrosières and the French pragmatists (DiazBone
; Didier, 2016, p. 15).

In this sense, some heuristic questions become sociologically relevant
for us to think about the relationship between quantification, domination
and coordination: what can be visualized or, conversely, what remains
obscure in certain moments or societies, when we look at devices such as
censuses, maps, charts, tables and diagrams that form the visual field on
what and who should be governed? How does statistics produce
government subjects – from workers and consumers to the so-called risk
groups? How do the numbers suggest or induce their expected abilities?
How are individuals and populations led to identify with certain groups, in
order to become virtuous and governable?

Despite the fruitfulness of this theoretical perspective, evident for
thinking the relationship between State, population and statistics as a
governmental trinomial (Camargo, 2016), its radical constructivism does
not take into account statistical science and its role in the coordination of social life .

States, the market and the economic agency. In this sense, the
relationship between statistical science – as an indisputable reference
that precedes debates – and the national traditions of statistical
systems was originally suggested as a research program. Although it
has remained somewhat fluid and little theorized, the proposal to
approach statistics “between universal science and national

“equivalence conditions” for a basis of comparative studies on quantification.
In the 1990s and 2000s, in the wake opened by Desrosières, a
series of works thematized the relationships between, on the one hand,
the spread of statistical internationalism, pushing for the normalization
of classifications, measurement instruments and population counting
infrastructure – , and, on the other hand, the historical conformation of
national statistical practices, whose profile is inseparable from the
genealogy of States and local structures of domination. Years later,
this proposal was expanded to a comparative analysis of statistical
experiences in Europe, the United States and Canada (Beaud; Prévost,
2000) and, later, also in Latin America (Senra; Camargo, 2010; Otero, 2018).
Among the questions shared by these works, we find: the methods
used in the censuses of the 19th and 20th centuries, the ways of
presenting numerical information and its role in movements for
construction and reform of the State; the institutions and actors who
used statistics as a source of authority and intervention in social
debates; the role of quantification technologies in the construction of
science practices and audiences ; the importance of ways of reasoning
and valuing with numbers for the formation of a capitalist economic
ethos and for the modernization of labor relations. These and other
questions gave an identity and a common interest to the social
historians of statistics, who thus managed to partially overcome their
initial dispersion, drawing attention to the conditions of comparability,
given the national differences in the modes of production and circulation of quantified objects.

Thus, census technologies and population and production
statistics would adjust to the needs of the “engineering State”; price
statistics based on classical economic theory accompany the
“liberal state”; labor statistics, budget surveys of working-class
families, probability calculation techniques for determining social
security are at the base of the political rationality of the “Providential
State”; national accounting, research on consumption and
employment and econometric techniques respond to the needs of the “Keynesian State”.

As a result of the historical reconstruction of official statistical systems

– or “national traditions” – the perspective also made it possible to highlight
the relationship between socially relevant issues, which were placed on
the public policy agenda at different historical moments, and the statistical
tools created to objectify such issues, give them legibility and, thus, delimit
areas of government action, with the purpose of acting on them. In this
sense, the themes and limits of official statistical investigations would be
reflecting the contours of the political agenda at every moment. In addition
to the use – so common nowadays – of social indicators in the different
stages of the cycle of formulating and evaluating public policies,
Desrosières' proposal (1993) showed the profound interdependence
between the ways of statistically objectifying reality and the institutional
forms to manage it. The categories of statistical description are entangled
in the modalities of State action.

In L'État, le marché et les statistiques (2003), Desrosières would
redefine that program by conceiving the concept of “political regimes of
statistics”, identifying five ideal types of State, based on their relationship
with the economy and economic conduct . In this way, he sought to
demonstrate the associations between ways of quantifying and ways of governing.

Due to the limits of this article, we cannot dwell on its examination, but

a few words are in order about benchmarking, this specific art of conducting

organizations that, over the last few years, under the influence of the New

Public Management paradigm, migrated from the scope from companies and

private businesses to the administration of the States. Unlike official statistics,

benchmarking is not intended to reflect and transform a reality conceived as

objective and external.

Following the crisis of the two previous and intertwined models, the
“neoliberal State” puts an end to forecasting and planning techniques
based on macroeconomic knowledge, in favor of the generalization of
benchmarking techniques , which rest on the principle of rational
anticipations and the promotion of competition between the actors,
according to measurable goals and objectives, no longer according to the
concrete relationships in which they take part (Armatte, 2014, p. 21).
In one of his last articles, Le rôle du nombre dans le gouvernement
de la cité neolibérale (2011), Desrosières' model is significantly

sophisticated, with the incorporation of the notion of governmentality,
in part a reflection of the late publication of Foucault's courses in the
College de France. In it, Desrosières develops the central hypothesis
that the feedback of indicators on the behavior of actors ceases to be
the unforeseen effect of quantification techniques and becomes the
purpose of the political rationality of neoliberalism. This idea quickly
awakens the attention of many social scientists attracted by its
explanatory value and by the proliferation of contemporary forms of
quantification, especially big data and benchmarking, responsible for
the rapid expansion known in the field in recent years.

to the subjects, but modifying the behavior of the organizations' own
actors in the course of the action, promoting a self-referential look at
themselves, detached from the social relations in which they take part.
This is because the indicators selected as references in the comparisons
depend on the agents themselves to quantify and monitor their activities.

To end this section, we point out some background trends.

Sociologias, Porto Alegre, year 23, n. 56, Jan-Apr 2021, p. 42-81.

The very different origins and perspectives of the two great traditions of the
field – French and Anglo-Saxon – have not prevented them from meeting
in recent years, with the generalization of the concept of neoliberal
governmentality, understood as a way of managing and quantifying the population.

The prerogative of evaluators to evaluate themselves is presented as an
advantage, an anti-bureaucratic weapon, since employees gain a significant
margin of initiative, “supposedly freeing themselves from the shackles of
hierarchy and the formalism of regulations” (Bruno; Didier, 2013, p . 17-27).

Another important aspect, Alain Desrosières can be considered the
main mediator of the two great moments in the development of the field.
By placing statistics between science (outil de preuve) and national
traditions (outil de gouvernement), he reduced the dispersion of hitherto
existing historical studies and provided subsidies for comparative research,
based on common assumptions. Years later, his project

On the one hand, being public (or publicized), measures of quantified
activities constrain those responsible to make an effort to avoid the
humiliation of bad results. On the other hand, each action to be taken is

judged in terms of failure to stigmatize or success to be rewarded, which
has the effect of “disengaging public agents from society as a whole and
emptying the perception of their social function” (Bruno; Didier, 2013 , p.
51). According to these authors, by resorting to the incessant quantification
of all activities according to the imperatives of “total quality” and
“international competitiveness”, benchmarking “subjects individuals to an
indefinite discipline, designed to guide their engagement in action and to
govern the what is most personal: his initiatives” (p. 120).

of relating ways of quantifying to ways of governing would appeal to social
scientists, interested in generalizing quantification to levels of agency and
domains of social life that were previously incommensurable.
As we have seen, statistics studies began with a strong historiographical

vocation, relating the elaboration of numbers to state-building processes ,
the creation of images and representations of the nation. Even more, they
formulated questions such as the construction of authority and the
foundations of the legitimacy of the State's statistical services. Today, the
State is just one of several organizations that promote government based
on measurements and numbers, whether on a national or global scale.
There is a growing role for international organizations (United Nations,
World Bank, OECD), non-governmental organizations (in defense of human
rights and the environment, in the fight against poverty and in favor of

transparency) and transnational think tanks , together with actors that we
could call private. Among the latter, risk assessment agencies, the World
Economic Forum and the International Institute for Management
Development (Fougner, 2008) stand out, whose role in developing indices,
rankings and all types of numerical information caught the attention of
social scientists. , marking a new trend in studies on quantification.

Understanding the specificities of the exercise of power through
numbers in the contemporary world involves highlighting this variety of
actors with recognized reputation, central to the establishment of new
modes of global and local governance, capable of concealing normative
agendas under technical languages of neutral evaluation. .6 In parallel with
the displacement of the State by the progressive “competence” of these
actors in the elaboration of indices and rankings, the current scenario is
crossed by a rapid process of privatization of data production, which,

the generation of this data, allowing them to bypass justification requirements

Quantify, classify and “invent” people

7In the original: “enumeration demands kinds of things or people to count. Counting is hungry
for categories. Many of the categories we now use to describe people are byproducts of the
needs of enumeration”.

According to Ian Hacking (1991), statistical language promoted a
set of classifications through which people thought (and still think) about
themselves. The vast accumulation of official data in Europe throughout
the 19th century provided the empirical corpus on which this author
based his concept of “dynamic nominalism” and which allowed him to
illustrate the social process he called making up people – or “modeling of people”.

In print, in the mid-nineteenth century, statistical bureaucrats established
a series of classifications for counting, which allowed them to group
people, classify them, and code them. The invention of categories in
which each person could (and should) fit in was, at the same time, a way
of managing and of strengthening the new concepts about the human
being. The creation of these categories gave rise to other ways of
conceiving people. Thus, for example, the classification according to
aptitude for work, originally designed by factory inspectors, will be
assimilated by the census on a population scale, consecrating a principle
of categorization based on the role played by individuals in production
relations. An innovation that helped institute the structure of occupations
and classes, guiding the terms in which we see society and situate
ourselves in relation to it.

counted. The count is thirsty for categories. Many of the categories we
use today to describe people are derived from enumeration needs”7

Anchored in their national statistical traditions, and through the new

power to officially classify all inhabitants of a given territory, statisticians
generated descriptions of the populations that would come to shape its
“national character”. For Hacking, the ways of describing people are not
alien to them, but rather constitute them, as they delimit the field of
possibilities of their personality.

Counting the population in order to build subject positions and thus
solidify identities that are more real than others – traditional, family, local,
regional – involved attributing legal and symbolic effects to categories that
diluted individualities into individualizations. In this perspective, the “mother
tongue” reflects less the language of the individual than the language of
the nation to which he belongs and through which he perceives himself.
Similarly, “ethnic origin” in western immigrant countries “has more to do
with the presumption of belonging to another country of origin, not with the
feeling of belonging” (Kertzer; Arel, 2002, p. 27). In this sense, the census
appears alongside other state registries created to establish a monopoly
on legitimate means of mobility and endow categories with symbolic
efficacy, such as, for example, the use of identity documents to guarantee
transit and distinguish citizens from foreigners. , or the nationals of the
colonial subjects.

Census categorization, in its relation to national statistical traditions,
was the subject of a series of studies focused on the processes of
ethnicization and racialization of populations. These are works that
addressed censuses as a fundamental instrument for constructing and
legitimizing national and (post)colonial identity. For this literature, censuses
allow States to produce, represent and monitor collective identities and,
thus, regulate the conflicts and social pressures that constitute public life
(Kertzer; Arel, 2002).

Another important point highlighted by this literature is that the
ascription of legal and symbolic effects to census categories contributed to
establishing the statistical conception of normality as recurrence, which
reduces differences between individuals to a matter of measurement, according to the

Machine Translated by Google

From 1890 on, this classification became more sophisticated, subdividing

mulattoes into quadroons and octoroons, according to the atavistic fraction of

In her social history of the US census, Margo Anderson (1988) showed
how the secession war was built on a growing polarization , which had
numbers as the common referent of conflicting points of view . In the
1850 census, the desire of southern politicians to statistically demonstrate
the superior longevity of the servile stratum, in relation to free blacks in
the North, gave rise to a tripartite racial division – whites, blacks and
mulattos –, which instituted the polygenist notion of population – until
then considered a crime by religion –, while subordinated the colored
groups in number and condition, condemning them to the rapid absorption
by the white race. This system was designed to control the black
population as a whole – not just those who came from captivity – and
biologically isolate a white majority enlarged by immigration (Nobles, 2000).

On the other hand, the conception of normality as recurrence subtly
invites individuals to see themselves through statistical categories, either
by reinforcing the stigma produced by the racialized geography of the
State (by gender, color, language and ethnicity), or, more recently, by
denouncing the domination by challenging classification criteria,
redefining their uses and contents.

average and the distribution of the normal curve (Hacking, 1990; Carson,
2006). On the one hand, even the identities of “deviant” and racialized

individuals become scalable, since it opens up the possibility (albeit
hypothetical) that the performance of subclassified groups rises to that
of the upper stratum, considered normative, which authorizes interventions
more or less violent on their living and socialization conditions. These

groups will be the most susceptible to markedly biopolitical population
management strategies (Camargo, 2016).

Some works addressed the relationship between racial categorization
and the construction of the State itself. Let us think, for example, of the
case of the United States, where the statistical comparison between free
and slave, black and white, helped to crystallize the image of a divided country.

laboratory for the pioneering introduction of an anthropological and
biological conception of the population, even before scientific racism and
social theory formalized some of its categories as explanatory concepts
of social change (Schor, 2003).

Another research group is situated within the framework of
postcolonial studies , having examined the role of censuses in the setting
up of the colonial enterprise and in national liberation movements.
Following the path opened by Benedict Anderson (2008), these are
works that explored the technological intersections between censuses
and maps, in order to underpin the territoriality of the colonial State, fix
its borders, prevent conflicts and distribute bureaucracy, remodeling the
pre-existing ethnoracial hierarchy and thus modifying the terrain on which
colonized populations live, feel and act (Scott, 1995; Chatterjee, 2004; Legg, 2006).
In this mode of use, statistics would be strategic in overcoming local
topography, which classified towns, markets and settlements according
to their insertion in cultural traditions and religious stories. Such spaces,
segmented for centuries , would be configured and reconfigured through
censuses and maps, being rebuilt as territorially solid units and

Statistics became a means of recognizing the identity and
numerical importance of groups (ethnic, racial, gender, etc.) before
the State. For this reason, certain social groups became interested
in being counted and began to demand that public authorities and
institutionalized statistical systems register and produce data that
would make their groups visible in the public sphere. Racial and
ethnic minorities, national collectivities and religious communities
mobilized and publicly expressed their intention to participate in
statistical and/or census definitions.

From this angle, the history of statistics has shown how official
categories contribute to dividing groups within a population,
separating them and ordering them in codified hierarchies. Statistics
not only establish these social divisions, they also fix these categories
of people, even when the boundaries of groups are not clearly
defined in social life (Alonso; Starr, 1987). In grouping work, official
statistics can bring together people who, until then, were not
considered part of the same category. Once subordinated to a
common administrative and statistical status, it may also happen
that their interests complement or combine. In this sense, as Starr
said, official classifications not only register, but also rewrite the lines
of social differentiation.

On the other hand, we should note that, as indicated above,
studies of quantification are heirs to the concern with the ways in
which devices allow shaping and influencing people's behavior and
act as “technologies of the self”. Continuing with analyzes of
disciplined subjectivity (Rose, 1996), some scholars have explored
the more recent phenomenon of the increasingly diffuse penetration
of quantification into everyday life, its expansion into personal life,
and its influence on the configuration of the quantified- self (Nafus, 2016). The new technologies

Quantify, resist and criticize

For these approaches, it is clear that devices that quantify the
self are intended to actively influence the behavior they track.
Likewise , digitized metrics lead to new and varied schemes for
classifying individuals, which are used by companies and
corporations to create markets – for example, markets for credit or
insurance, health, education, among others. – which in turn affects
their chances and quality of life. In this sense, it is also evident here
that the States and their official classifications tend to lose
protagonism in the 21st century, while new quantification devices,
created and disseminated by other actors become available –
platform companies and social networks, financial companies,
agencies national and international credit institutions,
transnational foundations, etc. capable of molding and managing new subjectivities.

Although statistics have a long history of articulation with the
State, in its claim to control populations and exercise domination, it
is no less true that they have been linked to social reform (Cullen,
1975) and associated with denunciations of injustice, arbitrariness
and social inequalities (Bruno; Didier; Previeux, 2014; Bruno; Didier;
Vitale, 2014). As Desrosières (2014) highlighted, there is another
history of the uses of statistics as an instrument of social criticism.
While historical approaches related statistics to the exercise of
power, favoring the pole of dominant groups, more recent studies
have focused on statistics as a tool that enhances political action
and criticism of reality, emphasizing the agency capacity of social
actors, including subordinate groups, who also appropriate them to
resist and try to reverse power relations.

From a theoretical point of view, it is important to emphasize that this is
an innovation inspired by the economy of conventions. The concept consists
of a piece from the French intellectual field, after consecrating the passage
from the critical sociology of Pierre Bourdieu to the sociology of criticism (or
pragmatic sociology) of Boltanski and Thévenot. In Sociologie de la critique,
Boltanski proposes a distinction between what he calls reality, which “tends to
be confused with what seems to maintain itself by its own strength”, that is,
with order, and, on the other hand, the world , the flow of events and

combines a wide variety of militant and political action practices with numbers,
and which has in common “the willingness to put statistics at the service of
political emancipation” (Bruno; Didier; Previeux, 2014, p. 27). The last few
years have witnessed the emergence of new social movements, as centers of
resistance to the expansion of the means of quantification embraced by
neoliberalism, which led these authors to formulate this descriptive concept –
and, at the same time, optimistic –, capable of encompassing an activism
social plural that is expressed through the language of statistics.

One of the most important contributions of this literature was to show
that, in addition to the authority of numbers being based on the intended
objectivity and impartiality of techniques, and despite the fact that one of the
great promises of modern statistics is the depoliticization of politics, numbers
can be repoliticized in different ways. ways. A set of works has drawn attention
to the renewed role that quantification assumes in the organization of political
activism, social movements and various types of protests (Bruno; Didier;
Previeux, 2014; Bruno; Didier; Vitale, 2014; Didier; Tasset , 2013). Activists
from the most diverse causes resorted to statistical arguments and appropriated

numerical information as a means of denouncing and criticizing the powerful.
These situations demonstrated that quantification is not always, nor naturally,
an instrument for imposing the interests of the elites – economic, technical
and political –, or of those who are at the head of large organizations, whether
public or private, national or transnational. It can also be a valuable tool for
undermining authority and confronting institutionalized powers.

It depends on the precision of the critical instruments, as well as the solidity
of institutions and networks that support the numbers: “the success of social
criticism expressed in statistical language cannot be based merely on the
correctness of the arguments, but depends, to a large extent, on the political
and social network in which it is inserted” (Desrosières, 2014, p. 357).8

experiences, the possibility of which is not contained in the known totality
(Boltanski, 2009, p. 93). In this approach, statistics is conceived as an
institutional form that calls reality into question and paves the way for the
world. In this way, the demand that sociology addresses modes of
government and their investment in statistical forms, as well as critical
operations involving different social actors, is justified .
As Bruno and Didier's article in this dossier argues, the most recent
research within this line of analysis has demonstrated that, both throughout
history and today, statactivism has spread across different fields and with
varying scope. In some cases, experiences of statistical activism consisted
merely of denouncing the flaws, gaps or limitations of public statistics.

Sometimes, it took the form of activism in favor of official statistics, taking

into account aspects of reality hitherto neglected, denouncing the priorities

established by measurement regimes, and highlighting the relevance of
elements neglected by quantification practices. In other cases, an attempt
was made to expose the internal contradictions of a statistical system or to
expose the prejudices on which it is based, to show that statistics do not
have the neutrality or impartiality that many claim.

Among the statactivist practices is the elaboration of alternative
indicators to the official ones as a source of political interventions, and
as a statistical counter-discourse that allows the state's power of naming
and describing reality to be confronted, to show a reality different from
the official one. However, it is worth noting, with Desrosières (2014), that
the success of a critical undertaking of this type is never guaranteed in advance.

Statistical activism would be a step towards emancipation from the

authority of official statistics, with a view to reclaiming the authority that

such devices are capable of conferring on arguments in favor of the group
whose interests this activism represents. This process ends up promoting
the repoliticization of statistics.

Various political groupings have aspired and still aspire to free themselves
from relationships of subordination or struggle to reverse the conditions of
inequality to which they are subjected. This is the case of Hispanics in the
United States (Nobles, 2000), American indigenous peoples, religious
minorities, among many others who sought to institutionalize themselves
statistically in order to gain social recognition, translate their moral greatness
into size and political weight, in a way to strengthen the legitimacy of their demands.

But numbers, figures and indicators are not just political resources in
the struggle for recognition led by previously organized minorities.

In today's world, there are several networks for using numbers involving
human rights associations and NGOs that produce and use original data on
violence against minorities, helping to consolidate them as social categories.
Studying one of these networks, Eugenia de Rosa (2014) showed how
figures on violence are used in four phases of mobilizing public opinion by
the gender equality movement: in the framing and categorization process,
in the design and implementation of policies, in dissemination and
awareness campaigns, and monitoring fluctuations. Throughout these four
phases, networks of use provide consistency to the social aggregates that
statistics allow us to establish.

Another type of statactivism lies in the public denunciation of
subjects or social groups made invisible or hidden by official statistics;

This type of statistical activism presupposes the intervention
of actors, both subjects and objects of measurement instruments,
based on the convenient use of rules to influence their results.

– the rules involved in performance evaluations, which oblige

directly influencing the formation of a new “statistical community” ,
which saw itself for the first time as a political group, organized on
the basis of a shared culture and identity, which would soon give
way to the rights movement (Michaels; Espeland, 2006). Therefore,

Although there were already several historical experiences of
statistical activism, neoliberal governmentality produced specific
conditions for the emergence of new ways of fighting numbers. By
following Bruno, Didier and Previeux (2014), the notion of statactivisme
acquires a particular meaning as a means of opposition to neoliberal
forms of government. In the contemporary world, statactivist practices
fundamentally consist in highlighting the rules for producing indicators,
rankings and targets that integrate the political rationality of
neoliberalism; benchmarking as a global government technology; and
the managerial techniques currently applied in public and private
organizations, especially taking advantage of the margins of freedom that such rules leave to agents.

by numbers, promoted through the application of “transparent”, “objective”
and “neutral” technical tools. As highlighted by Didier and Tasset (2013),
“quantifying is producing knowledge and, therefore, acquiring power.
Therefore, it is a precious weapon that we can reuse.”9 Statistics can be

social conflicts.

that there are more radical modalities, others more reformist, and even

statistics and forms of violence. Take as an example the profound social

conflict that occurred in Guadeloupe – a small archipelago in the Antilles
that constitutes an overseas region of France due to the increase in the cost
of living, in 2009, when numbers were involved in serious social tension.
According to a study by Samuel (2014), statistics appeared both as
mediation support for explosive popular reactions, and as tools of intimidation
and coercion, leading to an escalation of violence.

In this way, it contributes to triggering protest actions against the methods
of 'government by numbers', motivating confrontations with the State and
dominant actors” (Samuel, 2014, p. 254). In addition to exceptional situations
like this, statistical arguments often appear in political conflict scenarios as
a principle of evidence to erode authority.

9In the original: “quantifier, c'est produire du savoir, donc acquérir du pouvoir. C’est donc une
arme précieuse dont nous pouvons nous ressaisir”.
10As Desrosières (2014) pointed out, criticism can be “reformist” and rely on “unquestionable
numbers” or, on the contrary, more or less “radical”, and reject the calculations and tools
used, or disqualify the mere use of them . The counterpoint between reformist and radical
statactivism was also addressed by Didier and Tasset (2013).

In short, there are many reasons that justify greater attention to
statistics as a political argument and as a tool for political action. What
role do numbers play in formulating and framing a public discussion?
What types of social criticism do they enable, restrict or strengthen? How
did numbers transform the way actors engaged in politics? What specific
effects do statistics produce when associated with social protests? How
and under what circumstances can a persuasive device like statistics
become a support for threat or coercion? To what extent does
quantification promote or block democratic participation? Reflection on
the intervention of statistical language in political debates and social
disputes, its implications and effects are of great relevance for
understanding the dynamics of contemporary societies.

As we seek to demonstrate in this article, quantification practices
deserve to be part of a legitimate research agenda in the social sciences.
If we agree that quantification is both a knowledge and a government
tool (Desrosières, 2008), its sociological investigation is not only relevant,
but necessary. But why is a sociological reading of numbers so essential?

Different empirical and theoretical research that we review here
have shown that quantification operations are constitutive of social relations,

public, as a resource in the dispute between political factions for access
to government leadership, or as an instrument for mediating redistributive
social conflicts (Hayes, 2011). On certain occasions, statactivism adopts
another mode of expression, when the use of statistics against government
authority involves the mobilization of a conservative critique in its
foundations, which essentially accepts, sanctions and reinforces the
established modes of quantification, restoring the conventions on which
the measurement was based (Daniel; Lanata Briones, 2019).

not just derived from them; that is, they are intrinsic to themselves,
not secondary. Through the objects produced by quantification
(numbers, indicators, rankings, series, graphs, tables) and the
relationships they establish – between people, and
between people and things, ways of exercising power. Quantification
affects the way we perceive and construct social reality, the way we
evaluate our actions and those of others, how we consider our options
and objectives, how we manage organizations and manage life;
quantification is not only present, but also directly influences the world
we inhabit. It is important to recognize that, in contemporary societies,
the extension of quantification to new previously non-commensurable
domains is driven by a multiplicity of actors, institutions and processes,
which, in turn, it helps to configure. Quantification operates as a
device that acts on individuals and intervenes in their lives to
guarantee a certain type of conduct or behavior. It is important to
study the constitutive role of quantification practices, because they
create a particular way of understanding, representing and acting on
processes, events and subjectivities. Likewise, it is essential to
recover its potential for social transformation, as these tools also
allow us to mobilize criticism, denounce inequalities, define and give
visibility to new problems, so that it is possible to intervene on them.
Statistics are not and have not always been exclusive weapons of the
powerful, their potential to challenge consensus and repoliticize social
relations remains inexhaustible.
Thinking sociologically about complex realities such as those in
Latin America through a quantification approach is an urgent
challenge, which leads us to cut out new objects of study and
construct other axes of problematization. The deep social inequalities
in the region – exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic – must be
understood in their reproduction dynamics, which includes models of
statistical objectification and their implications for the development of
public policies. We believe it necessary to reveal the social nature of their patterned forms of

In this sense, our analysis showed that there is still much to be
studied about the social and political impacts of quantification in
democratic societies. To this end, sociology has very valuable tools at
its disposal, which make it possible to highlight the effects produced by the devices of

This work sought to highlight the contributions of social studies of
quantification to sociology as a whole. The literature review made it
possible to highlight the richness of this analytical perspective,
recognizing that, in addition to disagreements about whether or not it is
a specialized field, in the strict sense of the term, there is still a lack of
a research program that goes beyond the common questions and
affiliations of researchers located there.

Another type of question arises when we observe the increasingly
intense circulation of numbers (not only disparate, but often contradictory)
in national public cultures, in terms of the role they play in democratic
discussions, in a scenario of increasing political polarization in several
countries. Of region. This approach also has the possibility of warning,
on solid conceptual and empirical bases, about the “neo-colonization”
of Latin American states, present in the tendency of recent governments
(from the right to the left of the political spectrum) to be subordinated to
the various modalities of the neoliberal metric, increasingly rooted in
public administration, after the adoption of the managerial management
model.

measurement to build alternative quantifications, which allow us to
envision other ways of resolving the region's impasses and problems.
Social studies of quantification have expanded our understanding
of the links between the State and ethnic, racial and sexual minorities

in pluri-ethnic and diverse societies such as Latin America, both in the
present and in the past. They highlighted the processes of configuring
their identities, the recognition or invisibility of these groups, through
the alteration or creation of classification categories, within the
framework of political struggles for recognition of the State, as shown in
Mara Loveman's article in this dossier . A path that deserves to be further explored.

quantification between different social groups, discerning the variety of
uses and applications to which they may be subject, as well as revealing
the ways in which power relations operate, their limits and ambiguities. It
remains for us to appeal to the community of social scientists, calling on
them to nurture, strengthen and expand a research program whose

fruitfulness we hope to have demonstrated in this article.
