ABSTRACT
From its origins in antiquity to the emergence of neoliberalism,
democracy had always been thought of as a fragile institutional
construct, comprising two complementary dimensions: an
objective dimension (its formal institutions), and a subjective one
(instituting its citizens). Appeared in the 1970s, the Law and
economic doctrine has undermined this bases of democracy by
assimilating the enactment of laws to negotiation on a market,
and reducing democracy to a ‘market of ideas’. The specific status
of speech in the democratic area fades out, paving the way for
‘post-truth politics’ and ‘democratic dictatorships’.

Democracy is one of the solutions invented by human beings to the problem of having to
impose on members of a given society the rules by which they must live. It is a vital issue
for the human species, and for the human species alone.
In order to understand this, we must return briefly to physical anthropology, and LeroiGourhan’s
admirable depiction of the process whereby the great apes were cast into a
world of signs and objects which could embody their mental images.1 Human beings,
like all other animals, inhabit the world first through their senses, but unlike all other
animals, they have access to a symbolic universe which transcends the here and now of
instinctual life, by means of language and technology. The finitude of organic, instinctual
life is complemented by a limitless world of mental representation. However, as the poet
Jacques Prévert says, ‘le monde mental ment, monumentalement’.
2

With his two dimensions – his feet on the ground and his head in the stars – man is
always liable to lose his footing in reality, and to be swept off his feet by his giddying
mental representations. Entering the intoxicating world of symbols comes at a price
which other animals never experience: the risk of delusion, and above all the illusion of
omnipotence. This is why human beings must be ‘instituted’, that is, subjected to a representation
of the world which is shared by all. A society that does not institute its children
will see them turn into murderers. Instituting reason means enabling the human being to
harmonise the finitude of his physical existence with the infinity of his mental universe. In
other words, since our mental images both link us to, and separate us from, the physical

world, instituting reason enables us to distinguish between what in our images belongs to
reality, what to possibility, and what to pure fantasy.
This education of reason, which each of us had to go through as a child, and which in
reality is never completed, is essential for drawing us out of the solipsism of our subjective
lives so that we can have the same representation of the world as others, and so communicate
with them. But communication is conditional upon accepting the law of language,
that is, having as common reference symbols that are outside of us and that are binding on
us all. Only then will we be able to participate in the type of ‘speech assembly’ which we
know of as ‘democracy’. To address the question of democracy again at this elementary
level of ‘speech assemblies’ can shed light on the factors determining its emergence and
survival.

I – Democracy as a type of speech assembly

A brief foray into linguistics is required here in order to understand how linguistic
exchange differs from the signals exchanged by animals. If we take the typology drawn
up by Charles Peirce (1839–1914), we find three types of representation of the world, to
which correspond three types of reference.3
The first is iconic, the icon being the physical image of the represented object, whether
this object exists in reality or not; images are icons, as are diagrams, algebraic equations,
and metaphors.4
The second is indexical: the index is the physical or temporal mark of the presence
of the object; it does not resemble the object, but signals its presence. ‘Everything whichattracts
our attention is an index’, Peirce writes, ‘insofar as it marks the juncture between two
states of experience.’
5 Examples include a knock at the door, a clap of thunder, the visitor’s
soaked clothes, the swaying gait of the sailor, the calloused hands of the labourer, the president’s
flashy watch, or the movements of a wind vane.
The third type of reference is symbolic: symbols refer to the object via a mediating
system of signs, independently of any resemblance, or physical or temporal link to the
object. Peirce refers to symbols as ‘legisigns’: ‘a symbol is a law’,
6 he says, ‘a sign which
acts as a law for all its singular uses. Every ordinary word is thus a symbol, applicable
to everything which can realise the idea attached to this word.’
7 Unlike the index, the
symbol is not physically linked to an object. It relates to objects via the system of signs
of which it is a part.
Towards the end of his life, Peirce declared that ‘man is a sign’, in other words, he
is a symbolic animal, which precisely differentiates him from animals. Animals
exchange many different signals, which respond to different circumstances.
But these are indexical, that is, a certain cry or whistle corresponds to a certain
object.8

A rat or a monkey can therefore learn to make a correlation between the sound ‘food’
and the food itself. A direct link is made between a sign and an object, each sign being the
index of the presence of an object or a particular situation – a certain danger, for example.
It is a stimulus which functions separately from all the others, as long as it is proved by the
here and now of sense experience (the stimulus disappears if recurrently the rat sees no
food appear when it hears the word ‘food’, just as we stop paying attention to a fire
alarm that goes of unexpectedly several times a week).
By contrast, the meaning of a word in a language persists independently of its actualisation.
I would even go so far as to say that it persists even more forcefully when this actualisation
is impossible: conjuring up a swim in the sea or a walk in the hills has much more
power for the prisoner locked in his cell, or the hospitalised patient on a drip. This quality
of language was highlighted by Leroi-Gourhan, its ability to transport us far from the here
and now of our physical existence. It can do this because the words of a language, unlike
the cries of animals, are not indices separated from each other, but quite the reverse: they
refer to each other as parts of the same linguistic structure. Their sense depends on how
they are associated with one another, as we can test by opening a dictionary and taking the
word ‘fast’, for example, which has various meanings, relating to going without food, fixity,
and speed.9 It is this symbolic structure which allows us to depict both real and imaginary
things.
‘Reference’, in linguistics, is thus different from a simple indexing of things, from a collection
of signals, each of which points to something. It is above all a reference to a symbolic
structure, and this reference is necessarily shared by the language’s speakers. As the
great linguist Émile Benveniste wrote:

In an utterance, language [la langue] is used to express certain relations to the world. The precondition
for this mobilisation and appropriation of a language is, for the speaker, the need to
refer by means of discourse, and, for the interlocutor, the possibility of co-referring identically,
in conformity with the pragmatic consensus which makes of each speaker a co-speaker. Reference
is an integral part of utterance.10

An index refers to a natural object; language refers to a system of signs.
Reference, in the linguistic sense used here by Benveniste, does not mean the direct
reference of a word to a thing, but a shared reference to a symbolic system capable of
expressing all sorts of experience, both real and imaginary.
Reference, capital ‘R’, the precondition for linguistic exchange, is not something we can
just get a feel for: that which guarantees sense eludes the senses. Linguistic communication
is therefore never binary, but always ternary, because it supposes speakers who already
refer to the same symbolic system. This structure involves human beings in what can
be called, literally, a logic of inter-diction.11 Reference, a necessary passage via the third,
both inter-poses itself between, and links together speakers. In the strict sense, it is the
source of inter-diction.

That is why human societies cannot be assimilated to animal herds, nor political
communities to a form of ‘living together’. Human beings do not have access to rationality
without society, and they cannot form a society without accepting a common
Reference, that is, without complying with the logic of inter-diction thanks to which
they can exchange words rather than blows. By taking up the question of democracy
at this elementary level we can gain insight into how it resembles, and how it differs
from other forms of political organisation. It resembles other forms in the need for
a common Reference, and the logic of inter-diction. It differs from these in how the
inter-dictions are laid down.
In the long history of us poor humans, these interdictions have for the most part been
imposed on the many by the few, whose power is rooted in religion, tradition or, more
rarely, in force alone. The corresponding regimes have been exhaustively classified by political
scientists from Aristotle to Montesquieu – aristocratic, monarchic, and despotic
regimes, among others. In all of these, the rules imposed are heteronomous, that is,
their source is located in the gods, or in men accorded higher status.
Democracy emerged from a rather marginal practice, in Ancient Greece, but not only
there, whereby free men in a given society came together as equals to decide on common
affairs. Each member of the assembly had the right to contribute to the enactment of the
norm, and could, on occasion, contradict the opinion of his peers. This has given us the
agonistic dimension of democracy,12 which, from a jurist’s perspective, is expressed
nowhere better than in labour law.
Comparative research coordinated by Marcel Détienne13 has shown that the democratic
practice of speech assemblies has been present at times and in places as varied
as the Ochollo in Ethiopia,14 monastic communities in Japan15 and in Medieval
Europe,16 assemblies of the clergy in fifteenth-century France, of Cossack warriors
in sixteenth- to seventeenth-century Ukraine, and of the inhabitants of Pacific atolls,
as described by the first anthropologists to land there in the nineteenth century.17
What these widely varying cases have in common is their institution of a place for
politics where people gather in accordance with certain rule-bound procedures to
debate as equals on questions of common interest, and to take decisions which will
be binding on all.
The spatial dimension of democratic debate has been superbly described by Jean-Pierre
Vernant from this perspective.18 Once the people are assembled, each person has an equal
right to speak (isègoria). A sceptre, symbolising power, is ‘placed in the centre’ (en méso,
which also means mediate and measure) of the circle formed by his fellow men (homoïoï).
The person who wishes to speak advances to the centre and takes up the sceptre, to signify
the public status of the words he is about to speak. When he has finished, he puts the

sceptre down, and returns to his place. Thereupon, his speech ceases to be public and
becomes private again. Like every speech assembly, democracy must presuppose that its
members share the same normative reference. In the case of democracy, this reference
is not only linguistic, it is also moral and economic.

II – The institution of democracy

From its origins in antiquity to the emergence of neoliberalism, democracy had always
been thought of as a fragile institutional construct, comprising two complementary
dimensions: an objective dimension (its formal institutions), and a subjective one (instituting
its citizens).
Democratic regimes, in their objective dimension, both separate and carefully articulate
three institutions, each of which has its particular place and rules:

(a) a political assembly, where debate on the public interest takes place;
(b) a market, where private interests are negotiated;
(c) a space for the sacred (religio in its original legal sense), or sphere of dogmatic Reference,
which is both the source of meaning and the guarantee of the trustworthiness of
the pledged word, whether in a commercial or political context.

This necessary religious dimension in the institution of the State (which is clearly visible
in the layout of Greek Cities and Medieval free towns) should make us sceptical of the idea
that democracy is synonymous with a secularisation of the political sphere, or rather, concomitantly,
that collective autonomy can be achieved without any heteronomous
instance.19 Political freedom, like freedom of speech, requires a heteronomous Reference
respected by all. Democracy’s watchword is indeed isonomy, the equal right to take part in
enacting legislation. However, in the public sphere, this isonomy is subordinated to what
The Digest calls – speaking of public law – ‘sacred affairs’.
20

Tocqueville dwelt on this link between a shared faith and civil liberties when observing
the early days of American democracy. ‘If man’, he writes, ‘does not have faith, he must
serve, and if he is free, he must believe.’
21 And indeed, the American Declaration of Independence
opens with the assertion that there exist ‘self-evident truths’, that is, an axiological
basis and orientation to the political community, which all its members must respect.
From this perspective, democracy requires the institution of a demos, a people of citizens,
in order to survive. Members of the demos must fulfil three requirements, each of
which corresponds to one of the constitutive facets of democracy:

(a) a training and an education which makes them capable of distinguishing between the
public interest and their private interests;
(b) an economic independence through work, so that citizens are not divided by too great
inequalities of wealth, nor enslaved to each other;

19Radical collective autonomy is an idea put forward by Cornelius Castoriadis, for example in Le monde morcelé. Carrefours
du labyrinthe 3 (Seuil, 1990) 137–71. 20Sunt enim quædam publice utilia, quædam privatim. Publicum jus in sacris, in sacerdotibus, in magistratibus consistit,
(Digeste, 1, 1. §.2). 21Tocqueville, De la démocratie en Amérique, II (Gallimard, 1966) 29.

JURISPRUDENCE 453
(c) an ethic of truth, that is, the courage to say what one thinks and be challenged by what
others think, in speech assemblies which aim to come to an agreement on what is and
what should be.

Although these three conditions are structurally linked, we shall briefly summarise each
one separately. They are the backbone of what a long tradition has called civic virtues,
which can also be called the subjective dimension of democracy.
(a) Starting with education, which the Greeks called paideia (παιδεία), this is education
not in the sense of accumulating knowledge, but in the sense of a formative process for the
individual. The practice of democratic debate constitutes a training in rational argumentation
during which reasonings based on received authority must give way to the authority
of rational argument. Democratic debate both fosters, and relies on, the participants’
ability to distinguish private from public utility, and to make sure that the latter prevails
over the former. The ideal of this education is to serve the public interest, not to amass
personal wealth. (The Greeks would have been appalled by the idea of having billionaires
as a model for their youth).
Montesquieu highlights this same point many centuries later, in his well-known typology
of governments. He distinguishes three forms – monarchy, despotism and republicanism
– each of which is based on a principle, respectively honour, fear and virtue. A mode of
government can only perpetuate itself if its associated guiding principle is instilled into the
population from their earliest years. This requirement is particularly vital for Republican
government.

It is in a republican government that the whole power of education is required. The fear of despotic
governments naturally arises of itself amidst threats and punishments; the honour of
monarchies is favoured by the passions, and favours them in its turn; but virtue is a self-renunciation,
which is ever arduous and painful.

This virtue may be defined as the love of the laws and of our country. As such love requires a
constant preference of public to private interest, it is the source of all private virtues; for they are
nothing more than this very preference itself. (…)

Everything therefore depends on establishing this love in a republic; and to inspire it ought to be
the principal business of education22

(b) Second, a democracy requires its citizens to achieve economic autonomy through
work. Following Solon’s reforms in 594–593 B.C.E., the idea that work is necessary for
the citizenship of the less wealthy began to take shape. It has been reaffirmed throughout
the history of democratic institutions until the twentieth century.
The need to shelter democracy from the domination of the richest members of society
was a constant concern in the conception of French and American democracy. The founding
fathers did not have in mind capitalism, but a population of small-scale independent
workers, and the French revolutionaries, faithful to Rousseau, did not aspire to the invisible
hand of the market, nor to an appetite for riches, but to the sovereignty of the general
will, and the cult of virtue:

22Montesquieu, L’esprit des lois, L. IV, Ch. V, in Œuvres complètes (Gallimard-La Pléiade, 1951) vol. 2, 266–67, translated by
Thomas Nugens (1752).

454 A. SUPIOT
It is most important not to allow any professional financiers in the Republic, not so much
because of their dishonest profits as because of the fatal example they set; an example which,
all too promptly diffused throughout the nation, destroys all worthy feelings by making illicit
wealth and its advantages respectable, and by covering unselfishness, simplicity, morality
and all the virtues with a cloud of scorn and opprobrium.23
Rousseau was not the only French philosopher to hold this opinion. Montesquieu is
always quoted for his defense of the civilising virtues of ‘gentle commerce’. The economist
Albert Hirschman quotes him at length in his excellent book on the political justifications
of capitalism before its prime.24 Curiously, however, Hirschman does not mention Montesquieu’s
distinction between the beneficial effects of trade on relations between nations
and the harm it causes in relations between individuals.

If the spirit of commerce unites nations, it does not in the same manner unite individuals. We
see that in countries where the people move only by the spirit of commerce, they make a traffic
of all the humane, all the moral virtues; the most trifling things, those which humanity would
demand, are there done, or there given, only for money.25

In order to avoid such excesses, laws should ‘divide up wealth as trade grows’, so that the
poor can – and the rich must – live from their labour.

In order to support the spirit of commerce (…) these very laws, by dividing the estates of individuals
in proportion to the increase of commerce, should set every poor citizen so far at his ease
as to be able to work like the rest, and every wealthy citizen in such a mediocrity as to be obliged
to take some pains either in preserving or acquiring a fortune.
26

From Jefferson to Eisenhower via Brandeis and F.D. Roosevelt, work was always conceived
as the best training for self-government. But democracy was in mortal danger if ever economic
power held sway over political power. Roosevelt mentions this in his last speech, in
favour of the adoption of a Second Bill of Rights, in January 1944:

We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist
without economic security and independence. “Necessitous men are not free men.” People
who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.27

(c) The third condition for a democratic society is that its members observe an ethic of
truth. This is the ethic which Foucault, discussing Greek classical theatre,28 calls ‘parrêsia’,
or truth-telling:

The place of parrêsia is defined and guaranteed by the politeia; but parrêsia, the truth-telling of
the political man, is what assures the appropriate game of politics. The importance of parrêsia,
it seems to me, is found in this meeting point. At any rate, it seems to me that we find here the

root of a problematic of a society’s immanent power relations which, unlike the juridical-institutional
system of that society, ensure that it is actually governed. The problems of governmentality
in their specificity, in their complex relation to but also independence from politeia,
appear and are formulated for the first time round this notion of parrêsia and the exercise
of power through true discourse.29

This good parrêsia is opposed to a bad parrêsia, which resembles it in order to deceive the
citizens more effectively. Bad parrêsia is the demagogue’s ‘saying it straight’, but above all
the abuse of speech, that is, the ‘false speech’ of the sophists, who are not interested in the
truth, but only in seducing the masses with rousing speeches. It is a rhetoric which can be
summed up in the expression selected as ‘Word of the Year 2016’ by Oxford Dictionaries,
‘“post-truth” politics’.
Foucault was not the first thinker to foreground the importance of the subjective internalisation
of the conditions of democracy, that is, the dependence of democratic institutions
on people with the courage to make them thrive. He was rediscovering the crucial role of
what a whole lineage of jurists, from Cicero to Vico and Montesquieu, called ‘civic virtues’.
This is the list Cicero gives30:

Religio est, quæ superioris cujusdam naturæ, quam divinam
vocant, curam caerimoniamque affert;
Religion is that which causes men to pay attention to, and to
respect with fixed ceremonies, a certain superior nature
which men call divine nature.
pietas, per quam sanguine conjunctis patriæque benivolis
officium et diligens tribuitur cultus;
Affection (Piety) is that feeling under the influence of which
kindness and careful attention is paid to those who are
united to us by ties of blood, or who are devoted to the
service of their country.
gratia, in qua amicitiarum et officiorum alterius memoria et
remunerandi voluntas continetur;
Gratitude is that feeling in which the recollection of friendship,
and of the services which we have received from another,
and the inclination to requite those services, is contained.
vindicatio, per quam vis aut iniuria et omnino omne, quod
obfuturum est, defendendo aut ulciscendo propulsatur;
Avenging is that disposition by which violence and injury, and
altogether everything which can be any injury to us, is
repelled by defending oneself from it, or by avenging it..
observantia, per quam homines aliqua dignitate
antecedentes cultu quodam et honore dignantur;
Respect is that feeling by which men obey when they think
those who are eminent for worth or dignity, worthy of some
special respect and honour.
veritas, per quam immutata ea, quæ sunt, aut ante fuerunt,
aut futura sunt, dicuntur.
Truth is that by which those things which are, or which have
been previously, or which are about to happen, are spoken
of without any alteration.

Foucault’s good parrêsia is in fact the Latin veritas, a virtue which is vital for the functioning
of speech assemblies based on an equal right to speak (isègoria), that is, for democratic
institutions in their most essential aspect. Using the term ‘virtue’ has the advantage
of highlighting the fact that, for a democracy to function adequately, its citizens must be
individually and collectively committed to telling the truth. In other words, they must be
educated, they must be inculcated with a respect for the truth, and they must have
sufficient economic power to participate in expressing it.
So, contrary to what Foucault maintains, parrêsia is not ‘independent of the politeia’,
understood as democracy’s legal and institutional framework. Foucault himself – always
somewhat uneasy with the question of the law – contradicts this idea of independence

29Foucault, Le Gouvernement de soi et des autres (n 28) 147. Underlying is mine (A.S.). 30Cicero, De inuentione, II, LIII, in Œuvres complètes de Cicéron, English translation by C. D. Yonge (the translation of vindicatio,
which is misleadingly translated as ‘vengeance’ (Fr) and ‘revenge’ (Eng) in these editions, has been modified by the
author.

456 A. SUPIOT
when he notes at the outset, quite rightly, that ‘the place of parrêsia is defined and guaranteed
by the politeia’. Although it does indeed take courage to speak out in a democratic
assembly, it is not the same courage for the Prince’s counsellor, the Resistance fighter in
Nazi-occupied France, and the Soviet dissident or prisoner in the Gulag, as immortalised
by Varlan Shalamov in his Kolyma Tales.31 In the latter case, the risk is death, and the
virtue required is not only veritas, but also vindicatio: the courage not only to speak the
truth, but also to act in defence of others, and denounce injustice.
In one of these ‘tales’, Shalamov recounts how he was forced to stand in line in the
camp’s training ground for an unbearably long roll call in the depth of a Siberian
winter. A prisoner near him collapsed from exhaustion. His face was covered in blood.
The soldiers were kicking him to make him stand up:

Suddenly, I felt a wave of warmth come over me. I understood that everything, all my life, was
at stake at this moment. If I did not do something - I didn’t really know what - there would
have been no point my coming with this convoy, no point to my twenty years of life. My
shame at my own cowardice, which had been burning my cheeks, suddenly vanished: I felt
them go cold again, and my body felt strangely light.

I stepped out of line, and said in a halting voice:

- I forbid you to strike this man.

Shalamov’s artistry, and his experience of the Gulag, succeed in conveying to us what is
meant by the institution of the subject, by the subject’s incorporation of a virtue which,
by dint of being practised, takes on an existential value. He also helps us understand
the process of dispossession at work in the universe of the camps, where the human
being is methodically stripped of the attribute of legal subject, and driven to abandon
any sort of virtue.
We do not need to be reminded of such extreme situations to realise that the courage
required to speak out is different under non-democratic regimes, which willingly grant
legal status to their populations, but keep them in such subordination that their
freedom of expression is curtailed or abolished. This is particularly evident in business
enterprises. The neglect of this institutional context of truth-telling has generated the
confusions we see today between collective bargaining and democracy in the
company. It must be stressed that a relation of dependence or subordination rules out
the possibility of isègoria, or equal right to speech. If we focus on the individual as
the sole agent of speaking the truth, we shall erroneously think that business enterprises
are a democratic politeia. In so doing, we risk making collective bargaining into an
instrument of collective submission.

III – The dislocation of democracy

Insofar as democratic regimes are dependent on the virtue of their members, they are particularly
fragile. They run specific risks, described by Giambattista Vico in the closing
pages of his New Science. Vico admires the grandeur of what he calls ‘popular commonwealths’
in which ‘entire peoples, who have in common the desire for justice, command

laws that are just because they are good for all’.
32 The democratic practice of debating proposed
legislation educates the rational faculty, and this leads people to ground the social
order in philosophical rather than religious principles.33 But although such commonwealths
or republics may be admirable, they are also precarious, because their capacity
to survive depends upon the virtue of their citizens.
And indeed, just when such commonwealths achieve their greatest political and
material successes, they become vulnerable to the ‘barbarism of reflection’. This involves,
Vico continues, a misuse of abstraction. Abstraction no longer serves to hold our passions
in check and work towards a common, objective view of the world, but to ‘calumniate the
truth’ and support any cause at all, as long as it serves private interests. ‘Learned fools’ cast
off all common reason, and set about dismissing the very idea of the general interest, or
else they subordinate it to the pursuit of private utilities.34 Such diseased commonwealths,
in Vico’s view, witness their citizens lose interest in the common good, and so ‘the strength
which had led the people to leave their primary solitude disappears’.
35 Thereafter, the
society falls apart, and each individual sinks into civic apathy and social isolation. Vico
gives a striking description of this state:

Such peoples, like so many beasts, have fallen into the custom of each man thinking only of his
own private interests, and having reached the extreme of delicacy, or better of pride, like wild
animals they bristle and lash out at the slightest displeasure. Thus in the midst of their greatest
wealth and festivities, though physically thronging together, they live like wild beasts in a deep
solitude of spirit and will, scarcely any two being able to agree since each follows his own pleasure
or caprice.
36

In this state of decomposition, political power becomes the instrument of wealth, which
paves the way for demagogy and civil war. Thus, Vico states, ‘do commonwealths fall
from a perfect liberty into perfect tyranny’.
37 Only this experience of the return to the barbarousness
of the senses can drive them to rediscover a sense of civic virtue, namely ‘the
piety, faith and truth which are the natural foundations of justice.’
This diagnosis is remarkably relevant today. Appeared in the 1970s, the economic
analysis of law has effectively destroyed the three bases of democracy we outlined
above. In 1975, Richard Posner, the founder of the ‘Law and Economics’ doctrine,
assimilated the enactment of laws to negotiation on a market, and reduced democracy
to a ‘market of ideas’.
38 He was simply extrapolating a thesis formulated by Ronald
Coase in the previous year, in a seminal article entitled ‘The Economics of the First
Amendment. The Market for Goods and the Market for Ideas’.
39 Coase argues that
there is no fundamental difference between these two types of ‘markets’, and so
public policy decisions on ‘Goods’ and on ‘Ideas’ should both conform to economic

rules.40 The United States Supreme Court subsequently confirmed this vision of
democracy as a market of ideas in two well-known rulings: Buckley41 and Belotti.
42

These had limited effect until the notorious Citizens United43 ruling of 2010, which
demonstrated the full logical implications of this conflation.
The case concerned an organisation, called Citizens Union, that despite being nonprofit
was massively financed by private funds (its annual budget was roughly 12
million dollars). To coincide with the Democratic primaries of 2008, it wanted to broadcast
a free-access documentary called Hillary, which was in fact an attack on the candidate
Hillary Clinton. In the terms of the McCain–Feingold law, business enterprises had the
right to support certain political opinions, but they could not intervene, in the period preceding
elections, for or against a particular candidate. If they did want to do so, their action
had to take the form of ad hoc committees, using limited funds, and closely monitored by
the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Within this set-up, Citizens Union challenged
only the limits placed on the budget. But the 5 conservative judges of the Supreme
Court – Justices Roberts, Alito, Scalia, Thomas and Kennedy – seized on this case to
forbid any intervention at all on the ‘market of ideas’ other than the minimum required
for transparency. In so doing, the Court’s judgement endorsed the two principles which
underpin this vision of democracy as a ‘market in ideas’.
44

The first principle is the equivalence between a quantity of money and a quantity of
ideas. Consequently, any reduction in the quantity of money spent on political propaganda
is equally a reduction in the quantity of political expression, and is presumed to
limit the number of subjects discussed, the thoroughness of the discussion, and the size
of the audience reached.
The second principle is that of the equal treatment of legal persons and physical persons
regarding freedom of expression. Ignoring the functionalist vision of legal personality
defended previously, the Citizens United ruling sees legal persons as ‘speakers’ like any
other:

Quite apart from the purpose or effect of regulating content (…), the Government may commit
a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies certain preferred speakers. By taking the right
to speak from some and giving it to others, the Government deprives the disadvantaged person
or class of the right to use speech to strive to establish worth, standing, and respect for the speaker’s
voice. The Government may not by these means deprive the public of the right and privilege
to determine for itself what speech and speakers are worthy of consideration. The First Amendment
protects speech and speaker, and the ideas that flow from each.

As such, any restriction on their contribution to the public debate constitutes a form of
censorship incompatible with the First Amendment of the Constitution. This judgment
overturned the precedent set by Austin,
45 which had confirmed the restriction:

Austin interferes with the ‘open marketplace’ of ideas protected by the First Amendment. It
permits the Government to ban the political speech of millions of associations of citizens.

JURISPRUDENCE 459
The censorship we now confront is vast in its reach. The Government has ‘muffle[d] the voices
that best represent the most significant segments of the economy.’ (…)

When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a
person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses
censorship to control thought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to
think for ourselves.46

Without batting an eyelid, the Supreme Court thus decided that the voice of big business is
the voice which best represents the nation’s economic interests. And it invoked the principle
of equality to give big business the same rights of expression as ordinary citizens.
Although consequently there should be no distinction made between the voice of a
simple citizen and that of a business enterprise, one still has to admit that the voice of
business is better, it is the maior et sanior pars of the electorate, to use (and travesty)
the vocabulary of the canonists.47 Or, to put it another way, in the words of Orwell’s
Animal Farm: ‘All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.’
48

Historically, democracy was assimilated to a marketplace for the first time in 1919, with
jurists such as Justice Holmes,49 and the idea flourished, paradoxically, thanks to the New
Deal. The New Deal was inspired by a belief in unlimited growth, a sort of economic motor
of history, which the Social State could use to reconcile the concentration of capital and
social justice. Economic dogma thus acquired the commanding position, which it still
occupies for the legal realm. It conferred a ‘scientific legitimacy’ on the assimilation of
ideas and beliefs to products in competition on a market, and it also ‘legitimated’ the
definition of democracy as a regime which should protect the invention and circulation
of such ‘intellectual products’ from any form of legal constraint. The sphere of the
market thus absorbed the political realm (the electoral market), as well as the space of
the sacred (the market of religions),50 and the figure of the citizen gave way to that of
the consumer. In this context, the ethics of citizenship – education, financial independence
in and through work, and respect for the truth – lost any meaning.
The specific status which political speech had gained in all the experiences of democracy,
that is, as a speech designed to express a certain representation of the public good,
and not to defend private interests, could no longer be justified. Moreover, in the marketplace
of ideas, since all discourses are in principle worth the same, reducing the amount of
money invested in one discourse is deemed to directly reduce its freedom to express itself.
This situation embodies the replacement of democracy by what Colin Crouch has called
‘post-democracy’,
51 a regime in which the freedom and equality of citizens are subordinated
to the free play of economic rules, rather than ensuring that economic activities
are subordinated to the requirements of the political sphere.
Today, the best example of this ‘post-democratic’ regime can be found in the Chinese
Constitution. Its first Article defines the People’s Republic of China as ‘a State of democratic
dictatorship’.
