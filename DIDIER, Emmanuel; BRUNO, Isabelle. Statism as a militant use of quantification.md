“Statativism” as a militant use of

quantification

Resume

Le «statactivisme» comme usage militant de la quantificationÿ

Summary

Mots clefs: statactivisme, sociologie de la quantification, émancipation, institutions, realité.

Quatre types de statactivisme sont presentés : monitor les contradictions internales
des institutions, prendre des libertés avec les règles, identify des groupes sociaux
en struggle, et proposer des indicateurs alternatifs.

This article presents stativism. It is both a concept that describes a set of statistical
practices aimed at emancipation, and a slogan that calls on social actors to use the
power of quantification in their struggles, instead of rejecting it and surrendering it. it
to powerful institutions. Four forms of stativism are presented: showing the internal
contradictions of institutions, making rules more flexible, identifying social groups in
struggle and proposing alternative indicators.ÿ

Cet article présente le statactivisme. Il s'agit à la fois d'un concept décrivant un
ensemble de practices statistics qui visent à l'émancipation et d'un mot d'ordre
enjoignant les acteurs sociaux à s'emparer de la force de la quantification dans leurs
luttes sociales plutôt que de la refuser en la laissant aux institutions puissantes.

Keywords: stativism, sociology of quantification, emancipation, institutions, reality.

(Desrosières, 2008). Its hard core consists of a permanent quantitative
and comparative assessment of the activity of agents, thus placed in
competition through a technology that can be called benchmarking

to be confused with the action itself. Now, “since the quantification procedures

of numbers. Quantification often plays a prominent role in the
production of the “authority of facts”, which has been at the heart of the
difficulties encountered by the Frankfurt School in its effort to construct
a theory of emancipation (Genel, 2013; Bruno, 2015).

Despite the inaccuracies that the term raises, one can agree to call

the current state of reality neoliberal. This, to a large extent, is shaped
and consolidated by statistics, which in itself should not be surprising.

As can be seen from the etymology of the word, statistics has been
linked, since its origins, to power, in particular to the power of the State
(Bourdieu, 2012), however, neither of the two has remained immutable.

We believe that, for critical thinking, one of the ways of confronting
the authority of facts is found, then, in the distinction, proposed by Luc
Boltanski in De la Critique, between, on the one hand, “reality” which

“tends to confuse oneself with what seems to be sustained in some way
only by its strength, that is, by order”, and on the other, “the world” as
“everything that happens”, the set of “events or experiences whose
possibility is not inserted in the design of reality” (Boltanski, 2009, p.

93-94). The first is organized based on “formats, determined under the
coercion of an institutional power”, which tend to “address the world in

its entirety” (Boltanski, 2009, p. 140). The second, “immersed in the flow
of life”, consists of experiences that are difficult to “express in
words” (Boltanski, 2009, p. 94). This opposition seems to us to be very
useful for understanding the effects of domination and also the critical force attributed to statistics.

they are codified and routinized, their products are reified. They tend to

2008, p. 12). We are then obliged to achieve quantified goals and

indefinitely intensify our performance according to the values defined

by the indicator. The practice refers to a baseline of optimal reproduction

of the same, despite variations, experiments, accidents and unforeseen

events. The insertion of actors into increasingly closed quantification

networks therefore seems to be one of the main instruments for

narrowing the practical possibilities offered to them.

With the development of benchmarking, statistics became the

target of much criticism and, ultimately, rejection on principle. The first

of performance management techniques , which consist of quantifying

These professionals denounced such techniques due to the

impenetrability of quantifying what sociologist Florent Champy calls

“prudential practices”, that is , attention to particular cases, complex and specific situations.

arguments from different currents of Lacanian psychoanalysis (ECF,

2008; Milner, 2011) or the paradigm of the gift (Caillé, 2012). This

happened in such a way that statistics that have a very distant

relationship with benchmarking and that, until then, enjoyed a very

progressive image, became targets of criticism.

2 On May 15, 2012, a conference on “stativism” was organized in Paris, which gave
rise to the work Statactivisme : comment lutter avec des nombres (Bruno; Didier;
Prévieux, 2014).

“Statativism” as a militant use of quantification 85

It was then possible to show the importance of stativism in the fight against

the abuse of power by the police in France (Didier, 2018) or, even,

Afterwards, a special edition in English of the Italian magazine

Partecipazione e conflict made it more widely accessible (Bruno; Didier; Vitale, 2014).

This neologism must, therefore, be understood both as a slogan to

be brandished in struggles and as a descriptive concept, used to qualify

experiments aimed at reappropriating the emancipatory power of statistics.

Since 2012,2 successive works carried out by groups of researchers, as

well as activists and artists, have made it possible, on the one hand, to

map a set of practices related to this aspiration and, on the other, to

explain the tensions and issues in which this use of quantification plunged

us. These efforts resulted in many publications that nurtured and

exemplified the concept of stativism. First, a book enabled its wide

dissemination in France (Bruno; Didier; Prévieux, 2014).

However, if today statistics are readily criticized for their collusion

with power and sanction, the history of their links with social reform and

emancipation is equally long and rich. Statistics also showed, in the past,

that another reality was possible or made other possibilities real. That's

why we don't react like those who totally reject them and shout “No to how

much phrenia! No to numbers! Yes to the qualities!”, because, in doing so,

they leave the monopoly of these instruments to the powerful. Well, there

is no reason why quantification should always be on the side of the State

and capital. It is important to move away from this state-centric view, which

is particularly dominant in France (Didier, 2021), and to highlight other

modes of production and other uses of numbers. To explore the field of

these militant practices, using statistics as a resource of resistance, we

coined a term to name the thing: “stativism”.

they aim to emancipate themselves from the government methods typical of that model.

Stativism has a broader and a restricted meaning. Firstly , it designates all

statistical practices that serve to criticize and emancipate oneself from an authority,

whatever it may be. These statistical practices have been around for a long time – we

will return to them. In a second, more restricted sense, some of these practices are

more specifically adapted to the type of power exercised within the scope of neoliberal

governmentality;

In other words, let us remember Desrosières' (2003) argument, according to which we

can list five different forms of State, all of which use statistical tools to act, but each

according to a specific modality. For example, the Keynesian State resorts to national

accounting, as it allows it to control the flows useful for the consumption stimulus policy,

while the neoliberal State prefers to mobilize performance indicators and quantified

targets to evaluate the efficiency of its services. There is a correspondence between

the form of action

Finally, the concept has been used on numerous occasions to analyze the

COVID-19 pandemic, which is also, without a doubt, a pandemic of numbers. For

example, the indicators used by public authorities, such as the number of infections or

deaths, could be questioned, as they would focus attention on medical problems,

diverting it from the socioeconomic consequences of implemented policies, which, in

turn, would be little statistically represented (Didier, 2020). On the other hand, the

ethical tensions associated with quantitative epidemiological models were highlighted

in an article published in Nature that invites, under the banner of statism, statisticians

and modelers to act in a more “transparent and unpretentious” way , to disclose

information such as the limitations of their data, and also to admit that scientific work is

not apart from the social world, its contingencies and uncertainties, its conflicts and

power relations (Saltelli et al. 2020).

If stativism consists of putting statistics at the service of

emancipation, we can distinguish four different ways of proceeding.

The first indicates paths for the study of stativism in a broad sense; it

allows, through a historical review, to question the degree of radicality

of statistical criticism. Next, we will analyze more contemporary practices

of stativism; they may be more or less specific to neoliberal government,

as past forms of authority survive the emergence of new ones, and so

do critical forms . The second part shows how to circumvent – individually

and often secretly – the rules of accountability in order to appropriate

the results of the exercise. The third mobilizes statistics to consolidate

collective categories that provide bases for claiming rights and defending

To face this governmentality that infiltrates a large number of

normally compartmentalized worlds, stativism allows us to go beyond

established borders. The May 2012 colloquium brought together

researchers specialized in the study of statistics, activists accustomed

to using numbers to advance their causes and, finally, visual artists

whose inspiration lies in quantification and contemporary management

techniques using numbers. We thus show that academic criticism, social

criticism and artistic criticism converge.

interests. Finally, the fourth produces alternative indicators to redefine

the meaning of our actions.

In this context, stativism takes on a particular meaning when it

designates methods specifically linked to neoliberal government.

adequacy also applies to criticism tools, even when they are
quantitative. Each form of authority has its own form of opposition.

by Pierre Bourdieu and Jean-Claude Passeron, in which the authors showed that, in

France, school did not mitigate cultural inequalities among children ; on the contrary,

it aggravated them by recognizing and validating the cultural capital of those who

received it from their families. This was demonstrated by crossing variables, in

particular the father's Occupation Classification4 with different measures of student

life and academic success, in order to show that they are the children of parents

belonging to social categories who already have significant cultural capital that

manage to enter the most prestigious academic careers. In this way, this work

demonstrated what everyone, to some extent, already knew from experience. But it

totaled a series of individual experiences that were statistically objective, thus giving

each person a basis for understanding how this experience was the result, less of

their personal academic virtue, and more of a system of domination imposed on

everyone. Hence a guilt-removal effect.

Let's go back to the past to better follow the trajectory of statistical innovations in this

sense and, thus, better understand how, over time, they were accepted by the public.

It is interesting to highlight here that the classifications used and crossed were

official, that is, they were based on a reality consolidated by state institutions.

Coming from the “system” itself, they show its internal contradictions. The public

service of national education intends to remedy the injustices, appealing to the ethics

of the gift of teachers, who supposedly offer their knowledge for the general interest,

but, in fact, only restore and perpetuate the injustice.

The history of the connection between statistics and social emancipation is old.

An interesting example is offered by the book Les Héritiers (1964),3

Radical or reformist criticism, examples drawn from
the past

The long controversy over the price index in France is another

historical example of the critical reach of statistics (Desrosières, 2014;

Touchelay, 2014). Historians show the trajectory of alternative price

indices from the beginning of the 1970s until the 1990s. During this period,

the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) published the results of an

index of its own elaboration, different from that presented by the National

Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). The CGT's argument

was that the INSEE index was based on premises that were very much in

line with the mode of consumption of the middle classes, very different
from that of the working classes.

Initially, the CGT index was very successful and was used – along

with the INSEE index – in salary negotiations. Even the media sometimes
took into account its variations (Piriou, 1992). However, from the end of

the 1980s, it began to fall into disuse, until the CGT decided to completely

stop its development during the 1990s. How could this index be accepted

at first, until it gradually lost its appeal and , finally disappear altogether?

Desrosières (2014) offers a sociological explanation: he considers that

does not allow us to capture what this author calls existential
criticism. These radical criticisms, which generally come from artists,
consist of extracting important elements from the world, even if
these have not been institutionalized in one way or another

(Boltanski, 2014). Les Héritiers was not intended to prompt questions
about the very existence of the school. In line with the Marxistinspired
dichotomy between reformism and revolutionary radicalism
that occurred at the time, the book proposed, above all, a reformist
critique constructed from categories of institutional reality. The work
criticized the institution based on this. Anyway , the publication of
this book was a great success. According to Boltanski, the work
even “played a significant role in the change of collective spirit that preceded May 1968”.

5 Haacke also later published a book of dialogues with Pierre Bourdieu
(Bourdieu; Haacke, 1994).

On the opening day, the public found only one table, on which there were

questionnaires with about twenty questions on sociodemographic

characteristics and opinions on current events. A few days later, Haacke

added the results of his research to the installation in the form of boxes

representing graphs and histograms. These showed that the vast majority

of visitors had professional connections with the art world, belonged to an

educated middle class, with limited financial resources and who,

predominantly, declared themselves “liberal”, in the American sense of the

term. Haacke thus provided a contrast to another exhibition he was holding

in New York at the same time, where he displayed, without comment, the

many and opulent affiliations of the Guggenheim Museum trustees to the

boards of directors of large capitalist corporations . Thus, within the

institutional frameworks of the art world – prestigious New York galleries

and a museum – and through very consolidated categories, Haacke

exposed the political-social division that radically separated the public of

contemporary art and the elite that sponsors it. The statistical critique was

once again quite reformist, insofar as it relied on the institutions it intended

to undermine.

In the year that the CGT launched its index, the German artist Hans

Haacke set up an exhibition at the New York gallery John Weber with

similar objectives, one might say, to those of the aforementioned book The Heirs. 5

In any case, the fact is that the developers of these indices agreed on

the methodological apparatus that allowed them to be calculated and on

their institutional uses. Even though it has modified the products considered

in the consumer's “basket”, the CGT has appropriated the architecture of

the economic concepts that make such an index relevant. In this sense, the
critique was again reformist, not radical.

Statistical arguments meet reception conditions that are more or less

favorable to them and that can change over time.

Bourdieu was part of the long sociological tradition of using statistics,

which can be traced back to Durkheim's Suicide . Furthermore, he had

personal ties with statisticians at the National Institute of Statistics and

Economic Studies (INSEE) since the 1950s and even taught at the

National School of Statistics and Economic Administration (ENSAE) –
which trains the Institute's administrators – in the same year. of the

release of Les héritiers. Likewise, the CGT continued a long tradition

of producing social statistics that dates back, through trade unions, to

the end of the 19th century (Topalov, 1994). As for Hans Haacke, if he

apparently produced his questionnaires alone, he was also, in some

way, assisted sociologically by Howard Becker. Representatives of

this generation of stativists therefore used the rich intellectual and

institutional resources to which they had access to produce statistics.

medium, etc. –, these statistics do not radically question this reality

that, at the same time, they denounce; rather, they make it possible to

influence it, to reform it. Bourdieu and Passeron did not question the

school's existence, but they made reform possible; the CGT built a

tool that allowed it to exert more influence, but within the established

framework of salary negotiations; Finally, Haacke helped to found a

new movement called “Institutional Criticism”, which gained ground in
the existing artistic milieu. Access to institutional statistical resources

therefore had the joint effect of enabling reform and stabilizing the

framework within which these reforms found their place. Statativism

In many industries, and more and more often, each person must
keep a quantified report of his own activities, which is used

Operations: circumvent the rule

The scale of application of institutional statistics has changed a lot

since the 1970s. Before, they were applied to large institutions, large

aggregates – for example, the school system, salary negotiations by
sector, the world of art –, and stativism developed on this scale. Today,

in institutions, they are also used to evaluate individual agents.

Let's now skip the forty years that separate us from those times

In this way, a stativist practice, today very widespread, albeit quite

discreetly, for actors located at the bottom of the hierarchy, consists of

leaving room for maneuver within the scope of the statistical reports that

are imposed on them. This way of resisting evaluation consists of

behaving exactly like the managers, that is, not really trusting the letter of

the rule, in order to adapt it in a sense that is more suitable to what it

applies to . But the main difference between the top and the bottom of

the hierarchy is that, at the bottom, these readjustments are kept secret,

or, more accurately, they are carried out discreetly because they are

considered illegitimate, while at the top they can be proclaimed to be

nothing more than than salutary adaptations of the rule, demonstrations

of complacency and flexibility (Boltanski, 2009). Stativist emancipation,

in this case, consists, for the dominated, on the one hand, in a free

interpretation of the rule and, on the other, in making public and legitimate a current practice, but kept hidden.

fight against price increases. The LKP, the group that gave rise to the movement, did

not believe in the price index produced by the public administration and organized a

survey among traders to establish its own index. They came to the negotiating table

with this data, which allowed them to gain an advantage over the government advised

by the employers' union. But suddenly, even during the discussions, Secretary of

State Yves Jégo, who was in charge, was removed from the process, possibly

because he was considered too open to activists. It was, on the part of the government,

an attempt to transform the framework of the negotiations, at the center of which were

the statistics, which seemed to be badly routed. The LKP reacted, changing the

picture in turn: bonfires were lit at the main road crossings on the island, violent acts

were practiced against commercial establishments, soon popular violence came to

strengthen the negotiators, and the local numbers. The state had no choice but to

grant them almost anything they asked for. It is seen here that the feint can occur not

discreetly, but very openly, in negotiations related to numbers, as well as in any

diplomatic relationship.

The emancipatory effect of this second-level stativism is twofold.
On the one hand, it seeks to highlight the possibility of an aggregated

reality different from the one established by the institution. For example,

he proclaims: “no, contrary to what the State says, we have shown that

criminality is not in continuous decline, because this decline is better explained by

These sociological, artistic, and militant cases illustrate a two-step

stativism. At the first level, it concerns all agents of an administration and

requires only minimal resources to be put into practice; in particular, it

does not require statistical know-how , as this discipline is not taught to

police officers. It consists of appropriating the data production rules that

serve for self-assessment in order to, more or less discreetly, more or

less openly, adapt them to one's own interests – which can range from

pure weakness and flattery to the boss's expectations to the proudest

independence in the production of works of art. Statistical activity requires

coding, without which there would be no quantified data, but coding,

which, in most cases, is left in the hands of the most dominated agents in

the hierarchy, necessarily leaves them with room for manoeuvre. It always

opens possibilities for them (Thévenot, 1983). To the extent that, as today,

the coder is the person himself who will be evaluated by the data he

encodes, he uses this possibility to his advantage. She emancipates

herself.

On a second level, stativism consists of bringing together all these

local practices and showing that, however silent they may be, they are so

common that the entire institution can be accused of not really pursuing

the objectives it claims. The statist must then resolve the paradox of being

both inside and outside the institution. In fact, it is impossible to obtain a

trail of the coders' discreet operations without being with them inside the

institution and, at the same time, one must have access to a public

platform to report on an aggregate level what has been witnessed. This is

why stativists tend to work in pairs or groups, the typical case being a

police officer associated with a sociologist.

coding manipulations by the police”. It then designates the
possibility of a reality different from the official one. At the same
time, it denounces, on the other hand, the institution's ability to falsify reality.

Stativism, therefore, covers a variety of practices ranging from the
most absolutely individual to the most collective level. It consists, on the

one hand, in freeing oneself from the rules that authority imposes and, on

the other hand, in revealing the lies it utters. But, at this stage, the

collective he builds is not yet a political subject, endowed with interests

and wills of its own. We will now demonstrate how this subjectification is

statistically possible.

Recent transformations in society have given rise to new social

categories. As was shown in the case of executives (Boltanski, 1982), to

gain recognition, social groups are interested in institutionalizing

themselves statistically. The invention of new social categories – and their

critique – is already, and should be even more so, an important field of

stativism. It concerns, for example, the case of intellectuals in precarious

working conditions, which we will detail here; but many other examples

come to mind, in particular the struggles of ethnic minorities, which deserve long discussions.

Here, the statement is: “the State has the means to lie to us”. It is,

therefore, not about reality that the doubt weighs, but about the action of

the State, which can claim to do one thing (fight crime) while doing another

(manipulate public opinion). The state activists, then, denounce the

possibilities of State action. The latter, of course, does not let himself be

carried away and, as we were able to show elsewhere, when resuming

the structure of fencing moves, the series of attacks and counter-attacks

between the State and stativists is far from over (Didier, 2011b ).

Among the social worlds most strongly affected by the
development of neoliberal governmentality is that of artists and professions

The struggles for definition between the new classes that intend to

case, the discreet denunciation) of new beings is an important front of

statism involving statistical categories. They are part of the definition of

group in question here has, by definition, quite rich cognitive resources

that can apparently compensate for any specific ignorance in statistics.

Faced with these attempts to aggregate a collective subject, the artist

Neoliberal governmentality makes great use of indicators. An indicator

is a measurement that transforms a complex phenomenon into a single,

simple value that varies over time. The price index, for example, must indicate

the variation in the cost of products to the consumer – and, therefore, in the

purchasing power of families – and allow variations to be monitored. The

indicator is used to give meaning, to guide action. Anyone who wants to see

an increase in purchasing power must find ways to control price developments.

You can, for example, choose

It differs from the case observed in the police, in which statism is of the order

of revelation: it breaks the institutional reality that proclaims itself with

quantified results, by showing the other reality of widespread cheating and

tricks with numbers. Here, stativism is positive, it seeks to prove that a

category actually exists, when it is not recognized as having existence, and

seeks the means of action that allow its defense. Of course , disclosure and

assertion are not mutually exclusive, and in many cases they are intertwined.

However, these two notions allow us to trace an axis that goes from the

denial of a pre-existing reality to the affirmation of entities that do not yet

exist. But, once the axis has been drawn, the most interesting thing is to

understand the complexity of the mixtures observed between the two extreme

poles of the continuum. This is what the last part of this article is dedicated

to, focusing on indicators.

fight against monetary inflation. But, by construction, an indicator retains from

the real only some aspects considered relevant: here, only those products

that are taken into account in the “basket” of the average family, and no others.

Emancipation, therefore, has a double meaning: it refers, firstly , to the

activity of constituting this collective political subject and, secondly , to the

alignment of a series of possibilities for action by this subject.

Perverse effects can be counted in two ways. On the one hand,
obviously unpleasant facts are placed in a series to make their
systematic and repeated character visible. An even more effective case,
which turns out to be extremely violent, is the case of the number of

suicides at France Telecom, the French telephone company, which was
being privatized in a very brutal way. Ivan Du Roy (2009) explains how
trade unionists had to count the suicides that occurred in the company
to reveal the harmfulness of the management methods that had been implemented.

It thus contributes to consolidating only some aspects of reality and,
therefore , neglecting others, which may, however, be considered
priorities according to different points of view of the indicator. This can
lead to serious political crises associated with these measures. Thus,
in Argentina, in 2007, it was demonstrated that the government had
tried to manipulate the price index by controlling only the prices taken
into account by government statisticians (called upon to disclose them)
and not other products. In response, a new index emerged, the “Billion
Prices Project”, developed by private economists at MIT, who “mined”
the prices offered on the internet by a small number of distributors and
produced a different aggregation, but evolving day by day, and largely
contradicting the official figures – which were devalued by the scandal
(Lury; Gross, 2014). Many other stativist experiences intervene at this
level: so that official statistics redistribute the institutions' action priorities,
they advocate taking into account other aspects of reality and propose
alternative indicators.

Among the latter, some point to the unsuspected perverse effects
of public or managerial policies. Others point to the importance and
relevance of elements that are not taken into account by official
quantitative measures. Some allow us to count what does not (yet)
count, others to discuss the indisputable.

Among the struggles that use indicators as weapons or targets,
that of the trade unionists at France Telecom must be treated
separately. These stativists came up with this simple and devastating
idea of counting suicides, which certainly doesn't require very
sophisticated statistical skills, but rather human qualities to find the
families of people who ended their lives, understand their desperate
gesture and determine whether or not it is related. to their working conditions. In others

As for artists, the Superflex group pushes criticism of activity
indicators to the level of absurdity. The Visitors Numbers project
consists of synchronizing the visitor counting mechanism at the
entrance of a museum with a large counting board hanging outside,

the only thing that mattered was the museum is very visited. It is ,
therefore, with bitter irony, to highlight the neoliberal way of managing
museums so much that its absurdity becomes tangible.

shootings have multiplied in the daily lives of Rio de Janeiro residents,
especially in favelas and urban outskirts. These places live under the
“crossfire” of violent actions carried out, on the one hand, by police
forces and, on the other, by armed groups of drug traffickers and
militiamen who control these neighborhoods. Although ad hoc
operations are one of the main reasons for crossfire and violent deaths
in Rio de Janeiro, there is no available data on these actions that
could fuel the public debate on public security in Rio de Janeiro. A
collaborative research project between researchers and activists from
the city of Rio de Janeiro enabled the construction of a database on
“specific operations”, characterized as incursions by security agencies
(civil and military) in favelas and popular neighborhoods.6 The project
Collaborative aims, therefore, to expand collective reflection on the
problem of public security in Brazil, building data that qualifies the

When examining more contemporary practices, we saw that, firstly, they
consist of highlighting and taking advantage of all the margins of freedom
that the rules for producing ciphers leave to the agents who are subject to them.

If we now return to the axis composed of revelation and affirmation, we
will place the count of suicides on the side of the purest revelation, affirming
nothing other than the emptiness of death in the face of the established

order, and then the artistic act that consists in ridiculing this system, which it
is not entirely negative in that it offers a new place where the system is
displayed. Then comes the count of shootings, which aims to institute
another measure of violence that takes into account that produced by the
police. Many methods of emancipation therefore occur between the
destruction of the institution's goals and the affirmation of alternative ends.

Statativism is a banner that brings together a wide variety of practices
that have in common that they place statistics at the service of emancipation.

Statistics is not a body of immutable laws; on the contrary, those who
practice it learn to play with it without making mistakes or infractions.
Second , stativism consists of using various methods of quantification to
produce groups, subjects that arise from an aspiration to emancipate
themselves from the conditions to which they are subject. Unity is strength,
and statistics are one of the first foundations of these unions. Finally, it
consists of redefining the objectives pursued by institutions through statistics. No

institutional means knowing them well enough to analyze, decompose and
recompose them or, like Superflex, copy them and publish them elsewhere.
This stativism requires certain technical knowledge. Its effectiveness,
then, largely depends on knowing why institutional indicators should
be questioned, and for what purpose. Once again, stativism is
emancipatory to the extent that it gives the possibility of making
certain material realities exist, using them for certain objectives,
certain ends, which are yet to be determined.

Accurately denounced as the basic equipment of the “iron cage” of
capitalist reason, quantification should not, however, be neglected in
favor of the exaltation of qualities, singularities and the immeasurable.

These practices cut across the fields of art, research and activism, all of which

highlight the value of statistics as a political argument.

Above all, if a certain form of activism by numbers has become essential

today, it is, in the first place, due to the central role played by the instruments of

quantification in maintaining the fatalities against which the struggles for

emancipation begin. Indeed, coding, categories, indicators, in short, all statistical

entities make a decisive contribution to building sustainable realities.

Such a waiver would be a mistake, because the restrictive stability of statistical

entities is not unshakable. On the contrary, the attention given to the instigation

of measures and indicators reveals their creative character and, many times, their

there is reason to let the elements of reality that determine the direction of our
actions impose on us. In all three cases, it is a question of taking into account

the authority of the facts, but without ever forgetting that we participate in its

realization, in particular, thanks to statistics, which allow us to articulate it with

the elements of the world to which we have privileged access.

In particular, it dispels one of the misunderstandings that divide potential

opposition to authoritarianism by numbers. In fact, although the Romantic

tradition – developed with industrialization and still alive today in new forms – is

a powerful source of criticism, it tends to perceive statistics only as an emanation

of the “cold, quantifying spirit of the industrial age”, embodied, for example, by

the character Thomas Gradgrind, in Dickens (Löwy; Sayre, 2010, p. 20).

However, the range of statist experiences we have gathered includes uses of

numbers that manage to keep in touch with the mechanisms of the neoliberal

city, while at the same time being situated at the level of free creativity. Far from

extending the existential desert of utilitarianism, protest inventions based on

numbers extend the autonomy of actors and can, at times, present, in addition

to their emancipatory scope, an aesthetic value.

ability to eclipse the older ones. A means of reducing uncertainties or
opening up practical possibilities, statistics is also a disciplinary
crossroads (mathematics, social sciences, accounting, administration,

etc.) where new encounters can be stimulated.

From there, “another number is possible”: what a hegemonic logic of
quantification has established, an informed statist practice can seek to
undo or, at least, shake it. This deviation from the slogan of alterglobalization
is not here the enchantment of an indeterminate possible,

Bakhtin (1982) allows us to understand why. He shows, based on the
work of François Rabelais, also peppered with games with numbers, that
the structure of laughter is ambivalent. On the one hand, it depreciates
official reality, through irony, parody and hyperbole. This is a well-known
humorous lever, operated in particular by Superflex. But that is not all. On
the other hand, laughter accompanies the joy of the counter-proposal, the
materialization of a new unexpected reality, the freedom conquered from
the shackles of the established reality, the productive transformation.
Bakhtin speaks of the “ creative force of laughter” (Bakhtin, 1982, p. 80).
He writes that “laughter debases and materializes” (p. 29), it is concomitant
with the degradation of the officer who was great, and with the
materialization and liberation, from the growth of what is most consistent
with reality. The works of Le Chevalier, de Prévieux with the police of the
14th arrondissement, illustrated this wonderfully. And also the works of
Pierre Bourdieu, who said: “sociology should be fun” and tried to make his
readers smile thanks to “a new use of statistics” (Gollac, 2004, p. 29).
Emancipation can also take the form of collective laughter.7

Finally, we will insist, like Ted Porter (2013), on the humor
present in these statist approaches. We could, a priori, think that
nothing is further from laughter than numbers, and yet this is not the case.

“statativism” as a militant use of quantification 105

7 Bakhtin insists that Rabelaisian laughter, productive and affirmative laughter, is popular. It is
found in carnivals, fairs, on the stages of public theaters. This point allows us to reconsider the
criticism that Boltanski (2009) qualifies as existential and that he previously attributes to artists
who work in romantic solitude. Existential criticism can, without a doubt, also be humorous and
collective.

possible in a direction desired and, it is hoped, favorable to the majority.
Of course, the fate of an alternative indicator or the enumeration of a

new social category is uncertain. These initiatives can “establish
themselves” in the public space or go unnoticed. What is certain is that,
in comparison with other intellectual productions, debates and disputes
concerning numbers in society tend to take on a notable practical
significance and, why not, a happy – even comic – comeback.
