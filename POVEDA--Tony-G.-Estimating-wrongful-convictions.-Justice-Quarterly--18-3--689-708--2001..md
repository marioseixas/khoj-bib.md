ESTIMATING WRONGFUL
CONVICTIONS*

TONY G. POVEDA**
State University of New York at Plattsburgh

Although numerous cases of wrongful convictions have been documented in
the literature and in the media, criminologists have yet to devise a methodology
for estimating the extent of such errors in the criminal justice system.
I explore several methodologies with this purpose in mind, including the use
of official data, inmates' self-reports, and case study approaches. Specifically,
I use court-ordered discharges from imprisonment as a basis for measuring
official error. In addition, I employ data from the RAND inmate
surveys to estimate the extent of convicted offenders who deny their commitment
offenses. Studies that attempt to catalogue individual wrongful
convictions also serve as a basis for estimating false positive errors. Each
methodology has its own limitations, but by employing multiple measures
and approaches, I make possible an estimate of the "dark figure" of wrongful
convictions.

The extent of wrongful convictions has been a topic of much
speculation and remains a "dark figure" in the study of criminal
justice. One of the few attempts to estimate the prevalence of
wrongful convictions was a 1986 study by C. Ronald Huff and associates.
In that research a variety of justice system officials (mostly
in Ohio) were surveyed for their perceptions of this type of miscarriage
of justice in felony cases (Huff, Rattner, and Sagarin 1986,

1996). 1 More recently, a statistical study of errors in capital cases

conducted by James Liebman and colleagues has highlighted the

extent of reversible error in capital cases, some of which involve the

erroneous conviction of the innocent (Liebman, Fagan, and West

2000). 2 Research on the scope of the wrongful-conviction problem is

still in its infancy; it is plagued by methodological problems and by

the absence of any central entity for tracking official errors in the

justice system.

A 1998 scholarly exchange between Richard Leo, Richard Ofshe,
and Paul Cassell underscores the difficulty of quantifying the

wrongful-conviction problem but also highlights its importance for
public policy 3 (Cassell 1998; Leo and Ofshe 1998a, 1998b). 4 The
present article is a preliminary effort at exploring several methodologies
for estimating wrongful convictions. I emphasize two approaches
to the problem: the use of official records on court-ordered
discharges from imprisonment, and data from inmates' self-reports.

DEFINING WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS

Wrongful convictions can be understood along a continuum of

justice-system errors ranging from persons who are falsely accused

(arrested, prosecuted, and tried), to those who are wrongly convicted
and imprisoned, to death row inmates who are erroneously

executed. In this article I focus on errors that result in the conviction
and imprisonment of innocent persons. These are wrongperson
errors, as distinct from procedural errors in the conviction of

a defendant. Although this distinction is sometimes difficult to

maintain in practice, wrong-person convictions are cases in which

1 The great majority of respondents (71.8%) in the Huff study estimated that
fewer than 1 percent of felony convictions involved innocent persons (Huff et al.
1986:523).
2 In the Liebman study of capital cases, 7 percent of persons whose death
sentences were overturned were found not guilty upon retrial, or charges against
them were dismissed (Liebman et al. 2000:132).
This is most evident in the movement for a moratorium on the death penalty.
The. release of 95 innocent death row inmates nationwide since 1973 (as of
May 7, 2001) has raised serious doubts about the administration of capital punishment
in the United States (Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) 2001; Dieter
1997). On January 31, 2000 Illinois became the first death-penalty state to issue
such a moratorium. In that state, for each death row inmate executed over the last
20 years, another has been released because of innocence (Johnson 2000).
4 The exchange between Leo/Ofshe and Cassell centered on the role of policeinduced
false confessions in producing wrongful convictions, the magnitude of the
problem, and the relevance of the Miranda warning to this issue. Cassell (1998)
maintained that the false-confession problem is minor compared with the problem of
lost confessions from guilty persons (and therefore lost convictions); this problem, he
argued, is due to restrictions on police interrogation. Leo and Ofshe (1998b) challenged
Cassell's attempt to quantify the false-confession problem and rejected his
claim that quantification is even necessary for public policy decisions. In addition,
they reaffirmed the importance of Miranda and the need to develop other procedural
safeguards to minimize false confessions and other sources of wrongihl convictions.

individuals are exonerated because they are factually (not merely
legally) innocent of the crime for which they were convicted--and
are not released solely on the grounds that their due process rights
were violated (e.g., by illegal search, Miranda warningnot given,
trial-court error). This definition is in the tradition of Edwin
Borchard's ([1932] 1970) classic study of wrongful convictions, the
landmark work of Hugo Bedau and Michael Radelet (1987; Radelet,
Bedau, and Putnam 1992) on erroneous convictions in capital cases,
and the research of Huff and associates (1986, 1996) on convicted
innocents.

On a conceptual level, wrongful convictions denote a distinct
type of justice-system error: when a wrong person has been convicted
and incarcerated. Operationally, however, it is difficult to
determine when someone is factually innocent, The fact that an offender's
conviction is overturned on appeal and that the offender is
acquitted in a subsequent trial does not in itself establish innocence.
It simply means that the state was not able to establish guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt. Clearly, "not guilty" and "innocent" are
not synonymous. For example, according to New York State's
Court of Claims Act (Article II, Sec.8-b), if innocent persons wish to
seek compensatory damages for unjust conviction and imprisonment,
they must "demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence"
that they did not commit the crime for which they were convicted
and incarcerated (New York State Court of Claims 1998). More is
required than merely showing that the conviction was vacated or
that the indictment against them was dismissed.

The problem is illustrated further by the April 2000 verdict in
the Sam Sheppard civil trial. The Sheppard jury had to determine
"by the greater weight of the evidence" whether Sheppard was innocent
and therefore wrongfully imprisoned by the State of Ohio for
the 1954 murder of his wife. The civil jury ruled that Sheppard's
family ~ had not met the burden of proof for innocence, even though
a 1966 jury, in Sheppard's second criminal trial, had found him not
guilty (Ewinger and Hagan 2000; Hagan and Ewinger 2000).

Thus, the operational definition of wrongful conviction for research
is problematic. What constitutes evidence and criteria for
innocence? How compelling should that evidence be? The tradition
of studying wrongful convictions, beginning with Borchard in 1932,
has erred on the side of a restrictive definition of wrongful conviction:
evidence is required showing that someone else committed the
offense or that the convicted person was uninvolved in the crime

Case" 2000).

(Gross 1998:129; Radelet and Bedau 1998:106). 6 Bedau and
Radelet (1987:47) maintained that "there is no quantity or quality
of evidence that could be produced that would definitively prove innocence."
At best, they argued, a "majority of neutral observers,
given the evidence at our disposal, would judge the defendant in
question to be innocent. ''7 Huff and his colleagues similarly included
only cases in which there was evidence of innocence "beyond
a reasonable doubt" (Huff et al. 1986:519) or when convicted persons
had been "clearly exonerated" (Huff et al. 1996:10).

An additional issue is whether such wrong-person errors must
be acknowledged by officials in the criminal justice system, particularly
by the courts. Surely the more restrictive definition would
consider only officially acknowledged errors. This criterion is followed
in Huffs database of felony cases (Huff et al. 1986:519).
Bedau and Radelet also relied on official judgment of error (e.g.,
appellate court decisions, executive pardons, indemnity claims) in
90 percent of their 416 capital cases. In the other 10 percent, however,
their decision to include the case was based on unofficial judgments.
These latter cases included research by scholars or
journalists who had reexamined evidence in a particular case (and
often had discovered new evidence), and had concluded that the defendant
was not guilty, even though no court had determined this
(Radelet et al. 1992:17-18). Insofar as we allow unofficial judgments
of error, we are shifting toward a more expansive definition
of wrongful conviction.

ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES

A critical methodological problem in the study of wrongful convictions
is how to determine the extent of such convictions and imprisonment
in the criminal justice system. The dominant approach
in the literature has been to catalogue individual cases of wrongful
conviction. This approach has been pursued by legal scholars, journalists,
sociologists, and other researchers (Borchard [1932] 1970;
Connors et al. 1996; Dieter 1997; Huff et al. 1996; Radelet et al.
1992; Radin 1964; Rosenbaum 1990-1991; U.S. House 1994; Yant
1991); none claim to have identified all such cases. Indeed, many of

6 Radelet and Bedau (1998:106-07) also note that the concept of innocence can
be broadened in a variety of ways including the counting of accidental killings, selfdefense,
and killings by a mentally ill offender.

7 The most one can hope to obtain is a consensus of investigators after the
case reaches its final disposition, Consensus can be measured in degrees, and the
cases that we have included in our catalogue are those in which we believe a majority
of neutral observers...would judge the defendant in question to be innocent"
(Bedau and Radelet 1987:47).

POVEDA 693

these researchers point to the role of tuck and chance in the discovery
of wrongful-conviction cases (U.S. House 1994:12). Bedau and
Radelet (1987:29) emphasized "how accidental and unsystematic
the discovery of relevant cases actually is." Gross (1998:150) concluded
that "most miscarriages of justice in capital cases never
come to light"; when they do so, it is typically because of heightened
judicial attention to the case, because the real criminal confesses, or
simply because of luck.

The fundamental flaw of the case study approach is that there
is no way to determine how many cases go undiscovered--the "dark
figure" of wrongful convictions--and whether these cases differ systematically
from those which are identified. The documenting of
individual cases has helped to sensitize the public and policy makers
to the existence of erroneous convictions, but it falls short as a
method for determining the prevalence of such convictions.
Another approach, taken especially since the late 1970s, has
been to employ laboratory or experimental methods in studying
mistaken eyewitness identification, a significant factor in many
wrongful convictions (Cutler and Penrod 1995; Loftus 1993, 1996;
Wells 1993). This research has attempted to discover error rates of
eyewitness identification under different experimental conditions,
with emphasis on police identification procedures in lineups, event
factors, and postevent information. Factors such as whether the
culprit is present or absent in the lineup, police instructions given
to the witness, the trauma of the crime, the use of a deadly weapon,
and information obtained by the witness after the crime are all relevant
to shaping the memory of an event and to eyewitnesses' accuracy
(Devine 1995; Loftus and Ketcham 1991; Wells 1993).
One problem with this line of research is that it is often based
on simulated events (staged crimes and lineups) rather than on actual
crimes; thus it raises questions of generalizability from experimental
to forensic ("real") contexts (Yuille 1993). Moreover, the
purpose of eyewitness identification experiments is to isolate the
role of particular factors in producing error, not to estimate the
overall accuracy of eyewitness identifications in actual cases (Cutler
and Penrod 1995). Thus, again, this methodology is limited in
providing an empirical basis for estimating the prevalence of
wrongful convictions. In 1999, however, when the Innocence Project
examined the 62 DNA exonerations to date in the United
States, it found that mistaken eyewitness testimony was a factor in
84 percent of those wrongful convictions (Scheck, Neufeld, and
Dwyer 2000:246).
Another possible line of inquiry is the use of field research to
determine the extent of error produced by a particular investigative

694 WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS

practice. Leo and Ofshe's research on police interrogations reflects
this approach (Leo 1996). Their fieldwork in a limited number of
police departments has led to observations on how standard police
interrogation practices can cause suspects to make false confessions
(Leo and Ofshe 1998a; Ofshe and Leo 1997). These authors, however,
make no claim that their methodology can be used to identify
the universe of false confessions. On the contrary, they maintain
that the "methodological problems inherent in arriving at a sound
estimate [of the frequency of false confessions] are formidable and
unsolved, and we have concluded that no welt-founded estimate has
yet been published" (Leo and Ofshe 1998b:560). Thus they are
quite skeptical about the possibility of quantification, given the absence
of official records on the number of police interrogations and
the frequency of false confessions resulting from those
interrogations.

Finally, another approach to discovering errors in the criminal
criminal justice system is the use of appellate court decisions in
which convictions or sentences have been overturned. This methodology
has been adopted by Liebman and associates in their research
on errors in capital cases. Liebman relied on published judicial decisions
at three levels of the capital review process: state direct appeal,
state postconviction appeal, and federal habeas corpus review.
This is a monumental task, as noted by Liebman, Fagan, and West
(2000:24): it requires a "painstaking search" for cases relying on various
sources of information. To complicate this task, there is no
central repository for these judicial decisions.

Liebman's study of capital errors between 1973 and 1995 began
in 1991 and continues today. Although appellate courts (at the
three review levels) found reversible error in 68 percent of capital
cases during the study period, Liebman's findings on the outcomes
of these reversals are limited to the 301 cases in the state postconviction
appeals. Upon retrial, 247 of the plaintiffs in the state
postconviction cases were sentenced to less than death, 22 (7%)
were found not guilty, and 54 were resentenced to death (Liebman
et al. 2000:132). As Liebman et al. (2000:27) pointed out, state
postconviction decisions, unlike state direct appeal and federal
habeas corpus reviews, often are not published and therefore are
difficult to locate. At the present, the list of such cases is incomplete.
The Liebman study has provided substantial evidence demonstrating
a high rate of error in capital judgments. So far,
however (except for the state postconviction results), it has provided
only limited information on the outcome of these reversals,
notably in regard to the prevalence of wrongful convictions.

POVEDA 695

As noted, criminal justice agencies do not keep statistics on errors
made by officials at various stages of the justice process, including
the number of persons wrongfully convicted and
imprisoned. In the remainder of this paper, I consider two different
approaches to this quantification problem. One approach employs
official agency records or statistics as a basis for constructing a
measure of wrongful convictions and imprisonment; the other relies
on inmates' self-reports of their own criminal activity, including denial
of committing the offense for which they were incarcerated.
The development of multiple methods for estimating wrongful convictions
has certain advantages. Insofar as each method has its
own limitations, the use of multiple and independent measures to
estimate the prevalence of wrongful convictions will increase our
confidence in the findings of each approach, if we assume a consistency
in results (Webb et al. 1966:3-5).

USE OF OFFICIAL STATISTICS ON
COURT-ORDERED DISCHARGES

This approach develops an estimate of wrong~l convictions
based on actions taken by justice officials, namely court-ordered
discharge of inmates from imprisonment. "Court-ordered discharge,"
however, is a broader category than "wrongful conviction":
it encompasses not only substantive errors (wrong-person convictions)
but also procedural errors in the conviction and sentencing of
the offender. Ultimately it is necessary to distinguish these two
types of errors if our use of these official data is to have merit.

Data From the New York State Department of Correctional
Services

A series of research reports and the availability of data from
the New York State (NYS) Department of Correctional Services
(DOCS) make New York a convenient jurisdiction for examining the
value of court-ordered discharges, s Every year the DOCS publishes
reports on inmates under its jurisdiction, but its annual report,
Characteristics of Inmates Discharged, is most relevant to this
study. The DOCS recognizes 10 categories of inmate release, including
parole, maximum expiration of sentence, escape, death,
court-ordered discharges, and others.
A court-ordered discharge is defined by the DOCS as a case
%vhere the individual is discharged from custody while further

Planning, Evaluation, and Research.

court proceedings take place (i.e., an appeal, new trial), or is discharged
as a result of court proceedings in which the individual is
found guilty of a lesser charge for which he may already have
served the length of time legally required, or discharged because
the original charge was dismissed" (DOCS 1997a:3). Over the 22-
year period from 1976 through 1997, the DOCS has averaged 155
court-ordered discharges per year. There were 199 such discharges
in 1995, the year that we examine here. Because of the relatively
small number of inmates discharged under court order in any single
year, the DOCS annual reports do not provide cross-tabulated data
on inmate characteristics for those who are released in this manner.
(Such data are available only for parole release.) The DOCS
Office of Program Planning, Evaluation, and Research, however,
provided me with more highly detailed information on the characteristics
of court-ordered discharges for 1995.

Measures of Wrongful Conviction

Unfortunately, the data mentioned above need further elaboration
and interpretation before we can make any inferences about
the extent of wrongful convictions. As stated earlier, official data
on court-ordered discharges do not distinguish between substantive
and procedural errors, and we are concerned with the former
(wrong-person convictions and imprisonment). Nothing in the official
data makes this distinction, except a 1989 DOCS report on vacated
murder sentences in New York. That study, conducted by the
New York State Department of Correctional Services, identified 33
offenders who had been convicted of murder and released from
DOCS custody between 1980 and 1987 for new trials. Those cases
"represent current instances where appellate courts found error so
substantial as to warrant the vacation of the conviction for murder"
(DOCS 1989:1).
In the DOCS follow-up analysis on those 33 cases, it was found
that on retrial the great majority (26, or 78.8%) were reconvicted of
a lesser offense (17 for first-degree manslaughter). The remaining
seven (21.2%) were acquitted after a new trial or after local prosecutors
dismissed the original indictment. 9 If we regard these seven
cases as wrong-person convictions, using acquittal after a new trial
or dismissal of indictment (following a court-ordered discharge) as
measures of wrongful conviction, this internal DOCS study offers
some empirical basis for estimating the proportion of court-ordered

9 Five of the seven cases involved acquittals; the other two, dismissals. It is
possible that the indictment dismissals were made on procedural grounds, but it is
more likely that the conviction reversal in appellate court undermined the evidentiary
basis for pursuing the case (e.g., recanted witness testimony, discovery of police
report exonerating defendant).

discharges that represents substantive error (21.2%), at least in regard
to murder convictions and commitm, ents.
Samuel Gross (1996, 1998) argues persuasively that homicide
cases in general, and capital cases in particular, are handled differently
by officials in the criminal justice system, and for a variety of
reasons are more likely to involve erroneous convictions. Therefore,
in line with Gross's thesis (and the limits of DOCS data), we must
limit our objective here to estimating the prevalence of wrongful
murder convictions rather than wrongful felony convictions.

Findings

An examination of 1995 DOCS data on court-ordered discharges
reveals that of the 199 inmates released from custody by
the courts, 24 (12.1%) had been convicted of murder (DOCS
1997a). 1° If we assume that only 21.2 percent 11 of these court-ordered
discharges represent substantive errors, then only five discharges
represent wrongful murder convictions. However, the
relevant population base for calculating prevalence of wrongful convictions
is the number of murder commitments to the Department
of Correctional Services. A study conducted by the New York State
Defenders Association (NYSDA) 12 found that the median time
from conviction to reversal (acquittal/dismissal) in wrongful homicide
convictions in New York is approximately three years (NYSDA
1989; Rosenbaum 1990-1991). 13 Accordingly, murder inmates released
by court-ordered discharge in 1995 were probably committed
to the Department of Correctional Services in 1992, when 357 murder
commitments were made to the DOCS (DOCS 1997b:10). If five
of these were wrongful convictions, this translates to an error rate
of 1.4 percent in murder convictions/commitments. 14

lo Data on the specific characteristics, including the commitment crime, of
1995 court-ordered discharges were provided by Paul Korotkin, assistant director of
program planning, evaluation, and research of the DOCS.
11 The 21.2 percent figure is based on the findings of the 1989 DOCS study on
vacated murder sentences.
12 The New York State Defenders Association is a nonprofit organization of
public defenders and legal aid atton]eys who provide services to criminal defense
lawyers throughout the state.
13 On the basis of the wrongful conviction cases cited in the NYSDA study, the
median time between conviction and inmate's release was 38.5 months. The DOCS
(1989:3) study placed the median at 29 months (from prison reception to reversal).
Even if we allow for some variation in the reversal period (from one to four years),
the average number of annual murder commitments in NYS between 1991 and 1994
was 370, only a slight departure from the 1992 figure of 357 that t used.
14 If we use the 7.3 percent figure (instead of the 21.2 percent from the DOCS
study), derived from the Liebman study of state postconviction reversals, as the basis
for estimating the proportion of errors involving wrong-person convictions in vacated
murder cases, the error rate ~br murder convictions/commitments is only .5
percent. The Liebman study, however, is based on an incomplete sample of capital
cases reviewed in state postconviction appeals (1973-1995) in 26 states (Liebman et
al. 2000:53), not including New York (which did not restore the death penalty until

698 WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS

The NYSDA study, described above, also attempted to catalogue
wrongful homicide convictions in New York State from 1965
to 1988. As part of its Wrongful Conviction Study Project, the study
identified 59 wrongful homicide convictions during this period, 45 of
which involved murder convictions (Rosenbaum 1990-1991:807-08).
The NYSDA's definition of wrongful homicide conviction, however,
was broader than that employed in the present study. It included
not only cases in which the defendant, whose conviction had been
overturned, was acquitted on retrial or the charges were dismissed,
but also cases in which the defendant was reconvicted of a
nonhomicide crime. If the NYSDA study cases are limited to murder
sentences reversed between 1980 and 1987 and to cases in
which the defendant was subsequently acquitted on retrial or the
indictment was dismissed (and omits cases in which the defendant
was reconvicted of a lesser offense), 15 we were left with 23 wrongful
murder convictions in New York State between 1980 and 1987.
During the period 1977 to 1984,16 2,276 murder commitments were
made to the Department of Correctional Services (Chapman and
Zausner 1985); this translates to a 1.0 percent error rate in murder
convictions/commitments.
The estimated prevalence of wrongful murder convictions
reached by using the NYSDA study (1.0%) is comparable to the estimate
of 1.4 percent calculated from DOCS data on court-ordered
discharges. This is the case even though very different methodologies,
each with its own assumptions and limitations, are used in
each approach. Both, however, are based on officially acknowledged
errors in which the convicted murder defendant has been released
from custody and subsequently is acquitted on retrial, or in
which the original indictment is dismissed.

USE OF INMATES' SELF-REPORTS

The use of inmates' self-reports is another methodological approach
to estimating the prevalence of wrongful convictions. Unlike
court-ordered discharges, which rely on the reliability and
validity of agency records, inmates' self-reports depend on the reliability
and validity of inmates' accounts of their own criminality.
The use of these self-reports provides another approach, with a different
set of assumptions and limitations, to the quantification
problem.

cases during the 1980-1987 period.
15 These parameters then correspond to those of the 1989 DOCS study.
16 This allows for a three-year lag period from conviction to reversal.

The RAND Inmate Survey

In late 1978 and early 1979, the RAND Corporation of Santa
Monica, California conducted surveys of convicted male offenders
(in 14 jails and 12 prisons) in California, Michigan, and Texas (Peterson
et al. 1982). The surveys were administered in small groups
(10 to 30 inmates) by temporary RAND employees who were hired
because of their experience in working with incarcerated inmates;
prison officials did not participate in these sessions.
The sample was representative of adult male inmates admitted
to prisons and jails in the above jurisdictions at the time of the survey.
Participation was voluntary and required informed consentF
Altogether self-report data were obtained from 1,380 prison inmates
and 810 jail inmates.

The questionnaire, which took about 50 minutes to complete,
asked for detailed information about crimes the inmates had committed
in a one- to two-year period preceding their incarceration,
including questions about arrests and convictions. The survey also
questioned inmates about their current conviction offense, demographic
characteristics, and other personal details. In addition, official
criminal records were collected on 85 percent of the prison
inmates who responded to the questionnaire (Peterson et al. 1982).

Measure of Wrongful Conviction

Although the purpose of the RAND Inmate Survey was to collect
data on criminal careers and to develop policy implications
from those data, two questionnaire items in the "1978 Jail/Prison
Survey Booklet" (Chaiken and Chaiken 1982:App. E) are relevant
to our research. These questions (Numbers 6 and 7 on p. 39 of the
booklet) pertain to the inmate's current offense: "What charge(s)
were you convicted of that you are serving time for now? (Check all
that apply)," and "For these convictions, what crimes, if any, do you
think you really did? (Check all that apply)." Each of these questions
is followed by a list of 15 different offenses, plus an "other"
category. In addition, the last response choice for the second question
is "Did no crime." Inmates' denials of the conviction offense
(i.e., self-reports that they "did no crime") provide another basis for
measuring wrongful conviction. Clearly, inmates who claim that

17 The response rate for jail inmates was 70 percent; for prison inmates in California
and Michigan, 50 percent; for prison inmates in Texas, 82 percent (Peterson et
al. 1982:viii). The RAND researchers attempted to correct the problem of
nonrespondents with a replacement procedure. Moreover, although the survey was
confidential, it was not anonymous. The questionnaires were coded to make future
identification of respondents possible for subsequent research (Peterson et al.
1982:x).

they are innocent of the offense for which they have been incarcerated
meet the operational definition of wrongful conviction.

Certainly, inmates' self-reports raise serious questions of reliability
and validity that must be addressed before we can take them
at face value. Built into the RAND research design were several
ways of checking on the internal consistency (reliability) as well as
the validity of responses. These included asking respondents for essentially
the same information in different parts of the questionnaire,
retesting some of the respondents a week later, and
comparing inmates' responses with official records. Overall, "83
percent of respondents tracked the questionnaire with a high degree
of accuracy and completeness, and were very consistent in
their answers" (Chaiken and Chaiken 1982:224-25).

When researchers compared questionnaire data with the
prison inmates' official records, is they found a close correspondence.
In fact, in California and Texas, respondents reported 6 percent
more convictions than the records show; in Michigan,
convictions were underreported by 6 percent (Marquis and Ebener
1981:34). Inmates were reluctant, however, to provide information
on sex offenses, including rape; these are more likely than other
offenses to be understated in self-reports (Peterson et al. 1982:21).
There was also evidence that some errors in inmate-reported crimes
were due to confusion about offense categories; thus the problem
was one of misclassification rather than omission. For example,
"robbery" and "theft" were sometimes confused (Marquis and
Ebener 1981:38).
In assessing the quality of prisoners' self-reports, RAND researchers
began with the conventional wisdom that respondents
are likely to conceal undesirable information about themselves. After
reviewing the methods literature as well as results from the
RAND Inmate Survey, however, they concluded just the opposite:
"We found evidence that respondents usually reveal more arrests
and convictions in questionnaires or interviews than can be found
in official records" (Marquis and Ebener 1981:2). Moreover, the
RAND evaluation of inmates' self-reports specifically examined the
quality of reports on questionnaire items pertaining to the current
offense. The investigators concluded that "on a general level, the
data are close to unbiased" (Marquis and Ebener 1981:32). Although
the RAND researchers observed item-by-item variation,

is This portion of the assessment of the quality of responses was limited to
prisoner respondents because official records were available only for prisoners, not
for jail inmates. RAND researchers used official records to check the correspondence
between prisoners' self-reports and official arrests and convictions.

they found in general that reliability was "moderately high" (Marquis
and Ebener 1981:32). Overall the RAND findings refute the
widely held belief that inmates are likely to underreport their criminal
activity: "In general, the prisoner respondents do not appear to
be systematically denying their conviction offenses in the questionnaire"
(Marquis and Ebener 1981:47).

Method

The RAND Inmate Survey (National Archive of Criminal Justice
Data 2000; Peterson et al. 1982) is available to the public at the
National Archive of Criminal Justice Data website. 19 Because I
was interested in only a few of the variables contained in the survey,
I extracted those variables from the RAND data set to create a
smaller data set for analysis. Any cases with missing data were
eliminated. The specific variables in the newer, smaller data set
included current conviction offense, crimes actually committed,
state, and type of institution. In addition, because in the present
study I am interested in wrongful convictions and imprisonment at
the felony level, I examined only data on prison inmates: 1,282
cases in Michigan, California, and Texas.

Findings

The basic finding is that 197 of the 1,282 prison inmates questioned
in the RAND Survey, or 15.4 percent, claimed that they did
not commit the crime for which they had been convicted and imprisoned.
(See Table 1) Those inmates also denied committing any of
the other 15 crimes included on the "current conviction offense"
checklist, including "other." This finding did not vary widely by
state: 14.1 percent of Michigan prisoners denied having committed
any crime, as did 14.6 percent in California and 16.7 percent in
Texas.
Denials varied more widely, however, by current conviction offense.
Rapists and other sex offenders denied their conviction offense
at the highest rates by far: 37.7 and 26.9 percent
respectively. Those convicted of murder, weapons violations, assault,
and robbery fell into the middle range: 17.5, 13.4, 12.8, and
11.5 percent respectively denied their offense. Drug and nonviolent
property offenders were least likely to deny their conviction offense.
It is possible that in this rather lengthy, complex questionnaire
the inmate respondents misunderstood the two key questions that
are of concern to us. Specifically, in marking "Did no crime," they

may not have understood their response. As a check on respondents'
confusion, I examined whether inmates who reported that
they "did no crime" (in response to question 7 in the booklet) also
indicated, nonetheless, that they really had committed another
crime. Such a response, of course, would be contradictory to the
question "What crimes, if any, did you really commit?" This did not
seem to be a problem, however: only 19 (1.5%) of the inmate respondents
indicated that they had committed no crime and yet
checked one of the other crime categories on the list.

Overall, inmates' reports of their conviction crime corresponded
to crime they actually committed. For example, 103 inmate respondents
reported that they had been convicted of murder, and 70 of
those respondents admitted that they had committed murder.
Many of the remaining 33 respondents admitted to crimes less than
murder (e.g., manslaughter, robbery) and therefore questioned the
state's classification of the crime they had committed, but only 18
claimed that they had committed no crime at all. Similarly, 382
inmate respondents reported a conviction of robbery, and 287 admitted
that they had committed that crime. Only 44 of the remaining
95 respondents convicted of robbery claimed that they had
committed no crime. This pattern holds for the great majority of
crimes; the exceptions are rape and other sex offenses, for which the
rate of denial was much higher. In the case of rape, 61 inmate respondents
reported a conviction of rape, only 17 conceded that they
had committed that crime, and 23 claimed to have committed no
crime at all.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The prevalence of wrongful convictions as measured by inmates'
self-reports is significantly greater than the estimate derived
from using official data based on court-ordered discharges
(15% versus 1%). 20 This finding perhaps is not surprising, but it
does not support the idea that alternative methodologies might produce
similar results.
Although the RAND assessment of prisoners' self-reports challenged
the conventional wisdom that inmates in general deny their
criminal activities, some prisoners nonetheless have a variety of
self-serving motives for underreporting their crimes. Even though
they have been convicted and imprisoned, some inmates still may
have forthcoming appeals, and therefore, in spite of the anonymity
or confidentiality of a survey, a personal stake in minimizing their
involvement in the conviction crime. It is also possible, as Loftus
(1996) argued so persuasively with eyewitness testimony, that postevent
information may reshape inmates' memories of their criminal
conduct, including their current conviction offenses. 21 Perhaps defense
arguments and accounts of the crime presented at trial or on
appeal, by minimizing or denying defendants' involvement, may
subtly influence memories of the actual crime. 22
It may also be that inmates' perceptions of their criminal conduct
are at variance with the legal definition. For example, Koss,
Gidycz, and Wisniewski (1987), who researched the prevalence of
rape on college campuses, observed that male offenders tended not
to recognize their conduct as rape; yet they admitted to having sex
with a female against her will. 23 This disparity in definitions of

20 Technically, the comparison here should be between 17.5 percent (the proportion
of convicted murderers denying the charges in the RAND survey) and the 1.4
percent error rate for murder convictions/commitments based on court-ordered
discharges.
21 This is evident in the growing number of cases where postconviction DNA
testing provides incriminating evidence rather than exonerating the inmate. A case
in point is that of Texas death row inmate Ricky McGinn. In June 2000 Governor
George Bush gave McGinn a 30-day reprieve to allow time for DNA testing before his
execution. All of the DNA results subsequently showed a match between McGinn
and evidence recovered from the victim. Even so, McGinn maintained his innocence
(Texas Man" 2000). This also occurred in the Scott William Davi case in South
Dakota: Davis's DNA results provided a match confirming the rape and murder of
his ex-wife. Davi, too, maintained his innocence. The results of DNA testing at two
major forensic laboratories (Forensic Science Associates and Cellmark) have confirmed
prisoners' guilt in 60 percent of the cases (Cohen 2000:A1).
~2 Penningten and Hastie (1993) have written about the "story model" of juror's
decision making, arguing that prosecutors and defense attorneys construct stories of
the crime to make it more understandable to the jury. The story then is a way to
organize the facts of the case in a manner consistent with the prosecution or the
defense version of events. These "stories" might later influence the defendants'
recollections of their crimes.

sexual relations.

rape (legal versus offender's definition) perhaps accounts for much
of the underreporting of rape (and other sex offenses) in the RAND
Inmate Survey. Another possibility, as noted by the RAND researchers,
is that inmates misclassify their offense, perhaps confusing
robbery with theft or murder with manslaughter. It is more
difficult, however, to understand the complete denial of an inmate's
conviction offense, short of lying or wrongful conviction.

An earlier RAND survey of 624 California male prisoners also
concluded that "inmates did not deny committing crimes" (Peterson,
Braiker, and Polich 1981:xxi), but found that 81 (13%) of those
inmates denied committing any of the 11 crimes on the survey list.
Peterson and his colleagues (1981:20) maintained that about half of
the 81 had committed a crime not on their list; about 6 percent denied
committing any crime, including the crime for which they had
been imprisoned. Although this figure is less than the approximately
15 percent denial rate found in the 1978 RAND Inmate Survey,
it is larger than the i percent estimate of wrongful convictions
based on court-ordered discharges.

The two approaches employed in this study to estimate the
prevalence of wrongful convictions not only resulted in different
outcomes, but also are based on different methodologies. One
draws on officially acknowledged error (court-ordered discharges);
the other, on the uncorroborated claims of prisoners (inmates' selfreports),
and thus on a more expansive definition of wrongful conviction.
Because court-ordered discharges are the result of inmates
who pursue their claims of justice-system error (whether substantive
or procedural), it is not surprising that the outcome of that process
will yield a smaller estimate, given the attrition of cases.
Moreover, future research on court-ordered discharges must continue
to distinguish between persons released for procedural and
for substantive reasons, and must reexamine the proportion of
cases involving wrong-person convictions. 24 Although the extent of
wrongful convictions remains a "dark figure," the divergent fmdings
of the two approaches used here may delineate the parameters
of the problem: prevalence ranges from 1 to 15 percent, depending
on assumptions and operational definitions.
Future research also must take into account variation in
wrongful convictions over time. Drawing on Packer's (1968) distinction
between "crime control" and "due process," Huff and his colleagues
(1996:143-44) note a possible link between wrongful

24 The 21.2 percent estimate used in this study is based on one study, the 1989
DOCS research on vacated murder convictions, which needs to be explored more
fully.

convictions and a crime-control model of the criminal justice process.
This suggests that in historical periods which emphasize
crime control over due process (as in "get tough" crime policies), errors
of justice are also more likely, including wrongful convictions.
Until now, the absence of a methodology for measuring justice-system
error has made this proposition untestable.

Estimating the prevalence of wrongful convictions is not
merely a matter of academic interest. IZ~owing the magnitude and
scope of the problem has important public policy implications. Although
we may never know exactly how many innocent persons
have been convicted and imprisoned, the extent of this problem indicates
how well (or how poorly) our criminal justice system is sorting
the guilty from the not guilty; certainly this is a major goal of
the system. The extent of error provides a quality control mechanism
and alerts us to systemic flaws, whether they pertain to mistaken
eyewitness identification, police interrogation practices,
ineffective counsel, or the use ofjailhouse informers.

In a 1999 report by the Institute of Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS), it was estimated that medical mistakes
annually kill from 44,000 to 98,000 hospital patients (Corrigan,
Kohn, and Donaldson 1999). The report emphasized the systemic
basis for most errors in the health care system, rather than individual
recklessness, and identified some of the organizational measures
that can be taken to prevent death and injury from medical
mistakes (NAS 1999). Although officials and providers in the
health care system have been slow 25 to recognize the extent of
medical mistakes and their implications for public safety, this report
represents a reversal.

Officials in the criminal justice system can learn from the
experience of other institutions by publicly acknowledging justicesystem
errors, conducting inquiries when they occur, and beginning
to quantify the extent of the problem. 26 Only then can the problem
of wrongful convictions be addressed in terms of systemic flaws, not
merely as individual wrongdoing nor as honest mistakes that are
quickly forgotten.

25 Action has been slow in relation to some other sectors of the economy in
which public safety issues are well established, such as the airline and automobile
industries and workplace safety in general. Medical malpractice suits, of course,
have contributed to the health care system's reluctance to publicly acknowledge
medical mistakes.
26 In May 2000, New York Governor George Pataki proposed legislation to cre~
ate a DNA Review Committee. This committee would have the authority to review
cases in which DNA has exonerated offenders, and to recommend legal or procedural
changes to prevent future recurrences ("Gov. Pataki" 2000).
